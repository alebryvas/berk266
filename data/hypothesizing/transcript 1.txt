hello everyone and welcome to another
00:07
video in this tutorial I will show you
00:10
how to get a transcript of a YouTube
00:12
video so if you want to get a text from
00:15
our YouTube video I will show you how to
00:18
do that so first go ahead and select and
00:21
open your desired video that you want to
00:23
get the text from just not that this
00:25
method is only working for the videos
00:28
that have closed captioning so to get a
00:31
text from a video the video should have
00:34
this CC icon if it doesn't have these CC
00:37
icons or does mean this method it won't
00:40
work so when you select a video and it
00:44
does have these closed captions haikon
00:47
go ahead and click on more
00:51
and then click on transcripts
00:54
here you will see all the text from the
00:58
video so you will see the text and the
01:00
timing of the text
01:03
and then you can just copy the text and
01:05
paste it so no text document file
