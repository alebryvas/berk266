So, yesterday, I got a comment, from one you subscriber In which, he said
00:03
The reason, he liked my videos more, is because
00:05
I use subtitles in all of them
00:07
And this, let me wondering.
00:09
It only take me a minute or two to generate subtitles..
00:16
And then hit me,
00:17
Maybe people don’t know,
00:19
you can generate subtitles automatically
00:23
Hi there this is Mrinal once again And in this video we’ll see
00:26
A simple way, To automatically Create subtitles and closed
00:28
captions For your YouTube videos
00:30
or any video for that matter. like
00:33
if you have a foreign movie clip whose subtitles are not on the internet
00:37
This method might work.
00:38
or if you someone, who makes money by transcripting
00:41
videos on fiverr or rev Then this trick will make your life a lot
00:45
easier ----
00:46
Now, If you are interested Only in the workaround
00:47
Go to the time stamps, you see on the screen
00:50
But I suggest you watch the entire video You will not definitely learn many new things
00:56
But my watch time, will increase, making this video rank higher (haha)
01:00
---
01:01
So, most guides on the internet Suggest you write down the captions manually,
01:05
Some popular blogs even suggest, paying 5$ on fiverr
01:09
And then There are companies like rev,
01:10
that are charging $1 for 1 minute of captions.
01:13
I mean comon, We are living in the world of AI and
01:17
Still companies are charging for the product That can be done for free.
01:22
--- But guess what,
01:23
You don’t have to do, any of that.
01:24
Right now, I’m using the same method to automatically generate Subtitles for any
01:28
video.
01:29
And yes,
01:30
It’s free You don’t have to download any extra software
01:34
And works for both windows and Mac
01:35
Now, this is cool.
01:36
But do you know what’s awesome.
01:40
Well, It also works with other languages than English
01:43
For instance
01:44
Agar me hindi me bolunga, Tub bhi ye kaam karenga.
01:47
Although, to be hones, it’s still not 100% accurate
01:51
But if you speak clearly, you can easily 80-90% accuracy
01:53
And then, you have to spend a minute or two to give
01:57
finally touch.
01:58
---- Ok mrinal so what’s trick?
01:59
Well, Like always, Google has lot of tricks hidden in it selves
02:02
And one of those is the voice feature in Google drive.
02:06
Its default function is --
02:07
You speak And google will convert that into text
02:10
But if you try that, Most of your word will lost due to background
02:15
noise And you won’t get accuracy
02:17
But, what if it’s listening directly from the videos
02:19
I.e. the output of your computer becomes the input for Google voice to text
02:23
Sounds interesting.
02:24
So, let’s see how to do it.
02:26
MacOS This time, let’s start with Mac first.
02:29
Most system don’t let you record your computer audio
02:33
Maybe that's because of piracy or something
02:35
So, you will have to download a third party software called soundflower
02:39
The steps are simple
02:42
Open any browser And download soundflower
02:44
I’ll post the link in the description
02:47
Then unzip it and install it on your computer
02:49
Next, you need to tell MacOS To use the output audio as input
02:57
So go to sound settings And set soundflower 2ch on both input and
03:01
output
03:02
If are wondering what this 64 ch is for?
03:04
Well, I don’t know either But, what I do know is it won’t work with
03:09
this. So stick with 2ch.
03:11
On output and input
03:12
Now, fire up Google chrome ( and yes, it only works in chrome)
03:17
Open Google docs
03:19
Create a new document
03:20
Tools > Voice typing
03:23
In another tab, open youTube and play any video
03:29
Now come back to Google drive Select your accent
03:32
And there start recording
03:34
And there you go.
03:36
Like I said, It also works with other languages
03:47
So, let’s try hindi
03:57
However, if you try this song It doesn’t work that well
04:03
Because of background music
04:04
But if the song has no or little music Than it works well.
04:08
Windows
04:09
Now, let’s try this on windows
04:12
Go to your windows sound settings And select recording device
04:16
And there you should see stereo mix If you don’t right click and turn on
04:24
Show disable devices
04:26
And then st Stereo mix, as default.
04:28
Now, let’s check it.
04:29
Open Chrome And create a new document
04:30
Play a video > and start recording .
04:32
Pretty cool right?
04:34
However, if stereo mix is not supported by your audio driver
04:39
And these days, it’s hard to find this option
04:42
You can check out my other video,
04:44
Tough, I’ve tested this with that method So, I’m not sure how this is going to play.
04:48
but, If you have a friend with mac
04:50
You can always Borrow it from him (buy them couple of drinks)
04:54
Add caption to all your video at once.
04:57
It’s worth it.
04:59
----
05:00
So, this video is inspired from the comments I got yesterday
05:02
If you want me to reveal all my little known practice on youtube
05:07
Just let me know
05:09
500 likes and I’ll do it in my next video.
05:11
So, that's pretty much it I’ll see you in the next one
05:13
And like always Thanks for watching.
