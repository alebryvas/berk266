hello everyone and welcome to another

video in this tutorial I will show you

how to get a transcript of a YouTube

video so if you want to get a text from

our YouTube video I will show you how to

do that so first go ahead and select and

open your desired video that you want to

get the text from just not that this

method is only working for the videos

that have closed captioning so to get a

text from a video the video should have

this CC icon if it doesn't have these CC

icons or does mean this method it won't

work so when you select a video and it

does have these closed captions haikon

go ahead and click on more

and then click on transcripts

here you will see all the text from the

video so you will see the text and the

timing of the text

and then you can just copy the text and

paste it so no text document file
