after you 've done at least six to twelve rounds of sun salutation in sivananda yoga we start on the main practice .we will begin with leg raises .it really helps open up the core , strengthen the core , and it 's just a wonderful way to start .so i 'm going to have lauren here lay down on her back .beautiful .now bring your arms down to your sides , palms on the earth .if you need any little assistance in this , because it is a lot of core work through here , you can place the hands underneath the hips if you need just a little bit of assistance .when i ask lauren here to engage the feet , nice deep flexion of the feet .pressing through the heels , toes to the nose .and we 're going to start with single leg. [CLS] [SEP]raises , and we 're going to have you do three of each , on each side .starting very slowly , inhaling up the right leg .about five seconds , slowly coming up .exhaling five , four , three , two , one .inhaling up right , five , four , three , two , one .lowering down slowly , five , four , three , two , one .
a hook spotter cause some of this wood is kind of hard , kind of hard , kind of hard .no hook on my potential piece. [CLS] [SEP]but we are going to get one on there sooner than later .we have to think about how that is going to hang , right about there .okay ,okay. [CLS] [SEP]and it needs another wire on it. [CLS] [SEP]and we need another little wire to put up , you can hang on your wall .make a nice little circle inside my screw eye .okay , now it is ready to be hung , now it is ready to be hung .
now hand washing is actually one of the best ways to prevent catching a cold .the germs that you would catch , travel through your hands onto other parts of your body , specifically your face .most colds come from direct contact that you 're having with somebody else who has the virus .often times that 's like shaking hands with somebody , being in close quarters , hugging , touching ,anything when you 're close with somebody else , sharing things , touching the same glass , touching the same silverware , touching the same food , stuff like that .so what you should do is constantly be washing your hands , especially if you 're traveling or if you 're in close quarters with people or you 're exposed to someone who might be sick .always be washing your hands and do it with warm water and soap , wash vigorously for at least 20 seconds to make sure you loosen up all the germs .now , you wo n't always have access to warm water and soap , so what you should do is carry hand sanitizer .i always keep some hand sanitizer with me , in my car , in a bag with me if i 'm traveling. [CLS] [SEP]and this is something you can take out whenever you need to and just put a little bit of on your hands .if you 're shaking hands with people at a public event , you do n't know who is sick or who is shaking hands with someone else who is sick .it 's really not worth getting sick , so use some hand sanitizer .the important thing to remember is that hands are a vessel through which germs can reach your body , so always keep your hands as frequently as possible .also , always wash your hands before eating and before touching your face .
the other way we can do cucumbers which is also very nice is on these pickling cucumbers i find out that works out the best because they are firmer is to slice them diagonally .same thing about 1/8 '' to 1/4 ''you can cut them a little bit thicker if were going to use this style because well you 'll see why what were going to do once we 're doing this .turn them on the side we 're going to cut them into strips and that ones are pickled. [CLS] [SEP]it 's going to make them nice soft and flexible but still have the good crunch .be careful not to cut your fingers because you ca n't enjoy your meal if your fingers are missing , same thing with the ends .we 're going to bring our bowl over. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm just going to mix them all together because as you see the process is the same no matter how you cut your cucumbers .
and i 'm going to talk about putting photographic emulsion onto watercolor paper .now photographs have an emulsion on them .and what i can do , is i can heat up this emulsion and light , tight space , using a red photographic safe light .and i can paint this photographic emulsion onto watercolor paper .and then i can print using traditional photographic techniques in a dark room .and i like this especially because i can make photographs that are n't necessarily just flat on plastic .i can put them on watercolor paper , i can make cards out of them , i can make even really beautiful painterly-esque images .and so that is one way that i can kind of create a style for myself using photographic emulsion that i 've painted onto watercolor paper .
in this episode , we 're actually going to use an interesting technique that combines bleeding acupuncture along with cuppings , very commonly used for heat syndromes as well as for pain .so this is a great choice for back pain .once again , we 're going to swab the area to make sure that it 's sterile .in this case , we use a lancet which is very similar to a diabetic 's use if they 're checking their blood sugar .and now , we utilize the cup again in the same fashion and we 'll place that over the location. [CLS] [SEP]we 're. [CLS] [SEP]we just use the bleeding needle .and you maybe able to see from the camera. [CLS] [SEP]we 're starting to get a drop of blood that 's starting to come forward , and if we leave on here for a few minutes , that amount of blood will start to increase .we 'll give that a moment to do some of its work .here we go .we 're actually starting to get a little bit of a drip from there which is good .and actually , in order to be therapeutic , we oftentimes , we 'll leave this on for five minutes and get about a teaspoon or so of blood out of it .but in this case , for the magic of tv , we 'll go ahead and leave it there not quite so long , and what you 'll see is when i release the pressure from this cup , the blood actually kinda sprays up on the cup , cups .so if you 're screamish you might want to go ahead and not watch the video right now .ahh , we did n't have too much from that .so , you can see that we have a little bit of blood there. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll go ahead and just clean that up and a little bit of bruising that 's left over from that .and that 's bleeding , cupping. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's quite effective for pain .
alright , some of the terminology is balls and strikes , and we call two balls and one strike ,of course everyone knows you only get three strikes .four balls , you take your base , hit by a pitch , take your base .now you 'll see me , it has a clicker in it , this is an indicator .as you can see , the game ended 1-1 count , and there was 2 outs .now , let 's say the game went on .watch this -there 's ball two , strike two .ball three , we call that a full count .ball four , take your base .go back to zero , start all over again .make sure you reset your indicator after every batter , because otherwise you could start with 4-0 , that does n't work .reset it 0-0.see that 0-0 ?ball 1 , strike 1 , strike 2 , strike 3. [CLS] [SEP]- you 're out of there !
laptop video cards are not upgradeable and another thing about them is you could always look at what kind you have by going to start control panel system. [CLS] [SEP]and then you go to hardware and device manager .right here the forth option from the top forth or fifth it depends on your computer .you will click it and right there it says what kind you have .in my case i got a at radiant 200 series .so one thing to know about laptop video cards is there are different kinds for a simple .i 'm looking right now this dell system and if you are planning to doing any kind of gaming on the laptop you are really not going to find a laptop with a video card cable to play like high in games .for under a 1000 dollars actually about 11 or 12 maybe even 13. [CLS] [SEP]but , in this case this dell i have a if you where going to buy you have a couple of options intel graphite meaning accelerator in 950 which is good enough for some games and mostly intended for emails and stuff like that , typing letters ,what not .then they have this second option on this dell laptop which is 128 mega mobility s1300 which that would play some games. [CLS] [SEP]and they have the 256 mega radian x1400 that would also play some games .with these cards the last two you will be able to play games but not with the first .the first one would play some games but not most of them .they have another manufacture. [CLS] [SEP]right here it is called cyber power not only ati radian are not the only ones that make video cards but also nvidia in this case of these cyber power where is it cyber power it comes with it .there it is .it comes with a mgva force 7600 256 mega which is better. [CLS] [SEP]then the dell. [CLS] [SEP]but , also it is 1200 dollars .so if you are planning on playing any kind high in games on it. [CLS] [SEP]and you have a lot that you pay like 700 dollars for it. [CLS] [SEP]there is not going to play games .another thing like. [CLS] [SEP]i said the video card on the laptop is not upgradeable the only kind that there is one kind of laptop that you could upgrade the video is called mxm module if your laptop has that .the module basically looks like a super nintendo cartilage you just pop it out and pop a new one in. [CLS] [SEP]but it was not very popular and has gone out of circulation .
cause i have a child that like to poke things down in it .okay .well do you think the damage is ?well a standard tuning is going to be $ 95 , the rest of it would depend with what is going on .pulling things out is not expensive pulling things out are free and sometimes you really find some really interesting things .but we could get to that point. [CLS] [SEP]take a look at what is going on .sounds good .the first thing i 'm going to do is pull the this desk off and if you want to grab that plant .sure .and we find out why certain things are they are .this piano is about 5 foot 7 , it looks to me to be from the 20 's from both designed in the cabinet and the appearance of the sound board and some other things that are going on here .it has not had any specific work , i can tell that by the pins they are still manufacture height .
so to position the feet as our foundation , always want to start with the feet in the standing poses .from foundations build strong houses. [CLS] [SEP]so you want your feet to be about the length of one of your legs spaced apart. [CLS] [SEP]so you can always use a yoga tie in the beginning or bathrobe belt or a regular belt or a necktie to measure the length from the outside of your , of the outside of your leg from your outer foot up to your hip .place that on your yoga mat to determine the width between your feet. [CLS] [SEP]and then you want to make sure that your feet are what we call parallel to each other .you can often use the second toes to determine that- make the second toes parallel to each other and press firmly down into your feet to begin creating a firm foundation for your standing posture , in this case , virasana 1 , hero 1.after awhile you 'll be able to tell the distance apart that you need your feet to be , but in the beginning , this is a good tool .
we 're going to let this cook well until our butter has just about melted down .and then we 're just going to dump it straight into our pan. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm just going to put this in the oven for about five minutes or so .now while we 're waiting for that we 'll take our same pan and give this a little wash out .we 're going to measure out one cup of water. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to add two cubes of our vegetable bouillon .we 're going to be using the stock with our chicken .so if you ca n't find vegetable bouillon , then chicken will be fine as well .and while we 're waiting for this we 'll start working on our asparagus .we 'll fill our pan about half way up with water and we 'll add just about a tablespoon , a little less than a tablespoon of salt , turn our front burner up to eight .and then will take our sauté pan as we 're getting ready to prepare our chicken and we 'll add a tablespoon of oil .
okay. [CLS] [SEP]other equipment that is usually used on your bows whether it would be long bow , recurve or your compound is string .there 's a ton of different strings out there in the market .you have what 's called dacron , the dacron is used for basically for recurve or longbows .you have what is called a fast flight , fast flight is normally used on compound .they are made in different lengths according to this style of compound. [CLS] [SEP]you have whether it would be 35 inch axle-axle or 40 inch axle-axle .your string is very important part when you shoot archery .one of the other things that we have here is some of your tools we have what is a called a allenwrench this is very important to have especially if you are working on your equipment .
the drink we are about to make is called a bat bite. [CLS] [SEP]so do n't worry you are not going to get rabies from this drink. [CLS] [SEP]but if you really do get bit by a bat then i would suggest doing something about it. [CLS] [SEP], do n't just go order a bat bite .we are going to do two shots of spiced rum. [CLS] [SEP], there 's one and two and follow that up with some cranberry juice. [CLS] [SEP]and you are going to do about a shot of cranberry juice. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll mix these two ingredients all together .all nice and your favorite winged creature can pack a nice bite as a drink as well .so let 's go ahead and pour that in and. [CLS] [SEP]the last thing we 'll do is just give it a nice splash of grenadine because you know the teeth came in and they 're going to give it a nice bloody effect and that 's a bat bite , bottoms up .
pose 11 in the sivananda series is utanasana , standing forward fold , and sue 's going to demonstrate for us .so i 'm going to have you standing facing this way .start into dasana pose .it 's basically stacking one part of the body onto the next , so go through the steps .bring your toes a little bit closer together than the heels .wonderful , strong thighs .engage those thighs .tuck the tail bone , hollow the belly and relax the shoulders back down , away .yes , gently drop the chin .you want the chin kind of parallel to the ground , the crown of the head reaching for the ceiling .alright , coming into the forward fold , arms to the sides , inhaling up .as you exhale , swan dive forward fold .she is bending from the hips , beautiful .the first thing i 'm going to have you do is grab a hold of either side of the elbow .using the weight of her arms and the weight of her head to really start that good stretch .now in this pose you 're getting a nice lower back stretch , you 're also stretching your hamstrings .so holding this just a little bit in the beginning .do you feel the stretch in the back of the legs ?yes .nice .gently release the elbow .now taking your hands beside your feet you 're going to lower back just a little bit , and please feel free to micro bend the knees if you need to .beautiful .the crown of the head just completely towards the mat , relax the neck completely , and coming out of it very slowly .inhale , reverse swan dive all the way up , take a nice back bend to counteract the fold .inhale up , straight spine , exhale , heart center .
in this clip we 'll talk about afternoon tea .another sport of tea dear .but of course , thank you .i 'll also take some of the sweets please .oh excellent .what is the story with these tiny little sandwiches and cakes ?it all started with lady bedford .in the 1800s lady bedford , usually right in the afternoon around four or five o'clock , would get these hunger pains because the time between lunch and dinner was just too long .in those days lunch was typically served at eight o'clock. [CLS] [SEP]so she was wondering how she could tide herself over to dinnertime .one afternoon she asked her servant to prepare a light sandwich with her cup of tea. [CLS] [SEP]and she took it in the boudoir .well , not only did it help her to bridge the time between lunch and dinner , but she also thought it was a nice little break , and before long she invited some of her friends to share in this ritual and the rest , as they say , is history because it did n't take much longer before more and more friends came together , and what started as just a sandwich and a cup of tea became a tradition that is now well known and practiced all over the world .so high tea is really just taking afternoon tea to the next level right ?well , that 's where you 're mistaken because high tea is really a misnomer. [CLS] [SEP]or it 's really misinterpreted .high tea is what the working class people had .high tea was when the factory worker came home after a day of work and sat at a kitchen table , which was usually a high table , having pot roast and a good pot of tea .now what you are referring to is the low tea because low tea , as lady bedford had it and her friends , was served on low tables in a boudoir , nice china , sweets and tiny little sandwiches .
there 's so many funny moments as a music producer. [CLS] [SEP], you know , it 's a lot of fun being in the studio .you know , it 's just a good vibe. [CLS] [SEP]you 're making music , you 're hanging out .you know , sometimes people drink , sometime people smoke ,sometimes people just chill out .so basically it 's , you know , a good energy environment .you want to always make sure that your studio has a good energy in it this is very important that makes the music better .there 's so many funny things that happen in a studio you 've got to understand that these artist they 're characters , you know , they 're artists for a reason .so , you know , artist are going to come in here. [CLS] [SEP]he 's going to be drunk , acting silly in the booth , making jokes , cracking jokes. [CLS] [SEP], everybody 's just having a good time , you know .so basically something funny happens just about every time we have a session here .alright. [CLS] [SEP]so actually this is a pretty recent story , a woman called me on the phone. [CLS] [SEP]she said my daughter wants to sing , we want to come in there , we want to buy a beat .i said. [CLS] [SEP]o.k great , you know .had them came in to the studio. [CLS] [SEP], the sat the whole time she was saying. [CLS] [SEP]oh , you know , she 's really great , she like a mixture between whitney houston and rihanna , you know , just really amazing .so i said o.k . [CLS] [SEP]cool. [CLS] [SEP], you know , let 's , let 's hear what you 've got .the girl was a little bit shy. [CLS] [SEP]so finally , you know , i talked them in to getting in the booth and needless to say she needed a lot of work .you know , this is something that happens , you know. [CLS] [SEP], it 's funny. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's also a little bit , you know , disturbing .but what are you going to do , you know .you 've got to understand that these artists sometime they 're in their own head , they 're in their own bubble and it 's a music producers job to give them a little bit of the reality that we do live in and you really do have to put in a lot of work to be a talented artist .
so if we 're going to play a basic drum beat in 6/8 , that would be the paradiddle diddle .the problem is when your playing a drum fill , typically , as there 's exceptions to every rule , but you do n't go backwards around the drums meaning you do n't start with a lower drum , the lower pitched drum , and do a drum fill going up .has it been done ?yes .will it be done in the future ?yes .do people do it today ?yes .it 's just an unnatural thing for a couple of reasons .one , the pitch , and secondly , your body is not used to going this way around the drum kit .okay , it goes this way around the drum kit , it 's more efficient .so the paradiddle diddle does n't make sense in that way .yeah. [CLS] [SEP]that 's helping us out. [CLS] [SEP]but we are playing kind of a weird fill .this is where the double paradiddle , it would come into place .right ?so that is why the paradiddle diddle does n't work within a beat concept .if your playing a drum solo , absolutely !you speed them up and it sounds great , but , this does n't work really with a drum fill .but let 's go ahead and take a look at what 's coming up next .
in this segment , we 're going to talk about the diminished triad , the diminished 7th , the difference between a diminished 7th and a minor 7 flat 5.there is a little bit of a difference .i 'll also be showing you the functions. [CLS] [SEP][ sounds like ] around with these chords because they 're. [CLS] [SEP]kind of , they 're used little bit differently than the way you will like a major 7 or a dominant 7.a diminished 7th is one that uses a flat 3 and a flat 5 and a double flat 7.but we 'll get into all that in a little bit , but for now we 're just going to want to make sure that we focus on the triad. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'll show the different voicings that we have , the different inversions that we have for that .again , an inversion is where you flip a chord upside down and instead on the root , you 're going to start on the 3rd or the 5th or the 7th ,just the different note that 's not the root .but when we get started and we start talking about some diminished chords .let 's start with the diminished triads .
this is riley , and he is going to help me , today , to talk to you about children that may have growing pains , and how a message might be a beneficial way of helping them to release some of the aches and pains , and discomfort associated with growing pains .growing pains can typically affect children between the ages of three and five , and then again between of eight and twelve .but these are simply guidelines because it can affect a child anytime .it can be something that causes discomfort in different parts of their legs , in the fronts , the backs , some children may have ashcan slaughters , which could cause pain up in the knee area , other children may have ciphers which could cause some kind of discomfort in their ankle area , which is more of a inflammation of growth plates , but this message could still be helpful and beneficial to help alleviate some of those aches and pains .even children that run around and play , lots and lots , can get aches and pains in their legs and they may not exactly be growing pains , but these message strokes and techniques can be helpful even in those situations .so , hope that you 'll find the next bits of information useful .
and then we see that we have to redo that fin and that one also and this one too and this too .mainly , it was the fins .okay , sorry , fish .okay , now that we have mainly the fish shape , we have to try to separate it from the base because it sticks .that 's why we spread it across the -- in there .but for the shape that we have-that made eyes , i have better idea .okay , now it looks like --this goes lower .then we are going to make the fins pattern that always they have this kind of radius bones , and we can do it , of course , like this .but we 're going to do it better with a too , but. [CLS] [SEP]this -- it gives you an idea how the direction of the radius , okay ?
there really is a surprise in the center of the cupcake .my 2 favorite things to put together in this world are chocolate and peanut butter .in my book , that just means perfection right there .these cupcakes are chocolate cupcakes , which i have 2 secret ingredients in the cupcakes , in the cake parts themselves .they 're going to be so moist , you 'll want to eat them just by themselves .if you 're anything like me , that 's not normal , but trust me , they 're going to be fantastically moist cupcakes .there 's going to be a surprise in the center of that .we 're going to put in a peanut butter cup in the center of the cupcake for a little surprise when you bite into it .i know , it 's already sounding amazing .then on top , we 're going to have a very light whipped peanut butter frosting with just a little bit of chocolate in that too .ca n't go wrong with that .all over it 's great .every bite has great flavor , lots of chocolate and peanut butter in every single bite .this frosting is great by itself .the cupcakes are great by itself .i could just eat a million of the little reese 's peanut butter cups that are going in the center of them .fantastic cupcakes .let 's get started .
so the last material or supply that you 'll need to have is a workable fixative spray .you can purchase these at any art supply store as well as hardware stores. [CLS] [SEP]i have found them there .you want it to be a workable fixative , not a final fixative because you want the surface to continually be workable but the reason for this is that when you are going to work with adhesives on top of a surface that you have applied graphite or pencil to , you are going to notice that it is going to tend to wash away all of your graphite lines .so if you want to still have a guide to follow , if you are not just sort of freely working into a collage and you are actually working on a specific image. [CLS] [SEP], you want to spray your surface with a workable fixative in order to keep the graphite down .i would definitely make sure that the areas that you are collaging that you tend to darken with graphite before you spray the fixative .then just do a light application in order to keep the graphite on to the paper because you do n't want to lose your image as you are working .you are going to have to keep redrawing it in if not .
in a single straight leg stretch , take your right hand on the back of the right leg for the hamstring .and take your left hand down to that right ankle .it can be done in different levels , you can be up on your tail bone , you can come down your lower back .some people , if they have a problem where their neck bothers them , can lay the head down .push forward to connect deeper into the back and the abdominals , hold your head up .now take a deep breath in , and switch both legs over towards the left leg and you 're bringing that leg in straight towards you and then exhale , switch .and inhale , switch .inhale and exhale , use the breath .inhaling and exhaling .extending with the toes and again , if your neck bothers you , bring your head down .but it wo n't work as deeper into the back and abdominal muscles as it is when you lift the head up .and up back and forth .pointing like. [CLS] [SEP]somebody 's got you right by the toes. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're reaching .one more time .deep breath in and a deep breath out .and lay right down .
a-r-m-o-n-i-e n-a-t-i-o-n .com. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'd love to talk to you and hear any input that you might have and any help that you might need with your closets because it took me a long time to master this .so organizing your closet can be one of the most difficult and annoying tasks. [CLS] [SEP]there could be , ok ?i know there 's spring cleaning. [CLS] [SEP]but you have to get rid of the winter stuff when its summer and the summer stuff when its winter and i 'm going to teach you how to organize your closet where every day you open the door and its lovely to see .you pick out your outfit and you know that you 're ready to go .so we 're going to go from shoes to jackets to color coordination to everything you can imagine .i 'm even going to teach you a couple of tips that you probably do n't know .so let 's go into my closet and show you what you can do with yours .
in this clip we 're going to be covering goals for your play .now it 's helpful that during your writing process that you have an idea of what you 're ultimately going to do with the play .an important resource book you might want to take a look at is the writer 's market , which comes out once a year .it lists all sorts of companies that accept writing , from books to articles and they usually have a section on plays as well .and it will list theater companies and what types of plays they 're looking for .it may even list the maximum number of characters that they expect , and it will give contact information too , so it can be really valuable , even while you 're writing the play , to be investigating it and not wait until your play is totally finished .now another option is competitions and contests .maybe you 'll pick up a little cash if you win a contest , but the real value is in getting exposure for your work , getting people to see it .and often that can be a big boost into getting it produced if you 've had some winnings on that .now another option is to produce the play yourself .now the trick there is that promotion gets very very expensive , but if you know of a space or even a lot of schools or churches will have spaces or stages that they 'd be willing to rent you for your play .now promotion is very important and you might even want to start your own website if you do n't have one already , or create one specifically for your writing where a production company who gets your submission , or anyone you contact about your writing about doing a play on their venue , they can look up your website and see that you are a serious playwright .now i mentioned the writer 's market , but there are all kinds of books out there about writing , and what you might do is look for books in the specific area where you really feel you need the most boost .if you seem to have trouble creating characters or working on dialog or coming up with entire story , check out a book or a guide along those lines .also a guide on play form , even though you may know the basics , a guide may give you details. [CLS] [SEP]like , you put this period before the , within the parentheses , or after the parentheses , or whatever it might be , just so you can have you can grab real quickly .there 's so many writer 's discussion groups and forums on the web now that you 'd be able to really be specific and find a group that has playwrights who are writing very similar styles to what you 're writing , maybe live in the same region , maybe they 're the same age or demographic , people you can share your thoughts with and get ideas from .and that 's important to do , not when you finish the play , but it can be really helpful along the way during that journey .if you happen to be a teacher , writing scenes can be really valuable too .it can be a great learning experience for children , or even for people learning english as a second language .instead of reading , where you open the book and you 're reading with expression , you 're having students get up there and actually read a scene .so they do n't really know that they 're reading or pay attention to , 'ok , now i 'm going to be learning this reading ' , they 're concentrating on the character and the dialog and having fun , and it 's a great learning experience that 's a lot of fun. [CLS] [SEP]and it really holds their attention too .so we 've covered some points to be doing while you 're writing your play. [CLS] [SEP], now take that creative energy that you 've got while you 're writing and put that into the promotion and knowing where your play is going to be going .
i say first layer , because you can do two , three , or four layers of this combination if you want to .but this is the first layer of soundboard attached to the z channel .i 've attached , with screws , wherever there is not a stud .the idea is i do n't want to go through the soundboard into the stud. [CLS] [SEP], i want to miss all those studs .if i go into the stud , the sound is going to be transmitted through the soundboard directly into the stud , and that 's what we want to stay away from .we want to put all our screws in between the studs , here , here , and so forth , and that creates that springing motion that we really , really need especially for bass guitar , kick drum , and those really loud , low instruments .low sounds go through the walls more than high sounds .if you 've ever noticed , if you 're in another room and you hear somebody talking on the other side of the wall , it will usually , it will usually sound like a muffled sound because that 's the low sound of the person 's voice getting through the wall , but the high sound , the `` s 's '' do n't get through .this is a piece of sound board that i 've just broken up a little bit so you can see what it looks like inside .it 's pretty much just a composite material made of sawdust. [CLS] [SEP]and maybe some recycled newspaper in there , they just throw together a whole bunch of mixture of materials , and then they use a glue to meld it all together .you can get this in different thicknesses , i highly recommend getting the thickest that you can because , again , mass is what we 're looking for .so if you can afford to do it , i believe this comes up to 3/4 '' thick , maybe even an inch .so , get the thickest that your budget allows for the soundboard .
once you have the angles of the feet positioned , then just move the forward knee directly over the ankle and also make sure that the kneecap is directly above the second toe .you can kind of check this out from the side if you need to in the beginning , until you know where the , that position comes for you .this is bringing safety for the knee and aligning the shin bone so that it 's straight .yoga 's a lot about physics. [CLS] [SEP], you just want that knee right above the ankle , if it feels too much you can always bring it a little bit behind the ankle until you work into it over time and then gradually you can bring it forward more .but you never want to have the knee lunging past the ankle , always right over the ankle , right over the second toe .then you can come back to prayer position and begin to notice how that feels with your shoulders over your hips , noticing how your ankles feel , how your knees feel and in the next slot we 're going to talk about how you can position that better .
so after you 've established the border with your artist tape and taped your mat board down to your working surface , your next step is to choose your image for working with .so here again i have a few different types of images that you can work with .the reason that i 've chosen to xerox copy this is because working in a gray scale tracing is actually a little bit easier to define edges as well as differences in variation of color rather than dealing with so many different colors in one piece .so here is an image already call it a ready image that you want to work from .or , a drawing that maybe , perhaps you 've done on another paper that you 'd like to see turned into a collage .or a drawing that somebody else has done for you .whatever the case may be .you can trace it onto some velan or tracing paper and then transfer the image which i 'll be showing you just a little bit later onto your working surface .and then you also have the option of drawing directly onto the board itself , freehand drawing .depending on what type of work you 're looking to achieve .
next we need to rotate it in a counter clockwise fashion off of the vacuum adapter .you might need to wiggle that just a little bit to pull that off .next we need to invert the bag over a trash can and empty out all of our dust .now not all of it will come out. [CLS] [SEP]so you are going to have to depress that spring. [CLS] [SEP]and you can even tap on the bag to get a little bit more out of it .on our sander itself , there is dust inside of this vacuum adapter. [CLS] [SEP]so you want to make sure you empty that out as well .next we need to line your bag up and turn it clockwise .
that can be done .this is by application of stickers .let me show you a sheet of stickers .as you can see you can there are pieces that are round. [CLS] [SEP]there are pieces that are thin circle .and these you can use and cuts and use or in what ever way your like .simply cut a little piece out of it and put it in what ever piece of work that you 're doing which you want to embellish .anything that is appropriate .so just stick it. [CLS] [SEP]and then you put it through the same process of putting it in the furnace .keeping it at 700 or 8000 temperature .keeping it for 7-8 hrs. [CLS] [SEP]and then it cools .and then you take it out. [CLS] [SEP]and it is ready .this particular design which ever designed you have put has been transferred onto your particular piece .it really works wonders on this simple ordinary looking things and you use a sticker and it completely raises the level of that particular piece .the same stickers can be used to enhance the look of a sculpture .for instance if you look at this round piece .now if you cut and it into two .first the artist likes .you take this. [CLS] [SEP]and you put half of it on this wing. [CLS] [SEP]and you put it half of this on the other wing .and then well it has changed .it 's a bird. [CLS] [SEP]it becomes a bird with a floral wing on both sides .and you want to add some more color. [CLS] [SEP]may you can put a strip of red over here .or a strip of red in the beak .you can do lots of things other than using on glaze process .you can also , this is again a non glaze process .which you can use for embellishing your object .there is such a large scope .what a huge scope there is to do things and have really have fun .when you are working you do n't have to be very serious .you can play with this .you play with stickers .you play with color .play with designed and you 're thinking keeps changing as you wish .so i think that 's , that gives a lot of scope and variety to the artist at work .thank you. [CLS] [SEP]
how do you teach your children self defense ?i have a seven year old and a five year old and we 're dealing with this all the time .in schools there is typically a zero tolerance for striking , even if it 's in self defense. [CLS] [SEP]your child could get thrown out of school , suspended , or disciplined for striking .so , we want to make sure that we 're teaching our children how to protect themselves , but at the same time not getting in trouble and especially not really hurting the other kid .up until , probably high school , it gets more serious , but when we 're talking about elementary school age kids we 're talking mostly about school yard type tussles .we can help our children to avoid these things .number one. [CLS] [SEP]: we want to make sure that they understand this is self defense not self offense .they 're never initiating , they never take the roll of the bully .i want to help them understand the damage of teasing and make sure that they 're never participating in that .number two ; top of the list ; you have to have an attitude that nobody touches me without my permission .nobody touches me without my permission .we want to instill that sense of self worth into your children .so , mind set and mental attitude are really the driving forces behind good self defense training .in terms of actual physical techniques ; joining me is mr. [CLS] [SEP]joe mcnolley from pro star mixed martial arts .here is what i teach my kids .i could teach them how to knock the kid out with one blow , but what i want to do is help my child to get out of the situation as quick as possible .so , whenever he 's grabbed i teach him to ask himself two quick questions .one , just grab my shoulder please ; what targets are available to me .i 'm teaching my child what parts of the body are more sensitive .it 's interesting , if you look at your body the outside of the joint is typically a lot , is hard it can take punishment .the inside is usually pretty sensitive .that applies here to the shoulder too ,so one of the things that i tell my kids is if somebody grabs you. [CLS] [SEP]their arm pits are immediately open .just reach under there and pinch their arm pit .most kids will let go instantly .pinch the nipple , they 'll let go instantly .you 're not striking , you 're not hitting , you 're not really causing that much pain , but what i want this guy to experience is like he grabbed a hot pot. [CLS] [SEP]and he wants to let go real fast .it 's funny. [CLS] [SEP]i taught this to my child , alexander , and he just laughed .he had this kid who was picking on him .i said just reach under there and pinch him under the armpit .he goes no daddy. [CLS] [SEP]i 'll tickle him , he 'll let go , because he said ; that 's the kind of nature i want out of the child .i want him not to be interested in hurting people .i want him to be interested in protecting himself , because nobody touches him without his permission .so , the two questions i 'm going to ask ; what targets are available and then what weapons are available ? .typically your hands are free and your legs are free .so , that 's my ideas on teaching self defense to children .i 'm john graden .thank you very much .i hope that helps .
i 'm living in salt lake city .we 're going to talk about who lives at a certain address .there might be any number of reasons why you might want to know who is living at a certain address for either personal reasons or business reasons .one method to determine that is a reverse address look up on line .you type in the address. [CLS] [SEP]it 'll tell you who 's living there , the phone number possibly .another method would be to contact the county property assessor or check on line for maybe an index to the county assessor records , type in the address .it might list who is living at that address .a city directory , again a city directory or telephone book , again you 'll need to know the phone number probably to look that up .another method would be to pay a finders fee to a people finder service .and one of those is us search .there are others on the web where you pay a fee. [CLS] [SEP]and they 'll find whatever information you 're looking for .
you would use that for working on a package , for example .when i do a package which is a completely pre-produced story , i need to make sure that my voice part of that is properly recorded , and so you would come into an audio booth like this .you would have your script with you .your script will just be the information that you plan to read , and it 's already timed out because your story timing is very important .and you have to make it fit with the other sound bites in the story and the other elements of that story .so you would have your script .you would come into the audio booth , and this would be being recorded either in here or some other source , some other location .and i would read my script in a fashion that made sense that followed the script and sounded natural because no one 's going to see me in here doing this .it 's all going to be recorded on tape somewhere and without my picture , and it 's going to be -- then put into that story as just an audio file .so i will record the voice , and later on , i will put the video over top of that , and i will incorporate the sound bites .and i will then take all of that material , put it together into one complete and finished story .
you need to add red chili , this much will go .we need to add tumeric powder , say a little bit just for the taste , for the sake of adding it , and we need to add to , gel it well .as you can see that it has come in to a nice combination , is n't it .this is the actual stuffing which will go into the stuffed tomatoes .put the fennel seeds from the top .it has to be now a bigger quantity , gel it well and then add green chili to it .the green chili 's has to be in big quantity , like this much .basically we want to make a spicy , spicy recipe , add a little bit more .
we 're going to pour everything into the food processor and we 're going to start mixing it together until it would be nicely grounded .i do n't put all the oil together. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to add the rest of the oil a little bit later on the chickpeas. [CLS] [SEP]has to be very very soft to make this chumous salad. [CLS] [SEP]otherwise it 's not going to grind good .the grinding takes 2 to 3 minutes. [CLS] [SEP]you can see it 's nice and smooth. [CLS] [SEP]everything is mixed together , taste it to make sure you like the taste. [CLS] [SEP], you might think you need to add a little salt to it or more garlic if you like it spicier , but that 's how it should look .
ok , the first thing that we deal with in the yellow belt criteria , are attacks from behind .ushiro tekubi tori .ushiro means behind , tekubi is wrists that are held behind the back , basically .so , ushiro tekubi tori is two hands held behind the back .we do this two ways , statics to learn it , and then in motion .so in static , the first thing i tell people from this position is do n't let your person pull you back off balance .drop your center , bring your hands slightly forward .you 'll notice that i 'm standing in a stance , kanme , or hanme , my left foot is forward .i never stand with my legs like this because he can push me forward , or pull me back , it does n't really matter .one way or the other .so my left foot is forward .the first thing that i do for ushiro tekubi tori kokyunage , is i leave this hand down .this hand turns in front of me , notice i do n't try to raise my arm up , because i do n't have any strength this way .i rotate it in front of me .i follow the direction of my hand up , and i just pivot just like this .all i do now is step , and drop my arms .true , this looks a little goofy , and most people are not going to attack you like this on the street , but this teaches you some very good principles of learning to split the person 's energy .his mind can only really work in one way , one time .and with neko it probably works less than that .but , for a normal person , up and down , spread the person out , and cut them down .one more time .one , two , three .in motion , it looks like this .he moves around , i blend with him , up , down , and around .it 's very important to blend with this attack ; do n't become rigid and have him pull you off balance .relax .as he comes around , i step with him , then i turn and close the door , projecting him forward .one , two , three .
all you need is to wet it down in the sink .use your regular dishwashing detergent and sponge to gently clean it off .if you have something that is baked on like. [CLS] [SEP]we 've got this little piece right here .go ahead and use gentle scrubbing of it with your sponge .if you have an abrasive sponge , steel wool , you do not want to use anything that abrasive on your turn table or for most things that you 'll be cleaning .make sure it gets a good scrubbing both top and bottom .of course , be careful since this is glass .if you have anything that got down to the bottom of your microwave , then you might have some residue down around here where it collected .this one is fine .you 're just going to rinse it off and let it dry .the turn table is one of the easiest parts of the microwave to clean .even if you 're not getting your microwave cleaned as frequently as you should , at least getting the turn table clean on a regular basis will make your microwave seem much cleaner .this is also where the majority of spills should be taking place .if you have exploding food , of course , that 's going to go everywhere .anything which spills is probably going to be caught .you see it has a little lip around the edge here .that will help keep spills in check .we 're just going to let this dry putting it off to the side , and then we 'll be ready for the next step .
another variation of the butterfly is commonly known as the wave , although it is also referred to as many other names , depending on who you talk to .there 's also many variations of how this move is done , but basically it 's a low , version of the butterfly , back and forth , behind the body .so now we are entering in , the plain that is behind us as well , as in front of us .another way to do. [CLS] [SEP]it is , like this , behind the shoulders .so in order to understand how this move is done , as always , break it down to one side at a time .swinging the poi , in front and behind you .notice that the poi is moving in same direction , this way , behind me and in front of me .both sides , and then together , one at a time .my wrists , moves the poi behind me .
okay here 's the cha cha pattern on the drum set with accented eighths on the ride cymbal .okay let 's break this down a little bit .with the left hand we have a conga pattern , cross stick and then doubles on the toms coinciding .of course this starts on beat two , on beat one. [CLS] [SEP]we have the first bass drum .followed by also on the and of two , and notice in the second measure we just play on the and of two .and then just let 's add some accented eighths on the ride .
so lying in a supine position , which means face up , place the heels on top of the ball , and the arms could just rest gently to the side , i 'm going to be pushing down with my heels , driving my heels through the ball , as i extend the ball out and , particularly , when i pull the ball in .so if you can see , i 'm rolling from heel to toe .so the resistance is coming right now as i 'm pushing down. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm targeting the hamstrings right here .pulling the ball in , so that 'd be level one position .level two , we 're going to add a hip extension to the exercise , and then i lower .so as the heels come in , i lift the hips high , and then let the hips drop down .so we 're adding another muscle group to the exercise , hamstrings and glutes .level three would be to lift the hips before the action starts , so i 'm lifting , stabilizing , and then , rolling the ball in and pressing out .it takes a little while to build the strength to get here. [CLS] [SEP]so take it one step at a time , and then , if you want the super challenge for the hamstring , lift , extend one leg up , and roll the ball in .again , you will not have to do many repetitions till you feel the fatigue in the hamstrings .
certain things you should remember is having a flashlight nearby your bed because when smoke happens , it could be really dark .as any electronic device , you should always check that the batteries work annually or maybe semi-annually .another thing that you should keep in mind is the seriousness of a fire .maybe you should have the time to talk to your children about how feeling fire is a very serious matter and should only be done in serious cases as a true emergency .other things to keep in mind is to alert the household members would be whistles or other such powerful devices so that everybody can wake up if they were sleeping during this time of need .remember that fires are a very serious matter and your children should be able to take care of themselves as well as to alert everybody in the household .children should not be relying on just the parents but should be able to visit the building on their own and alert everybody in the household just as well as any other adult .
and today we are shooting here from mckay 's hedge row .we are standing in front of the american fort right now .we are going to talk about paintball fields and size and some of the things you need to have a good paintball field .you need a good safe area where people can go and take their masks off , look at their guns and make sure everything is working right , cool down , eating a snack , access to water is always good and if not bring coolers of water .you do n't need anyone getting sick .we have two separate safe areas .we have the first safe area which we park our vehicles in and the second safe area is more of a staging area once we decide what kind of game we are going to play .we come out in to that area and if you get out you go back to the safe area and wait for everybody else .it is always good to let your neighbors know what you are doing. [CLS] [SEP]so they wo n't call the cops on you .you need to know that your field is large enough so that no stray paintballs are going to enter in anyone 's direction that is not playing the game .i recommend do n't play in the cities unless it is a sanctioned field .this piece of property is about twelve and a half acres and it has two good size , two story forts on it .work with. [CLS] [SEP]what you 've got. [CLS] [SEP]i mean this place did n't really have a whole lot going for it when we first started but through the hard work of many people who love the game you see stuff like. [CLS] [SEP]this popping up all the time. [CLS] [SEP]so a good size field always helps .a wooded area , we like playing in the woods ball and scenario and if that is not your thing you can play inflatable bunkers and play in a nice back lot but well moved .whatever you do keep it safe , know your guns if you are not going to play a normal field , keep your guns under 300 feet per second .always require masks on the field .a good thing to keep you covered is liability forms .you can talk to a lawyer and get some simple liability forms drawn out and keep everybody out of trouble .
a trouser pant is a nice slim fitting jean .these are denim , you may not be able to see that. [CLS] [SEP]but they 're a denim jean. [CLS] [SEP], they 're long and they 're slim .these are not the skinny jean. [CLS] [SEP]but this is a work appropriate pant that you can dress up or down and it 's tapered but not skinny .the pointy shoe looks the best , again because anytime your eye follows a vertical line down to a `` v ''it adds height , so that 's what works best with this type of pant .although many petites do n't think that they can wear the skinny pant , you can .the key to wearing the skinny jean or the skinny tapered jean is to wear height , it 's absolutely necessary to have a heel that is thin with a pointy front , not a round toe because round adds pounds .so yes you can wear the skinny jeans , but make sure you wear it with height and a little point .
we left off at high pat on horse .we 're going to move onto a series of kicks .one of my favorite moves is strike tiger 's ears .we pivot , kick left .then , the move is called creep low like snake to golden wrist , stands on one leg .we do it on the other side , to fair lady work shadows. [CLS] [SEP]right , fair lady work shadows left , push needle to sea bottom , fan through the back , deflect hairy and punch , and then we finish with the closing of tai chi .that is the end of 24 yang style tai chi .
the actions are always open , always open .now when carrying a shotgun in and around a shotgun range , what we suggest is that you can take your arm , put it right up underneath , and carry the shotgun like this .but as you see , you have absolute control of that muzzle , always have control ; you can see where it is .one of the other things that you can do , if this is not comfortable for you , you can actually take and drop it over your shoulder and now you can grab the muzzle or up here at the forearm. [CLS] [SEP]and you can carry it , but. [CLS] [SEP]you have absolute control of the muzzle .one of the things that you do n't want to do , and you 'll see people sometimes they 'll take a shotgun. [CLS] [SEP]and they 're out in the field and their hunting it , but you have no control of the muzzle .you do n't know where that muzzle is going to be pointed .you do n't want to see , and people on the skeet field for obvious safety reasons , do n't want to see the muzzle not under control .this is an automatic , or a semi-automatic shotgun that 's used a lot in skeet shooting .so again , always have control of the shotgun .you can carry it like so. [CLS] [SEP], you can carry it balanced under the arm , you can carry it over the shoulder , but always have control of the muzzle .another common shotgun that is used in skeet shooting is the over and under .and when you 're carrying an over and under on a skeet field , the thing that you want to do is always make sure that it is broken open .and again , you can carry it much like the other one , like so ; you have absolute control of the muzzle .you can drape it over the shoulder like so where you have absolute control over the muzzle .one of the things that you never want to see on a fixed action shotgun like this is the action closed .if you 're walking around like this , nobody knows that it 's unloaded .it 's very , very dangerous .even the handler , a lot of times , does n't even know that it 's unloaded .so it always must be broken open , again .and when you carry an over and under shotgun , always have control of the muzzle end of the shotgun , not like so , not with the barrels over the shoulder. [CLS] [SEP]like so , you do n't have control .always have control of the muzzle of the shotgun .
if your cat has been having some soft stool or diarrhea , you 'd want to collect that portion of the feces for your veterinarian to take. [CLS] [SEP]and you just collect about that much on the spoon , half a teaspoon or so is probably plenty .if your cat has normal stool , then you would just kind of take an end of it , and you can get it in a zip lock bag , just any clean zip log bag will do , you can dump the whole thing in there if you like , because if you do n't want to touch it .seal it up , and then bring it to your veterinary office in less than 24 hours so that they can check the feces under the microscope for any parasites .
the next thing is drinking a lot of water .my personal belief with what i 've studied is that most of the drinks that we are drinking on a daily basis are actually dehydrating us and we 're drinking them instead of water .so there 's things you can do in your company in your corporate headquarters such as having water coolers , bottled water , whatever .and it needs to be water without chlorine by the way because these chemicals are part of the major problem with health .but water is the thing that god really gave us to flush the system .and our cells need to be hydrated and if they 're not hydrated what happens. [CLS] [SEP]is the body starts pulling the water out of the cells .a lot of the times the migraine headaches that your employees are getting is simply because they 're getting way to much caffeine or too much sugar which is dehydrating them. [CLS] [SEP]and they 're not drinking nearly enough water .you 're talking pretty much sixty four ounces of water a day .so how are you doing on that mr. [CLS] [SEP]chief executive ?are you setting an example by drinking five , ten cups of coffee a day or are you actually. [CLS] [SEP], do you have your water bottle and you 're demonstrating something .we try to work with you to install the things that are going to make the difference .
in this clip , we 're going to be talking about multi-point systems .now , in some indoor leagues , they have more than just the three red lines .they 'll have like an extra rim , which is pretty similar to maybe a three point line in basketball .so it 's going to be further away from the goal and much harder to score .but they 'll award you possibly an extra goal for scoring from out there .also to remember that if you are playing coed , that some places will determine that a girl 's goal will be worth two goals and a guy 's goal will be only worth one .so remember to keep your female players up front and towards the opponent 's goal .because their goals will be worth more and if you can put your females in scoring position , the odds are , you 'll probably win the game .in this clip , we 're going to be talking about accessories .now , some indoor facilities do n't really regulate what you 're allowed to wear and what you 're not allowed to wear .but , it 's highly recommended that you do n't wear any form of jewelry , whether it is wrist bracelets , ear rings , necklaces .because those could be tugged on or grabbed during the game and could cause harm to someone else or yourself .now , say that you have an injury that requires a cast , or a sling , or some sort of support .a lot of times people will not let you play with a cast unless there is foam covering over the cast. [CLS] [SEP]so it does n't hurt anybody if they are hit by it .also , the same applies for braces and whatnot .they just want to make sure that its soft all around the edges. [CLS] [SEP]and there 's no metal sticking out , because it does n't feel very good getting hit by metal if you 're running to a soccer ball the same time somebody else is and you run onto each other .so , again a lot of places do n't regulate it , but to be safe you want to make sure. [CLS] [SEP]all those hard plastic , metal things are covered .you want to make sure all the jewelry comes off .
hi , i 'm emily larew .we 're continuing on with our tap combination for beginners .we 're going to start with counts one through four .so we just did our heel , bow ,whack , we can up down , we 're going to stomp on our left foot towards the wall .alright , in our direction .so , if we 're facing the audience , it will be stage right , so we 're going to stomp towards stage right .and eight , you 're going to stomp .one , you 're going to scuff , and half step , hop , step .so good , try that again .we have stomp , scuff , hop , step .and as you can tell , i 'm making sure every one of my sounds even the hop , is clear , alright .seven and eight , we have one , and two , and what you 're going to do is take that left foot. [CLS] [SEP], you 're going to scrape on the inside of the tap , outside of the tap , stomp it down ,alright .so when i flopped it , my ankle gives a little flop , my right leg is bent , my left leg is straight .so i 'm going to go in , out , stomp .good .and i just want you to swivel your arms left , right , hah ,alright .good , so put that together .seven and eight , we have one , and two , and three , and four .good , one more time .six , seven , eight , one , and two , and three , and four .good , from the top .six , seven , and one , two , three , four , five , six , and seven , and eight .a one , and two , and three , and four , five , six , seven , and eight .one and two , and three , and four , and five , six , seven , and eight .one , and two , and three , and four .good .that was the very next part of your beginning tap combination .
in the next clip , let 's look and see how we start to move the arms curving space correctly .we 're starting with the spanish fifth position , with the arms turn back a little bit more in an exaggerated style , keep your tail bone tucked under , keep your shoulders back and down .take the right arm and very slowly start to move the arm down to what i call spanish second position .notice that my elbow is sticking it , and that the elbow is higher than the wrist , and the wrist is higher than my fingers .as i carved through the space , i come down to the first position , i keep the elbow sticking out so that as i start to return to fifth , i let the upper arm lead , the elbow sticking out and the last part of the arm to con-finish the movement would be the fingers .i can repeat this on the left side , bringing the arm down , down , down and up .
 , feel like they 're special .to start off with , give each birthday guest a name tag and have them write something creative about them on the name tag .so maybe that can start off a conversation .then when all the birthday guest arrive , have them introduce themselves and tell how they know the special person 's day .that can start another conversation as well .then you always want to be aware during games , especially for younger ones , some birthday guest may tend to get a little sad or feel like they 're not included , so always keep your eyes open for birthday guest who feel like they been left out .then before each person leaves , you want to make sure they have some type of party favor or gift to take home with them .keep in mind , you want everyone to feel special , almost like it 's kind of their day too and always have fun .
so you just want to fill it up just to how much you 're gon na use it that day .secondly , you want to make sure that your grinds are fine , but still have a bit of coarseness to them .now to set your grind , there 's usually a lever on the side of the grinder you can adjust .the last part is that you have to make sure that you fill up your porta filter above the rim .as you see , i have a little mountain here .the next thing you want to do is get rid of some of the grinds and. [CLS] [SEP]a lot of people use their fingers , but i like to use the lid .go straight across .make sure there 's no extra coffee that can go plug your espresso machine .and now we 're ready for tapping .
emil lamprecht :the next trick. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to show you is called `` splits . [CLS] [SEP]''now , this is something that comes from having practiced columns .it is very important to get good at columns before you do this , especially good at switching columns like so .now , `` splits '' is literally splitting the pattern in half .what you 're going to be doing is throwing two balls on one side , switching , and throwing two balls on this side .the best way to get into this is , is from a columns pattern like so , and then to throw them in the sides like that .for some performers , this is a favorite for a club trick , but it is much easier to learn the club version if you can get the ball version down .it takes a lot of practice and i personally still have trouble with this trick , but it is vey effective and very visual .eventually , if you want to get really fancy and can control the splits very well , you could even cross them on each side. [CLS] [SEP]so you 're holding two separate crossing patterns .good luck .
get your stance .make sure there 's nothing behind you , we do n't want to be stepping into anything .we step back , and down , and forward .this one involves a bit more of a push off the back leg to come back into position .all the other rules for lunges apply .we want our feet like this , we do n't want them on one track. [CLS] [SEP]or you 'll lose your balance .again , at the bottom body straight up and down , shins vertical , thighs vertical .this really , actually , gives you a nice quadriceps step if you do them right .one of the major benefits of the 'rear lunge ' is it does n't put as much stress on the front knee as lunges to the front. [CLS] [SEP]do .when you go to a front lunge and you do this , your front leg has to stop you which means that there 's more pressure in the knee .when you 're going to the back , all your front leg has to do. [CLS] [SEP]is just lower you down .so if you 've had knee problems or if your doctor tells you to watch it with your knees , you might want to try the rear lunge first with this warning .you 're doing lunges backwards when you 've never done them before .just take care in that manner .they 're a great exercise .try them out .
as a right handed person it would seem more easier for me now to throw the ball but as a left handed quarterback , it is a little more difficult just like it was for the right hand quarterback with the left leg down .so right now we are going to do the same thing .we are going to emphasize the trunk turn .turn trunk , throw .we 've got to turn , throw .there you go .when you get that ball , turn that trunk .throw .there you go .you 've got to make sure you emphasize on the turn the trunk .it is very very important .
okay , the first thing i 'm going to show you today. [CLS] [SEP]is how to make your own veil before we begin belly dancing .how to make your own veil is very simple .what you want to do is you want to go to the store , any fabric store , and you want a cut about 2 1/2 to 3 yards material .what you want to do is make sure you can get your arms at full extension. [CLS] [SEP]and then you want to have about 8 , 10 inches hanging from each arm. [CLS] [SEP], you want a little ever flow from each side .and that 'll be a proper length .each person has a little bit different length , depending on their length of their arms .so your veil should be able to hold behind you and still have a little bit ever drop down each side .should be between 2 1/2 and 3 yards .and then what you can do is when you 're home , when you get home , you can sew a little tiny hem around the whole entire veil to hem it off , so it does n't fray or anything like that .so on this one , we have a little tiny hem .and then to dress up your veil a little bit more , again with the same material , this is chiffon , you can also add on a hem .and with the hem , you can add on a fabric to finish , some kind of garnish that you want on to it , you can add some beading on to it , some ribbon , anything you want to do ,that , just dress it up just a little bit , maybe to match your costumes .another kind of veil you can buy is silk .silk almost completely different than chiffon .silk veil is very very fragile also .you 're only get a little bit of hem on this and silk is going to move much differently than chiffon .but that 's another example of veil that you can get .again , 2 1/2 to 3 yards of fabric and add anything to the trim that you like .
you 've got the cold on this side and the hot on this side and the way it works is that it seeps up against here and when this twists. [CLS] [SEP]it lets a certain amount ,i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]sorry , it goes this way .here 's the intake. [CLS] [SEP]so your valve sits this way and when this twists , you have a hot and cold on this. [CLS] [SEP]and it regulates the amount of each when it is turning .our problem right now is that these rubber o-rings are probably little bit worn just slightly and that is why you get a little bit of a drip .so when that happens , you 've got to replace the whole cartridge .so now some of the manufacturer 's make new o-rings and just replace this ring , this ring and these two rings .this manufacturer does n't so i had to go out and spend $ 20 for a new one instead of about 18 cents , oh well .
when selecting a telescope for astronomy , aperture is actually the most important feature , you want to consider .now , aperture , is a fancy word for the light gathering ability of your telescope .how much light it can soak up , how big your lens or your mirror may be , in this case .the light gathering ability of the telescope , is important , because that 's what makes those distant objects , seem a bit brighter , those dim fuzzies that we look for .you see further back in time , if you will , with a larger aperture telescope .the magnification that you 'll get with your telescope , will also depend on the aperture here , but typically seeing conditions permit that we use right about a hundred magnifications , or so , kind of a sweet spot for astronomy , and i say that though , even though a big scope like this , is capable of much more magnification , than the little guy i 've got right here .typically , my seeing conditions outside do n't allow me to do more than about , i 'm going to say , a hundred and twenty , a hundred and fifty magnification , with any of the instruments that i have here , and one of the reasons is , that our location here in anacortes , where it 's sea level .we 've got ten thousand feet of atmosphere to focus through , so. [CLS] [SEP]as i increase the magnification , i 'm increasing everything i 'm looking through , as well .plus the jet stream is above us , so no matter if i take out the bigger scopes , you 've seen here earlier , or one of these little guys here .maybe the eight or the ten .i 'm going to say about one twenty magnification , is going to be about the high end , and i 'll probably settle in right about eighty magnification , or so .as a rule of thumb , these telescopes , will give you fifty magnification per inch of aperture , but you really need ideal conditions , to do that kind of magnification .while these little guys here are ideal for lunar and planetary viewing , if you want to see deep sky objects , objects that are further out in our milky way galaxy , or even beyond the galaxy , a dobsonian such as this , of six inches of aperture or greater , is an ideal place to get started .you 'll see super nova .you 'll see globular clusters .the open clusters are beautiful through such a telescope , and you really need at least six inches , i feel , to start bringing in the deep sky objects .we 'll qualify that a little bit later , by talking about your seeing conditions , and what kind of area you view in , but typically , a six inch dobsonian , eight inch dobsonian , very cost effective , and very good for pulling in deep sky objects , and still portable , and easy to take in and out , as well .
chest , shoulders , and back with a strap .you want to choose a strap that is not stretching but is firm. [CLS] [SEP]and you just take that strap between your hands and lift the strap right up .when you hold on to that strap you are not pulling on the strap you just lightly hold it. [CLS] [SEP]so there is no stress on the hand or the shoulder .let the strap slide between the hands as you go right down behind you , reaching out with the hands .now control it with the breath breathing deep through your nose as you go all the way up .and if it touches the top of the head bring your hands closer together and then exhale and bring that right down in front of you .inhale deep through your nose as you reach straight up high and then exhale through your nose and reach all the way back behind you .inhale deep through your nose as you reach up high and exhale and bring that right down in front of you .controlling each move with the breath , inhaling and exhaling .now you are opening up chest muscles , arm muscles , shoulder muscles .bring it all the way up. [CLS] [SEP]and you are working back muscles and shoulder muscles , connecting back , shoulders , and chest , inhale deep and exhale release down .just feel the breath as you connect with your whole body , inhaling and exhaling and inhaling one more time. [CLS] [SEP]come all the way up , exhaling go all the way down and then inhaling returning back up and exhaling release down and just shake it right off .
i like to use kosher salt .you need a half teaspoon , about 1 to 2 pinches , of thyme .you can use fresh thyme if you want to , but right now we do n't have any around .about the same amount of oregano .maybe a little bit more .then half a teaspoon of black pepper .
you want to take some chicken wire , and you want to cut it about as wide as the opening of your rain stick .so you , you judge how many across that would be .use wire cutters or scissors and cut your chicken wire .once your chicken wire is cut , you have a strip of chicken wire , and you 're going to simply insert it into the tube .now , as it goes into the tube you may have to squeeze your tube to get it to fit .and you kind of want to twist it as it goes so that it will be spiraling inside of your tube and do a better job of filtering .sometimes you may have to bend the wire up or down .but it does n't matter because the whole idea is to have a filter that the , that the filler will filter through as it goes .you could also make another tube of this chicken wire if you wanted to so that you would have even more of a filter as you 're filling whatever it is goes through it .so you kind of have to play with it a little bit .make sure it 'll fit inside of your tube because you ca n't reach up in and pull it .so you insert your chicken wire in your tube .and if it 's , if it 's difficult you can also put a string or something on the end and stick it through so can help to pull it through if it gets stuck as it 's going through .once your chicken wire is in place all the way through , you 're going to want to look at that end .make sure that it is the way you want it to be coming through .and then you want to cap off one end .and then you 'll be ready to either fill it or decorate it before you put a cap on the other end .and that 's how you can use chicken wire as another kind of filter for your rain stick .
well now that we 've brought the kids back inside and we 're trying to warm them back up and give them a little bit of a treat , we are going to make something called maple snow taffy .in order to make maple snow taffy you have to heat up 100 % maple syrup .it has to be 100 % pure maple syrup .you 're going to heat that up basically slowly till it gets to the point to where it is boiling .as you can see that 's probably a good amount , i think we 're probably going to be making two different little servings of the snow taffy , so that should work nicely for it .as far as the brand , it does n't matter , you can use whatever brand you 'd like or if you have a particular favorite. [CLS] [SEP]but it does need to be 100 % maple syrup .okay , as you can see here. [CLS] [SEP]we 've got the maple syrup coming to a boil now .so it 's boiling pretty nicely , turn the stove off .we have transfer the snow from the baking try and put it into some bowls right here and the kids are wanting to watch this .you just of course want to make sure they are a safe distance away because of the pan being so very hot .as i put the hot maple syrup in with the snow , it 's of course melting the snow. [CLS] [SEP]and it should make for a consistency that is kind of like a slush. [CLS] [SEP], that 's what it looks like .so i 'll let the kids give it a try and see if they like it .here guys try it out .see what it taste like , tell us what you think .mmm .taste like snowy maple syrup ?yes .
we 're talking about how to spin around a bo staff .there 's many , many different ways to spin a bo staff around , so you ca n't really hold yourself to one .the best thing to do is go out into your backyard , just start experimenting around with this , and see what really works for you .to start out with a few basics , obviously , just something that is really not practical , but it just looks cool .you can add it in to your forms , or into your cottas , or anything that you make up , is just to take the bo staff , spin it around , and take one hand off , catch it on the other side , and just continue to flip , left or right hand ,whichever you start out with .i 'm starting with my left hand here , and just flipping it around .just make sure you keep it near the center .if you get off and you start sliding down , which is very easy , your weight is going to be unevenly distributed , and you could possibly lose your bo staff .another way , adding in strikes into spinning your bo staff , is to take , have the left hand palm down , the right hand palm up .what i do , is. [CLS] [SEP]i take it. [CLS] [SEP], i spin it around , to where my arms are crossed , but then i lay it up against my body , to the side , and that 's actually a strike in of itself , but then you can turn that , into a spin , by taking it , uncrossing your arms , changing your hands positions , so now your right hand is palm down ,left hand palm up .spin it to cross your arms , and lay it down , so if you put it all together , you just go back and forth , just like that .if you want to get a little bit more intricate with that , you 'd begin to scoop .you take your hands , same position , right hand palm up , left hand palm down .cross it around and lay it up against your body , and what you do , is you scoop down , change your hands , and now you scoop down to the other side , and it 's actually a continuous spinning of the bo staff .you just have to learn to change your hands at the right time , and make sure that you 're staying in the center of the bo staff , so those are just two or three basic ways , to be able to spin your bo staff around , and get started .again , experiment with it .go out into your backyard , and give it a try .
okay , so we got our panel , we got our topstitch , and it 's not perfectly smooth and everything , but after you do all your topstitching and pressing , it 's not a bad idea to go ahead and just re-iron the fabric .get the last little bit of wrinkles out , and the remaining wrinkles , if there are any , when we stretch the canvas , that will actually pull the fabric really tight , and you 'll see that there really are n't any wrinkles on this one .it kind of stretches the fabric to its amazing smooth finish .so , i 'm just going to finish ironing this , and then once you get that area , just set your iron to the side and you can slide it back .just keep this here .keep your cord out of the way 'cause that will add wrinkles .look at that .let 's get that side , and you can just come back and get this end .start that way again .and i 'm ironing on the inside because the seams are there .so , all right ; we 're ready for the next step .
i 've been keeping reptile amphibians for over forty years , i 'm here to talk to you about keeping gray tree frogs .gray tree frogs are native to , basically , the eastern half of the us and they are common mostly in the northeast , i live in austin. [CLS] [SEP]and we actually do have those here .they 're not as common as when i used to find them up in illinois but these are a frog that can get up to three inches long and they have orange back legs. [CLS] [SEP]and , as the name applies , they are gray. [CLS] [SEP]but they can also turn green .their heavy bodied frogs and during the day they usually spend their time in a place that 's shaded and cool. [CLS] [SEP], they come out at night to feed , they come out at night to breed .they do have the sticky toe pads that tree frogs are known for .i 've known quite a few that will live in potted plants and then they would come out of these plants at night to feed and look for food .they make fairly good pets and , like most frogs , they do n't like to handled. [CLS] [SEP]but their fun to watch. [CLS] [SEP]so i would say treat them like tropical fish , set them up , feed them. [CLS] [SEP]and they 'll be perfectly happy .
in this segment , we 're going to work on that same idea as we did in the last , using the six harmonies with an arm lock .but we 're going to do it as a partner exercise , to not only learn how to do this movement , but if done correctly with really nice intent , it 's actually a really great stretch and movement exercise for each partner .and learning how to listen .so if ray locks me up here , and then i do my movement , i come around , and now i keep coming around , keep coming around , i get him in the situation , then he pulls his hips under , comes around , gets me .i pull my hips under. [CLS] [SEP], i rotate my hand , rotate my arms , stretching .here is a good stretch for him , right ?i 'm pulling his wrist up , pushing his elbow down , rotating his arm .now if he pulls his hips underneath him , rotates his hips and shoulder , then it 's good for his body .and again , see this is actually a good stretch .if he has bad intent , he 's going to pop my shoulder or break my elbow or my wrist , but now i 'm feeling stretch in a way that i normally would n't get to feel .so now as i come up , i come around , he 's listening to my movement , listening to my movement. [CLS] [SEP]and he gets the same stretch .so it 's a really great partner exercise that you can go back and forth with .
back in nineteen-ninety-six , when i first started racing supercross , pretty much all you had to do to get your supercross license was fill out a paper and send in a bunch of money .they gave it to anybody and everybody .nowadays it 's not quite so easy .the first step in getting your supercross license is actually getting your motocross license .there are several series you can ride to accumulate points to get your motocross license .there is also the ama national arenacross series which will give you points to earn not only your motocross license. [CLS] [SEP]but you can also earn your supercross license directly through that .if you have your motocross license and your planning on trying to race supercross the following year .you need to go out and get top twenty in one of the ama professional motocross races which will earn you one point for the following season .then you will be awarded your supercross license .the only other way to get a supercross license would be do the national arenacross series and either win an event or finish top five in the series .which is a pretty tall order because there are a lot of ex-supercross racers and very , very good riders in their own right , racing that series .if your interested in attaining your supercross license , the best place to start is with the ama , the america motorcyclist association .you can reach them at one eight hundred ama join and get kind of a rule book and all the statistics , a series schedule for all the qualifier races .they have qualifier races pretty much all over .they are all ama sanctioned events .there 's regional qualifiers for the laredo land. [CLS] [SEP]dude ranch amateur national .there are several series that are just dedicated points earning series that will let you attain your motocross license and give you that opportunity to earn an outdoor point , therefore , gain your supercross license .so it 's a long and rocky road to get there .when you do get there , your racing with , you know ,the best riders in the world and some of the coolest tracks and the nicest stadiums you can imagine .it 's definitely worth the trouble .you put in your work and you know , someday you might be racing against james stewart and chad reed and hopefully , still ryan clark .
okay .now we 're going to put just a short but more complicated course together .what we 'll do is. [CLS] [SEP]we will start left-handed , we will canter our crossrail , turning , making a circle almost to the oxer , coming back to the crossrail , and once again riding that bending line over the pink vertical .and , what we should see as we start to do more complex courses , is that the horse starts to wait for you to tell them where they 're going to go after each fence because it becomes more complicated .
 , that 's visible from all directions .i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]not aware of a limit , as far as the size .what i understand is that it has to be visible from all directions , and this really is in your best interest .in that , other hunters can see you in the woods , and it reduces the danger to you , as far as someone accidentally discharging a weapon in your direction .here you can see right now , if you will , that i have on a bright orange cap , my hunter orange , and i have on a coat that used to be worn anyway , by the deer hunters here in the state of michigan .this is an old style wool coat , still very comfortable , and it 's actually pretty nostalgic to go out and sit in the woods with this .
so if you are living in a multiple dog household and you got one or two dogs that jump .so if you got a puppy that you are introducing to the household and you want to teach them how to jump it is important that you work with one dog at a time .you can see here. [CLS] [SEP]we got 3 dogs if they where all jumpers then i would n't be able to control any one dogs little along 3 dogs behavior .so even though it might be inconvenient it is very important that you work with one dog at a time that might mean that you might have to separate them 4 times when you are entering the house .there is a couple of times when jumping is most likely to occur and that is when your coming into the house if you have been out or if you are coming into a room that dogs hang out in .so it is important that you actually keep them separated so you can work with one dog at a time .we are just going to try walking around and seeing how these guys go whether they would actually jump or not .hey muffin how are you doing. [CLS] [SEP], how are you doing. [CLS] [SEP]are you going to jump up up .there you go well. [CLS] [SEP]she did that as a indentation .okay. [CLS] [SEP]so just kind of mellow around a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]okay guys everyone up lets go .hey guys lets go this way , good job , raven , munchiken good girl , come over his way .alright. [CLS] [SEP]so these guys are n't jumping actually. [CLS] [SEP]they are more interesting in playing with each other but you can see if they where they would all try and jump up on me this moment i would be able to do anything to control them .what we are going to do next is we are actually going to take a look at doing a entrance working at the door. [CLS] [SEP]and we would do it both way we would do it once with the three dogs. [CLS] [SEP]and then we would do it one with one dog .
a lot of people have a lot of the misconception that a lot of keyboardist will play style that was really popular in the '70s with the hammond b-3. [CLS] [SEP]organ where a lot of players would do a lot of quick fingering on the keyboard and will play fast trills or fast moving notes. [CLS] [SEP]; they would solo a lot , and not all keyboardists have to do that .in fact , when i play keyboard , most of the time , i sit and i play chords .with most people i think of when they hear about keyboards especially from back in the day , they hear more melodic , sounding stuff that would sound something like this .that 's more of a lead sound , and you could use that if you we 're going to be soloing , but a lot of times keyboardists really do n't do that .and so , what i do is i will play a lot of chords , and that comes from years and years of practicing piano and keyboards , but there are many different chords that you can use .so , it 's important to decide what needs to fit into your piece , what needs to fit into your song .what other instruments are going along in your song ?how would that effect what i am playing ?it is important using chords especially since the role of the keyboard in contemporary music is mostly help support ... [CLS] [SEP].
in this clip we are going to do a one leg balance with rotation .now you want to step to where you feel like you are nice and stable on the balance trainer , body should be nice and relaxed , knees slightly bent , shoulders relaxed .you are going to start off with the basic option , you are going to come up on your toe , arms out to the side and for some people. [CLS] [SEP]this is plenty of a challenge even just standing on the trainer .you are going to go ahead and rotate your torso and then come back to the level .you are going to be feeling this on the other side and feeling this in the obliques , the gluts , shoulders , forearms and the biceps .we are turning at that angle and bending the knees slightly .you may notice that one side of the body is a little more balanced than the other , that is kind of normal .rotate and bend .the other option would be when you are doing this exercise to have your leg a little bit higher off the trainer. [CLS] [SEP]or you can take it out to the side while you are doing this exercise. [CLS] [SEP]but we are just going to stick with the basic today .shoulders level , rotate and bend slightly and then come back to center .rotate .
tip number 2 : size .when we 're considering the size of jewelry that we 're going to put on our client , the first thing we think of is the size of the person .measure your height and your weight and determine what your bone size is in relation to your body .this can help you figure out if you want a chunkier jewelry , a more delicate jewelry , or something in between .for larger women we recommend chunky jewelry to help proportionalize the body and give a slimming affect .for extremely petite women , they ca n't carry off chunky jewelry as well because it overwhelms them and makes them look like they 're drowning in their jewelry .so very petite women need to stay with a more delicate or chain oriented jewelry , for the most part .again this is not a hard and fast rule .it 's just a guideline to help you begin your selection .and for men we always recommend a chunkier , more solid form of jewelry because this almost always looks best with most men 's frames .
then , i ca n't teach you much about clock repair in a short clip , but we can talk for a minute about why a clock may not be running .seems , as i 'm doing clock repair work , people are often surprised , even angry , if their clock has stopped , and i ask : ``well , when 's the last time you had it serviced ? ''and : `` oh ! we 've never had to have this serviced .this clock 's been perfect for years . [CLS] [SEP]''and , that explains why it stopped now .you ca n't , if you think about your car , you would n't brag about the fact that you have n't changed the oil in ten years .you , this clock is a machine , the same way other machines are , and they require service .in this case , particularly , it 's a fairly primitive machine , without sealed bearings , without a lot of fancy technology to keep it running , really unlike your refrigerator or , or other appliance in your house , which is of much more modern construction .they need service , and they will stop if they become dirty and worn , which is usually why they are n't running .you have with this here , where all of these shafts are turning inside , bearings which really are just holes drilled in the front plate of the movement .those holes can get worn egg-shaped just from the pressure and the dirt , and eventually , if they 're worn egg-shaped enough , the gears do n't mesh properly , the clock stops , and then someone like me has to do what 's called bushing , when you put a , a sleeve back in that worn bearing , so that it turns properly .also , too , just dirt builds up , and all of these bearings , they start out with just a little bit of oil. [CLS] [SEP], it 's open to the air , the oil dries , thickens , collects dirt , and you have too much friction for it to go .so , you talk about clock cleaning , but that really is n't as significant as what has to happen when a clock has to get taken apart , and deal with that wear and tear .the bigger issue to pendulum clocks is uneven ticking .i have a machine here that amplifies the tick .right now , even this is a little bit out beat , but probably still working .you listen closely , you hear a short and a long .i can make that worse by unleveling the clock .if i level it better , i get a nice , even tick .the clock 's in beat and it 'll keep running .many times , particularly with newer pendulum clocks , if they 're out of beat , that 's the only problem , and here you level the clock , or you injust , adjust it internally so the clock is ticking evenly .
in this segment i am going to talk about ball position .where you play the ball in your stance , is tremendously important .if you play the ball too far up , i 'm exaggerating , but if you play too far up , you have to make a compensation to hit the ball straight .if you play the ball too far back , you have to make a compensation to hit the ball straight .now those examples are exaggerated .subtle differences can also make a tremendous difference .in other words , if the ball is a little too far up , you might have to make compensation .if the ball is a little too far back you might have to make compensation .so the question is where you do put the ball , and the answer is where you would put the nail and the hammer .if we have a nail right here. [CLS] [SEP]and there was a wall , and we hit this nail in .would we put that nail way up , would we put it way back , or would we put it , what we call , in a comfortable place ?similarly , we put this to the next level .if there was a nail down here , and i had my long hammer , would i put the nail here , would i put it here ?i would put it in a place that just feels naturally comfortable for me , to hit that nail straight in , so i feel good .i might have to experiment a little bit .i am learning where to put the ball by asking the question , where would i put the nail ?once i am visualizing this nail , even there is a ball .when i feel the same as the hammer and the nail , this is exactly where i should put it .ball position , ask the hammer and the nail .
we will demonstrate today how we shave or remove hair on arms .the best way we have to see how hair grows , which direction it grows .i see from this direction to this direction hair is growing .we could remove it with wax perfectly .we have wax here. [CLS] [SEP]and i am going to apply a little bit on the spatula and apply to the hair growth direction perfectly and then put the cloth on it. [CLS] [SEP]rub a little on it. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's it .you are going to see how hair on the cloth and just pull out the cloth in the opposite direction of the hair growth .this is the best way to remove the hair or sometimes you could shave it if you want. [CLS] [SEP]and it removes it temporarily .this is the best way to remove or shave the hair .
before the use of papers in smoking tobacco , most americans used the simple corn cob pipe .smoking tobacco has progressed quite always since using the corn cob pipe .we 've come from roll your own tobacco in papers , to being able to roll your own with a machine , such as this zigzag machine .and now we even have a more advanced style , which is a empty tube filter .with an empty tube filter , we are able to use this new type of machine , to be able to load up a filtered cigarette with our own cheap , loose leaf tobacco , using one of these tubes .now to do this , we take our loose leaf tobacco , add a little bit of it into the center .spread it out evenly .compress the tobacco .add the tube .as simple as a quick slide .a little pinch to clean it up , and now we have our own filtered cigarette .many people enjoy a filtered cigarette over an unfiltered cigarette .filtered cigarettes tend to be a little less drastic of a smoke on your lungs , and they feel a little more at ease with smoking it .quite a few people do n't like , do n't care for spitting out the little bits of tobacco from an unfiltered cigarette .that is another complaint .i myself , enjoy a good filtered cigarette , but i also enjoy not spending my life savings on smoking a cigarette .
here we have one of our hookah pipes here at the hookah bar .by first glance you might look at this an think we 're doing something illegal over here .but no , this is a hookah .it 's been smoked in the middle east for about two thousand years now .they started out being made of wood and slowly it 's evolved in to what you see today .in the beginning they used it for hashish which is marijuana , and then it slowly went over to ,i think they used opium at one point .but then about two hundred years ago , they smoothed over to what 's called shisha which is this fruit blend .it 's a fruit paste tobacco , which is why hookah 's so socially acceptable today .and that 's what they smoke over there in the middle east as well .all those other things have gone out the window a long time ago .o.k. [CLS] [SEP], the different pieces of the hookah are , you have the stem. [CLS] [SEP], you 've got the base , you have the hose and you have the ashtray .and then you have the bowl and the shisha .and i 'm going to explain those in further detail .
all right folks , in this clip i 'm going to teach you how to draw an angel .just your basic angel , so we 'll start right here with his head .now , of course , he can be..just as easily a she as a he , although i do not even think that angels necessarily have a sex , per se .they 're just kind of generically known as being angels .but , we wo n't worry too much about that .so first we 'll start with his head , and i 'm just going to kind of draw a generic angel head here .come up here and draw the eyebrows .we have the face already .no need to go into a lot of detail .we wo n't ....the. [CLS] [SEP]trick when drawing these characters is to know where to really put the audience focus .and with an angel , we 're going to want , obviously , to make sure we do n't make his face distracting in any way .what we 're going to want to do is really call attention to this , his halo .that is your signature angel characteristic , and one that will obviously call attention to the fact that it is , in fact , an angel .so definitely make sure you get that part right .now the next bit we 're going to do. [CLS] [SEP]is we 're going to work our way down the angel 's body .kind of move down to do his tunic , and one way that i might do this is kind of show that the tunic has folds to it by just kind of giving a light , sort of flowing motion down like this , and then coming to sort of an end there .and you can show the folds in the tunic , and maybe draw even a belt .so that we can clearly see ...and now i 'm going to draw the angel 's hands coming kind of right out to the side , almost ....sort. [CLS] [SEP]of looks like an angelic pose to me for some reason .i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]not exactly sure why , but ... [CLS] [SEP]it seems a little angelic .so. [CLS] [SEP]yeah .you can obviously pose him. [CLS] [SEP]however you 'd like , him or her , however you 'd like to portray it .that would be a good start .so then what we 'll do is we 'll move down , and we 'll do a lower portion of the tunic , which again we 'll just sort of flow down and out .and what i will do actually sorta make it sort of a ... [CLS] [SEP]an odd , flowing shape .and then use your pen to come in and really draw in the folds and cloak .call , you know , just a little bit of attention , make it sort of a light , sort of a thing .and then finally the bottom .draw the feet , and we 'll actually draw this angel suspended in the air .so there we have his feet , and he will actually be flying , or floating , however you like to do it .now the most obvious other characteristic besides the halo will be the bit that we do right now , which is the wings .start with two golden arches , coming right out of the middle of his back just like that .come on down .and then what you 'll do is you 'll kind of progressively come in with the little lines along the bottom .so start with the furtherest feather , and then gradually work your way up to very angelic looking wings .and then the way that we kind of add some detail is we come up and do a line along the top .and then really show that these bottom feathers are the long ones by drawing lines up from the dips in the middle , just like that .and then , at this point you 're pretty good , but if you wanted to you could come in also and add some more layers ,like , i would suggest maybe coming in , drawing a few extra feather layers just like this on top of each other , just like that .and that looks pretty angelic. [CLS] [SEP], just the wing span alone looks very angelic i would say .
let 's talk about raising newborn puppies .there are two kinds of version of this situation .one is if you have a newborn puppy and a functional mother .but very often unfortunately there may be a newborn puppy that does n't have a mother .and so when you have a newborn with a mother , the mom generally is going to take over and raise that puppy as far as , you know , feeding it milk and that sort of thing .but most of the time what we 're facing and talking about here is when you have an orphan .and so when these guys are very small and of course just starting out in life , they 're very fragile .they need to be kept warm .they need to be kept stimulated from time to time also .and then they 're feed milk .you can get puppy milk replacer from your veterinarian and sometimes from pet stores with little feeding bottles .and so it will tell on those type ... [CLS] [SEP]on those bottles or on those cans how much to feed a puppy that 's newborn .they generally need to eat about every two to four hours depending on how fast they 're growing .they need that nutrition that often because they 're burning up so much energy by growing .generally speaking about four and a half to five weeks of age , you can start adding in like a wet food or a gruel type of food. [CLS] [SEP]so they 're starting to eat solids .and then by six weeks of age , generally you 're starting to feed them regular puppy food .and then they 're good to go from there .but newborns need that especially for those first few weeks , that milk nutrition over and over and over because they 're burning up so much energy .
all right , now let 's talk about the recording rate .when you record any song , you want to record at forty-eight k twenty-four bit , that 's the minimum .now there 's high qualities , you have ninety-six k ,i mean , this goes up , all the way up .but the best thing you want to do is forty-eight k. [CLS] [SEP]a lot of studios record at forty-four k. [CLS] [SEP]but i suggest you record at forty-eight k. [CLS] [SEP]because what happens is once you record the songs , they 'll render it down and put it on the cd , and that 'll be at forty-one , forty-four point one , sixteen bit .why you want to record higher is because a lot of times when they take songs for dvds and stuff like that , it 's forty-eight , sixteen .you always want to start off higher , because just like anything , if you start off higher and you bring it down , it sounds better than just starting at the lowest level and having to bring it up .you have to start high in the highest recording levels , and the highest recording sounds , and you bring it down to a lower quality , the sound sounds so much better .and so what you want to do. [CLS] [SEP]like i said is record everything at forty-eight k twenty-four bit. [CLS] [SEP], that 's the minimum .but if you can record higher , record at a higher rate .and you can tell the sound difference .i record a lot of things at ninety-six k. [CLS] [SEP]and i can tell the sound difference between ninety-six k and forty-four k. [CLS] [SEP], it sounds completely different .ninety-six k sounds crystal clear , and then when i render it down and when i put it on cd , it sounds way better than just the average cd .so what i suggest. [CLS] [SEP]y'all , is when you start recording , find a studio that records it at forty-eight k , twenty-four , or higher .
ah , so the penalties in fencing are organized into three tiers .you can get a yellow card , a red card , or a black card .so the most lenient penalty you can get , is really more of a warning , and that 's a yellow card .you get a yellow card for stepping off of the piste after scoring a touch as you make a fliche .you can get a yellow card for body contact in foil , no body contact is allowed in foil .you can also get one for removing equipment , so there are various other items that can be accidental , which is why the yellow card is fairly lenient .however , two yellow cards for the same offense , will get you a red card .there 's also a number of other offenses that 'll create , that will get you a red card , and that 's usually avoiding inspection , blatantly avoiding inspection , falsifying your inspection marks in some way , because all of your equipment before a formal electric bout has to be inspected to make sure that it 's all up to regulation .a red card is bad , and worse than a yellow card , not just because it 's red , but because a red card means a touch is scored against you , so your opponent gets an extra point .black cards are really , really bad .black cards will get you expelled from the venue , from the tournament , they can get you expelled from the tournament for future tournaments .a black card erases everything that you have done in that tournament so that it actually has a lot of repercussions on how other fencers who have fenced you are then ranked .the good news is , it 's really hard to get a black card accidentally .you get a black card through being caught using drugs , you get a black card through cheating , through refusing to salute , or otherwise being blatantly disrespectful , can actually also get you sent home with a black card .but most fencers are more concerned about offenses in the yellow and in the red , that they might inadvertently receive during a bout .
make sure you choose the right router for what your needs are .if you need a lot of bandwidth and distance or if you just need something small , that will all affect the different price of what you are going to be paying and overall what you want to do with the system .if you are going from place to place , make sure you have a wireless card for your laptop , if you need to connect it different places , such as restaurants or even hotels .if you have a firewall that you know how to control and if you do n't know how to do that stuff , never be afraid to call in an expert and have them come in and set up your wireless network or even set up your firewalls or wep keys .
one aspect of this sort of , traditional , darkroom work so to speak is time .doing this work technically , i do not really think it is that difficult .it is hard , but it is not rocket science .but , the problem for a lot of people , especially if you work , have kids , is the time .you would be surprised how much time you can spend in here and just essentially lose yourself .which is one of the best parts about doing all this stuff .but , to get the amount of time you need to set up , to print , and to do it correctly , i can not stress how important this is .if you are doing all of this stuff that i am talking about today in a rush , it is almost not worth it .so , you always have to look at your schedule .and , i have learned from experience about this .that i know that i have to manage my blocks of time in the darkroom very carefully because , if i do , i usually come in here for a few hours and i make great stuff .but , if i come in here in a rush and i am trying to go someplace to get to point a to point b. [CLS] [SEP]and i do not have the time , it does not work out .so again , always consider the amount of time that you have when you come into the darkroom to do work .
next thing we are going to talk about. [CLS] [SEP]is the delivery of water in between rounds .as we pointed out earlier , the days of sharing a particular water container then refilling it up between each boxer bout is over .you should have separate sealed water containers for each boxer .they all get a fresh water bottle themselves .the other thing is what we want to try to do is the boxer is going to be thirsty .the boxer is going to be thirsty .we do not want him to get cramped up in between rounds .we do not want him to be drinking too much water ; we do n't want him to be gasping right away because he is going to be having a hard enough time breathing. [CLS] [SEP]never mind drinking .what you want to do first is when he sits down we want to give him some water .a little water so that he can rinse his mouth out and then at least think that he has gotten a good drink. [CLS] [SEP]and then he is going to spit it out into the bucket .and then as we get a second out warning , we have ten seconds left , then we are going to give the boxer another drink of water and. [CLS] [SEP]that way he can drink that part of it .he can take a good guzzle and then he can go back out into the squared circle .nick , round is over !come on , nick !ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one .go ahead and sit down .you are doing good .how do you feel ?okay ?alright , i want you to keep working that jab for me ,okay ?it looks real good .okay .let 's get that mouth piece out .spit this first one out .okay. [CLS] [SEP]nick ?swish it around good .there you go .good job .let me see that. [CLS] [SEP]and i will rinse out his mouth piece .remember to keep your hands up and your chin down .do n't square up .okay .how do you feel ?do you feel fine ?i feel okay .okay , the second assistant is going to be rinsing out that mouth piece while the head coach is working the boxer in the corner .we will get that nice and fresh to put back in there .this will also give him a shot of water .okay , we got ten seconds .seconds out !one more , swallow this one .okay. [CLS] [SEP]nick ?here we go , mouth piece in. [CLS] [SEP]and we are all set to go back out there in the ring .
 , really makes a nice base .so 1/2 cup of that , 2 teaspoons of corn starch , throw that in .it helps thickened the sauce just a little bit , 2 teaspoons of low sodium dark soy sauce , 2 teaspoons of canola oil and 2 teaspoons of dark toasted sesame oil , and a 1/4 teaspoon crushed pepper flakes , you can add more or less depending. [CLS] [SEP]how spicy you want it .and finally 1/4 teaspoon of salt. [CLS] [SEP]and you just want to whisk this together and set it to the side .you 'll also want to keep on hand 2 extra tablespoons of the vegetable broth for while you 're actually cooking your stir fry , there you go .
now let 's go on to line twenty-five .and it continues with those same triplets and slurs , ok.so it 's the same pattern as before .ok , so now let 's take a look at my hand .fourth finger for ' c ' sharp with third right there .move it up .flagellate , remember , shift up .ok.then we 've got .then double stops ok.that is our twenty-fifth line of this boriat piece .
a common question with a lot of bikes is how you would shift it and which gear is correct. [CLS] [SEP]so we talked about before what type of shifting it is. [CLS] [SEP]but if you were riding for example on the flats , not too much uphill and not too much downhill you would address it here in the rear end of the bike as the chain goes up the cassette. [CLS] [SEP]it becomes easier to peddle so for example if you were riding and the terrain started to go uphill like up one of the canyons you would start shifting to an easier gear .basically that gear i put the bike in. [CLS] [SEP]is the easiest gear on the bike. [CLS] [SEP]so that is your climbing gear .if you have ridden to the top of the hill and you are heading down you would start going down the cassette to make the gear harder. [CLS] [SEP]and eventually you would put it into the big ring on the bike , big ring for down hills , small ring for your uphills. [CLS] [SEP]so this particular bike has everything for going up , for going down and for the flats as well .super easy to shift and with a little bit of practice , customize it to fit your needs on your own ride .
now where i colored , i say we 're going to have some very limited applications of some violet color ; some violet pigment , now ’ s the time .i 'm looking for some of these regions here where it 's goes from kind of some of this lighter oranges and pinks into this deeper blue and some of these areas. [CLS] [SEP]actually i want to deepen this ; i want to make it more of a violet effect , so i 'm going to start to apply this here in these crevices .you 're automatically going to notice a pretty big color difference from that and the surrounding colors .so when i 'm going to continue to expand this out ; now i 'm not applying a lot of violet here and also what ’ s more. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]using it. [CLS] [SEP]and you can see to really blend these layers together .now really to blend for sunsets. [CLS] [SEP]the over arching rule is when you start off with your one pigment. [CLS] [SEP]and you kind of go. [CLS] [SEP]and you build it out , and at some point you start building the other pigments into it by going down into them and bringing them up into the violet ; up down and around .see now look at that. [CLS] [SEP], that 's all ; that 's pretty blended now .let 's apply another region of violet further over this area where i 'm going to darken this up somewhat. [CLS] [SEP]and sometimes this is going to really subtle. [CLS] [SEP]; i mean look at that , that 's not that much different. [CLS] [SEP]but it is different still .now hey , there you go if you actually put a little more intense violet. [CLS] [SEP]you 're going to see a whole lot more difference. [CLS] [SEP]and again we build these guys back in here ; this is the atmosphere .the atmosphere is one huge inter-functioning crazy chaotic machine ; the weather forecaster 's still trying to get it down .so all of your painting is inter-connected ; do n't see it as discreet layers , see it as some living ; breathing thing with all the parts inter-connected , it needs all these things to survive or in this case out on one brilliant light show for us .so we 're going to continue to build in some of these violet in a couple of these darker regions and threw out our painting again for more of like a contrast with the over , over lying brighter layers .
now just to show you a regular pop we 're going to have rafaela demonstrate .so when you 're popping you 're contracting both your biceps and your triceps , what you want to do is focus on the release of that , so pretend like you 're flexing for somebody , and then you release that , and that 's what creates the pop .now for a dime stop which is another style of popping , it 's when your whole body is contracted and you want to create a picture , so right now rafaela wants to create this picture , so her body is tense for the entire time and what she 's doing is at the very end of that contraction. [CLS] [SEP]she 's releasing that tension little by little which creates a wavering effect , alright .so again she 's creating a picture. [CLS] [SEP], she 's holding the tension till the very last minute and then slowly lets it go little by little which creates that illusion .now doing dime stopping can allow you understand how to go into roboting and to stop motion animation .this has been yvonne chow with how to pop .
you want to be aware of signs like this…these are repeat signs and that tells you that there is going to be a section of a piece that ’ s going to be repeated .now if you start at the beginning of the piece here is the first repeat sign , you don ’ t worry about it. [CLS] [SEP]you keep on playing , keep on playing , keep on playing and now as you ’ re coming along here you ’ re going to come to the second repeat sign , the second repeat sign tells you to go back to the first repeat. [CLS] [SEP]and so this section is repeated again .now often times music will denote a first ending and a second ending so when you ’ re coming through the second time because you ’ ve already played the first ending this time you would skip right to the second ending and that ’ s how you would end the piece and that ’ s all you need to know about repeat signs .
okay now for a final touch up , i use the same sealant because it is an excellent exterior ceiling just to finish off the edge to make it look like its been there. [CLS] [SEP]and it belongs there and very easy to do .just stead all the way down and what you do n't get steady all the way down cleans up with your finger pretty easy .
now we 're going to show you have to do a take down from the partiflex position which starts out. [CLS] [SEP], she throws a punch , come across .you can either get your partiflex from here. [CLS] [SEP]or you can do it the traditional way here , but either way that you do it. [CLS] [SEP]your right leg is going to have to step behind her , her right leg , and so once you step behind. [CLS] [SEP]you take your right arm and just clothesline. [CLS] [SEP], it 's sort of like the throw that we practiced before , and sweep out and throw .so we 're going to work it a little bit slower .i 'm going to start with the simple position partiflex .she throws a punch , you block , you come across , you lock .before you throw you want to make sure that you drop all these techniques right in here. [CLS] [SEP]so you can execute the throw properly .you take a step with your right leg back , drop it and throw .so one more time. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll execute the full technique .comes in , block , strike , partiflex , possibly breaking the wrist , coming across and throwing .and that is pretty much an assertive grab. [CLS] [SEP]but again your out from the outside position. [CLS] [SEP]so you have to keep in mind that you are not necessarily inside and having to worry about the arm , you 're actually reaching over their shoulder which is another situation where you have to be careful so that if they were able to get out. [CLS] [SEP]you do n't get an arm bar executed on yourself .so the switch when you 're dropping your hand out of a partiflex and going in for the throw has to be done relatively quick for it to actually be executed properly .so that is a partiflex with a throw from the outside position .
this time , the burmese dance , we will talk about the hands .it 's very important , the first thing when i tell you about your basic form and also burmese has the basic form for the hands too .when you look carefully , that look like bot cake , so anytime you 're dancing the hand. [CLS] [SEP]always stay like that. [CLS] [SEP]but , the transactions , when move quick or something like that , maybe you can lose a little bit but make sure when the dance is finish you have to repositions like this always .so let 's try this one , stretch , firm , check my profile , now squeeze the hand .and you know , those three finger up , putting together is not a good really , good idea , just a little way back .so when you see the people , ah let the people to see you , like a bird. [CLS] [SEP]has a feather up here and a peak here .so keep always like this .
after you get passed doing just plain exercises , you 're going to do one more .it 's halfway in between exercise and an actual drawing because what we 're going to do , is we 're going to do not a blind contour but a contour drawing .we 're just going to draw all the lines that we see on the bear here .we 're not going to try to focus on any of the shadows .we just want to get all the shapes and all the proportions. [CLS] [SEP]right .so , one technique that i 'm going to use is i 'm going to use big kind of shapes ; big shapes to start out with. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'm going to go in and make them more specific and modify them .so they look more like the subject. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm trying to draw .so , i see the body .the body is kind of like a circle. [CLS] [SEP]and i see the two feet in front. [CLS] [SEP]and they 're like little ovals that are set from my perspective. [CLS] [SEP], they 're about , one-third of the oval is inside of the circle and one-third of it is not. [CLS] [SEP]and they 're kind of off to the side .so here 's one. [CLS] [SEP]and here 's the other one and. [CLS] [SEP]this one 's kind of going off .the foot is going underneath and this oval 's inside. [CLS] [SEP]and this is just real , real kind of basic .we 're just trying to get the main shape .this kind of tapers up to the top here .there 's a line where the head meets the body. [CLS] [SEP]and then we have the arms coming off .they kind of overlap on the body a little bit and from my perspective. [CLS] [SEP]once again it 's about a third of the arm is going to be overlapping on the body .i 'm kind of drawing things that i ca n't even see .i 'm drawing the body that goes behind the arm a little bit here. [CLS] [SEP]and i can see this seam right here going around the front of the hand .there 's a seam going across the neck .i 'm also going to add in the arm here .once again the arm is probably about a third of the way in front of the body .so , i 'm going to add that in the drawing ; and you can see the seam coming right along the bottom here .you can almost see it up here .so , then from there , we 've got the bottom part .those are a little bit small and then we 're going to move to the head and looking at the head and the body , the head is actually about the same size as the body and that 's one of the things where you have to pay really close attention to whatever it is that you 're drawing because a lot of the time , your mind is going to jump to conclusions like ,oh well bears have smaller heads than their bodies and then you 're going to end up with a drawing that does n't look anything that you 're trying to draw .so , i 'm just trying to focus on getting all the proportions right here .i 'm not really looking for an accurate depiction and then the nose takes up about half of the face , if you look right there .it 's about half of the entire face. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's kind of like an upside down triangle almost .draw a little bit smoother ; and the very tip of the nose is right in the middle and once again i 'm not shading .there 's a hint of a little bit of a frown there .and then the eyes are kind of sunken in on the sides here .this one 's really hard to see because he 's kind of off to the side here .so , i 'm just going to put a little bit of one there. [CLS] [SEP]and then i can see a lot more of this one. [CLS] [SEP]and that is the basic idea of how to get a contour drawing done .
hi !this is chef rainer wickel here today on behalf of expervillage.com .well we 've gone over all the utensils and ingredients we need to make this dish and now it is time to get started .the very first thing that we need to do is we need to melt the butter because the butter is actually what is going to be making up the base of our sauce .now it is extremely important that you get unsalted butter .now , you do n't want salted butter because we do n't want that salty flavor in the dish. [CLS] [SEP]so make absolutely sure you get the unsalted kind .now we are going to be using about 2 tablespoons of butter in this and usually when you get the butter , it is already marked on the stick. [CLS] [SEP]so just go ahead and cut it appropriately .now we are using a 10 inch skillet for this and what we want to do is put the heat up to low .we do n't want to go ahead and start cooking this butter up too high because we do n't want to burn it. [CLS] [SEP]so just set the stove to low .what we will do is we are going to be putting 2 tablespoons of butter in here .so just go ahead and grab your butter and up into the pan .now what we need to do is we need to let this melt. [CLS] [SEP]and we need to let it simmer and wait until the butter is completely melted in there. [CLS] [SEP]and then we are going to start adding the ingredients .now remember we want this on low .you absolutely do not want this butter to be cooking too fast because we want to let this simmer because we are making a sauce out of this. [CLS] [SEP]and we do n't want to burn it .and this is how we prepare our butter to make our bananas foster .
we are still talking about scrapbooking and the different options that you have when it comes to time and money to invest in these scrapbooks .on the front cover here i just used stickers , there actually blue stickers , and i just stuck them unto the cover of the scrapbook .with black puff paint went over each letter so that way it has a little more texture and depth to it .but , at the same time if was n't a freehand writing. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's neat and organized .so , i used those stickers as a guide kind of like a stencil so that i could use the paint over them without messing up the cover .then i just stuck some stickers around the outer edge which matched the cover of the scrapbook .it gave it a nice depth and texture feel as well .
so in those 27 different emotional reactions that we have every hour some of them are going to be on that spectrum of anger .and once we recognize the body symptoms again the gnawing of the teeth , the clenching of the hands , one of the most important things that we can do is called changing our state .and it is a very very simple thing to do actually .there is a couple of key things to remember .one is that when the emotions are coming up and we do n't want to feel them regardless of which emotion. [CLS] [SEP]it is our tendency is to hold our breath , we literally stop breathing .and so the fastest and easiest way to change your state is to take a deep breath. [CLS] [SEP]and now i do n't mean. [CLS] [SEP], i do n't mean an exasperated sigh , that is not what i mean by a deep breath .i literally mean filling up your whole body with a full breath , using all of your lungs to bring in oxygen , that life giving energy and move that other energy through the body through the exhale so it is a big ...and literally your physical state changes and because emotions are chemicals and action in your body. [CLS] [SEP]then your emotional state changes .another thing you can do is if you are sitting down stand up and if you are standing up sit down , if you are standing still walk , movement is a great way to get energy in motion actually to go out and through the body. [CLS] [SEP]so you can let go of whatever it is that is going on .now these are all things that we have been talking about that you can do when you are first recognizing that if in fact you are annoyed , frustrated , angry , whatever word it is on that big spectrum called anger .let 's take the next few segments and talk about what you can do when anger has been built up and you want to let it go so that it does n't explode in the wrong place at the wrong time on the wrong person .
alright , first try , i do n't even need my three other darts .hi , i 'm stephanie with partylandutah.com. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]teaching you how to play , the heart breaker game .you can set it up any way. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's really fun because you can use teams or you can do boys against girls or. [CLS] [SEP]you can just go and just give the darts to a new couple , that you see talking to each other , and try and get them to play the game too or. [CLS] [SEP]you can just grab some people that maybe look like they 're being a wallflower during the party .go over to the wall and grab them , give them the darts and then go grab someone , of the opposite sex , and give them the other darts .as a host , you 're going to want to make sure that everyone at your party is having a lot of fun and you 'll have a lot more fun too because you 'll know that everyone is enjoying the party .then you can just stand back and start playing your own game of heart breaker and hopefully you 'll get better than i am .that is how you can make everyone have a lot of fun at your party and just realize that there are going to be some duds that do n't want to play games. [CLS] [SEP]and they just want to sit on your couch and drink some wine and just be alone .whatever they want to do , just let them and make sure that everyone is having fun and doing what they want .
it 's a way of assigning numbers to the notes on those scales .for the rest of the series , we 're going to base what we 're learning off of the c major scale .as i explained earlier , it 's one of the easiest scales to use because there are n't any accidental notes , it 's all natural notes .we do n't have any sharps or flats in here .so , it 's pretty simple .we 've got our seven different notes , eight at the end there .all assigning a scale degree to these notes means is that we -- instead of just referring to them as the note names themselves , c , d , e , f , g , a , b , c , we give them numbers , and we just do it in a consecutive order ,so we call them 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7. [CLS] [SEP]and then you can either call this one 8. [CLS] [SEP]or you can just call it 1 again too. [CLS] [SEP], that 's all right .now , this works with any scale .here when , of course , the c major scale but. [CLS] [SEP]i can use this number system when referring to any scale .so , if i wanted to talk about the 7th scale degree , it does n't matter what scale we 're in. [CLS] [SEP], i can say we 're talking about scale degree 7 and everyone knows what that means .and you 'll hear that among musicians when talking about specific notes in the scale and also talking about chords .we 'll also see how we build chords out of each one of these scale degrees .it 's convenient also when we 're playing guitar .a lot of the times when we 're playing a scale or when we 're playing in a key on guitar , it 's more convenient to think about patterns of numbers that we can move around , shift around on guitar than just the notes themselves. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll see that in a little bit , too .so , these are scale degrees .
hi , i 'm emily larew , and we 're continuing on with our advanced tap combination .we 're on counts five through eight .so , we just finished our running pickups , having a care in the world , three and four , you 're going to stop .let 's just do our feet .you have five and you have a scuffle heel , and a six. [CLS] [SEP], you 're going to step seven , toe heel stop .try it again .five , scuffle , heel , step , toe , heel , stop , all right .try it one more time .five and sixy and a seven and eight .remember it 's quick .fivey and a sixy and a seven and eight .try it one more time .stomp scuffle heel , step toe heel stomp .great work .from there we 're actually going to turn it around , so you have one and two , three , four , five and a six , and seven and eight .and you 're going to turn it , all right , and to the front .so one more time .you stomp and throw five , you 're going to turn it around , scuffle , heel , step , toe , heel , stomp , and press forward .good .so five , six , seven , eight .one and two , three , four , five , six , and seven and eight .great work .
the live community in whist is tremendous .it is nationwide .it is in many of the big cities .you can check up with any of the online groups .you can check up with the meetup.com group .they give you the opportunity to find bid whist in your local community .there are internet opportunities to play .i know. [CLS] [SEP]cases ladder online is had a good bid whist site for a long time and there are other programs you can get for bid whist to .the idea is that if you have the opportunity , now this is peculiar , because you take the spades game .spades game is predominantly internet with a limited live community .here you have the opportunity to play live and play with some really , really good folks who like the game , congenial , have a great time .the whole bit .again , go to sharks inc. [CLS] [SEP], and check that out as well .when you 're playing live , you have a room full of people , there 's a camaraderie. [CLS] [SEP], it 's just really a great time .play with a partner , meet your friends from the community , or meet people from around the country or so forth .totally different decorum , similar to the live in spades , the live in pinochle , the live in hearts .just a different type community all together .when your playing online , you cultivate relationships with your partner or with your online friends .you get a chance to practice .that 's the beauty of online .play against the bot , improve your game , hone your game .then you 'll be confident when you do go to a live tournament that you 'll be what we call competitive .so , check out either venue , online first , then live .
one of the other things that we want to go to is some more energy that we can use quickly .you 've probably seen this in gels that have come on the market and there 's many fine gels , but we also have them incorporated into things like jelly beans now from jelly belly , very tasty , but also work very well .remember , the key thing here to get that quick energy boost is find something that you enjoy eating and like the taste of .in that way , you 'll actually use it .remember , that these are very good but mostly short term energy boosts but work really well .so , experiment around with a few different companies and try a few different flavors of things .lastly , remember that once you 're done with your ride , one of the important things and almost important thing is to be able to recover so that you feel good the next day , then you can go do that ride again .there are many products on the market that we 're going to help you repair that muscle tissue and help you recover better .hammer 's one of the companies out there that makes a very fine product to do this process .you can buy these in individual packs or larger containers .mix this with some water , taste a lot like a milkshake .it tastes good , works good for you , and best of all , you feel so much better in the morning .
now , i have sewn all of my seams , and what i want to do is i want to trim the excess ,and then i 'm going to run a zig-zag stitch over it , so. [CLS] [SEP]it does n't unravel .so , i 'm just trimming to a quarter of an inch , each seam allowance. [CLS] [SEP]cause i do n't need it .you can go slower. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm just seasoned in practice , so i go fast , cut fast .but , you can also sit it down on the table , and that way you can be really accurate with your cutting , cause you do n't want to cut over the line you just sewed .you do that to all four .and then what you do when you 're finished. [CLS] [SEP]is your home sewing machine will have a zig-zag setting , and i put it at a number three .i make it kind of wide because i do n't want the fabric to stretch itself .if you put it around the two , or the one , or close to the zero , it 'll just get a little stretchy , so i go around the three , maybe in between the three and the four .and , i just zig-zag. [CLS] [SEP]the edges .it just looks more , you know , it 's just cleaner when you wash it , it 's not going to come apart , et cetera .it 's like a home surge .i happen to despise the surger !i do n't know if you have a surger , and if you like it , more power to you , but. [CLS] [SEP]i just , i zig-zag instead of surge .so , you want to do that on all four seams .
okay , we 're working on our cutting for our humorous interpretation .and we 've got. [CLS] [SEP]-- we 've already established that it 's going to make sense , it 's going to have a through line , and it 's going to have a beginning , middle , and end .we 're going to take bits and pieces throughout the play to put this story together .but one of the things that we have to make sure exist is conflict and resolution .and what conflict and resolution is the big event -- the big explosion , the characters get in a fight , or they get together. [CLS] [SEP]and they get married , or what is the big event that must explode that we 've been working for ?now after this big explosion , he goes to jail. [CLS] [SEP], she leaves , he divorces her , somebody dies , whatever this giant conflict is , then our cutting also has to have a resolution .and what a resolution is , is what happens after this conflict ?she died , so now we 're moving on .she got thrown in jail , so now the husband 's going to have an affair .whatever it is , there must be conflict resolution .

i 've shown you here a tackle box in which i keep lots of oil paints , and i do this so that i can close up the box , and i want to talk about the kinds of paints that you can buy .some of these have been given to me many years ago , and many i 've bought more recently .and i ...and either you can deal with all these kinds of paints , or a group called my mary , and italian set , has a little ... [CLS] [SEP].italian group has a try-out set that you can buy , and it really has three tubes of paint , the three primaries , yellow , blue and red .and so you can make your green from the yellow and the blue , and then you can make your orange from the yellow and the red , and you can make your violet from the blue and the red that you will mix .so that 's one way that you can add white to make lighter tints , or add black to make darker shades .and that , i have friends that work only with these three colors of paint .there are smaller tubes and larger tubes .and just like watercolor or acrylic , a tube of paint can last for a pretty long time unless you 're painting a large canvas .most canvases for easel paintings are , let 's say , ten by sixteen , or something , like , twenty by twenty-four .but you can also do thirty by forty , and much , much bigger paintings .and you 'll go through a lot more paint when you do that .paint can be used just out of the tube , you can mix it on a piece of paper like this .you can apply paint with palette knives .you can apply paint with brushes .there are many different kinds and sizes of brushes , larger brushes for larger canvases .there is ... [CLS] [SEP].this. [CLS] [SEP]is the tail end of a roller that was supposed to roll the paint out of a large tube of white .however , i still have n't gotten it quite out of the tube .when you use the larger tubes , such as these bigger tubes , they wo n't fit in any of the compartments so that they have to go , you know , down below .but these are colors that i frequently use when i 'm painting , and i just finished doing a couple of very large pieces .also , for white paint , there 's titanium white , and there 's other whites , and some cover more than others .some paints are more buttery than others .some ...they , they 're made by an enormous group of different people .daniel smith up in seattle .the gamblin people , who have taken many of the poisons out of paint .people talked about mad-hatters with mercury , well , paint has barium and other heavy metals and many of those have been taken out and replaced now with chemical paints .you can ...you can look at the manufacturers information to be sure that you 're not buying something that would hurt you .cadmium 's another heavy metal .so to make all these paints , you can see that we have brilliant color that 's pretty long-lasting now , much more so than it used to be .you can mix with turpentine alone , you can mix it with poppyseed oil .or you can mix it with something which is ....here 's one , just one object called gamsol .you can mix it with various other , you know , you can mix different kinds of oil and different kinds of mediums .we used to use turpentine all the time , but the smells are not very good from that , and it can be injurious to your health .so there are also kinds of oils that you mix with water , and i have n't even gone into those kinds , but i prefer the slow drying , regular oil paints that you would mix with turp , or gamsol or some other medium .you can add thinners , you can add quick dryers , but an oil painting will either be done very quickly , a la prima , in one go , or you can paint on it , and take your time , and fix and eye shadow or something , if you want , over a longer period of time .you can clean your brushes , and add new medium in these little cups if you want to , or you can just avoid those all together .when you 're done , you 're going to clean these paints off your body , your clothing , whatever , and some are more easy to get out than others .but at least i hope this has given some small inkling of information as to what to look for when you 're buying paints .this is eileen pestorius .until the next time .
and the creativity area is always when you are standing in a room. [CLS] [SEP]and you are in the doorway. [CLS] [SEP]and you are facing into the room. [CLS] [SEP], creativity will always be the wall that is to your right .so that 's the creativity area .and there are many different things we can do to improve creativity , lots of different options that we can use and. [CLS] [SEP]they all depend on what you like and what you are going for .so i 'm going to talk a lot about different things that you can do to improve your creativity .the way to figure out where the creativity area is again , to face into the room , hold this paper with the bagua right in front of you. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 'll know that creativity is over to your right hand side , somewhere in the middle of that wall .it 's sort of a circle of energy , all these nine areas they intersect , who can tell where they begin or end but. [CLS] [SEP]in that general area is where your creativity will be so .you might already have a desk there or maybe a chair to sit at and do something creative .or maybe you have a bookshelf there .so nothing is necessarily bad , it 's all depending on what you want to do in your life with your creativity. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to cater that to you and what your choice is .so on this bagua you 'll see that the creativity area is actually labeled as children .and it 's actually both .a lot of baguas will call it children/creativity .children is obviously something that you create , so that is definitely part of the creativity .and you might of been more creative when you were a child .so this is , it can be anything that you wanted to create in your life .it could be children , it could be family , it could be art. [CLS] [SEP], it could be cooking , it 's anything that you make .and you put love in and energy into .so that 's why some of the baguas you will see for this school of feng shui. [CLS] [SEP], will just label it as children .
two cases of fist cuffs in the o.r .first in belgrade , yugoslavia .a man was on the operating table for an emergency appendectomy .his surgeon was about to cut into him , when another doctor entered .apparently an enemy of his surgeon .and that guy hit the guy in the ear .actually punched him in the nose .said something insulting and walked out .well his surgeon was not going to accept that , he went after the other surgeon .they got into a fight , some teeth were lost and a hand fractured .what about the patient ?well the assistant surgeon actually completed the appendectomy .now let 's go to tokyo and the shiga general hospital .a patient was on the surgery table and suddenly he got cold feet .he said he did n't want to have the operation , which was an intestinal operation .the surgeon was so insulted , do you know what he did ?he punched the patient , punched him in the forehead and he started to bleed .so the operation was canceled .surprisingly , the patient three weeks later , actually opted to have the operation , but with another doctor .now you know what i say to him ?if your surgeon punches you , do n't take it lying down .i do n't care about the scalpel .he hit 's you , you punch him back !yes !you punch him back !
all right we are back. [CLS] [SEP]and we just removed our shrimp from the shrimp boil and. [CLS] [SEP]we got a nice gentle steam coming off of these guys .so i placed them in the bowl and as they are steaming , i just want to take the exact same seasoning that i used to poach these guys .i 'm going to sprinkle that over the top of them. [CLS] [SEP]and you see me wearing these latex gloves a lot .never is it more important when you are messing with seasonings like these because you do n't want to get it into your skin over a long period of time because it will start to irritate it .also once you are done , you can just pull the gloves off and throw them in the trash and wash your hands and there is less risk of you getting this into your eyes .there is cayenne pepper and things of that nature in this seasoning mix and it is not a lot of fun when that happens when it gets in your eyes there .so i am just going to kind of twirl these around. [CLS] [SEP]so we get a final dose of seasoning on them .what i am going to do next is just throw these guys into the refrigerator and let them chill for probably about a half hour. [CLS] [SEP]and these guys will be nice and ready to eat .this is what you want to look for as far as the almost finished product .we are ready to go and put these guys into the refrigerator and chill them down and that seasoning is going to stick to these guys and it will make a really nice tasty treat when they are done .
hi , this is jon , and in the clip i 'll be talking about tool storage .now once you 've accumulated a number of tools , it 's always good to build some type of a storage unit to house all of your tools. [CLS] [SEP]so you can find them. [CLS] [SEP]and so they do n't get damaged .in this particular storage unit we 've just taken some pegboard and screwed it up against some 2x4 's. [CLS] [SEP]and we 've used some pegboard hooks to be able to hang some of our tools .additionally we 've designed some other storage type devices to be able to accommodate the different types of tools .now there 's really an unlimited number of possibilities that you can use to hang and display your tools , but you always want to keep in mind that the bottom line is to be able to keep your tools safe from getting damaged and so that you can find them every time you need them .here we have another storage system just for some simple palm sanders , and we 've put those on rollers , made that into a drawer , and those are all located in a cabinet that locks .now it 's always very important to keep all of your tools locked up or out of the reach of anybody who does n't know how to use them , or especially children .additionally you 'll notice that all of my tools are labeled so that if for some reason. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm using all of my doweling jigs. [CLS] [SEP]and i forget where they go. [CLS] [SEP], i just look at the label. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]able to put them back .you really want to create a method that works good for you .if something does n't work , change it and use something that works better .
no fat that mom always sent you to the store for .what gives meat a flavor and what gives meat a good texture is going to be a little bit of fat .and particularly a ribeye is going to have a little more than normal .but then also the marbling that 's inside. [CLS] [SEP], now mine is condensating a little bit so you might not be able to see it .but there is a little marbling throughout .now that 's not fat that you are going to taste as in terms of feeling in your mouth .but what it ?s going to do is it ?s going to give moisture to your meat .so any time you are looking at buying red meat that is what you are looking for .you also want to make sure that the meat is being stored properly .that the thermometer on the temperature , the temperature on the thermometer is below forty-one degrees so it ?s kept cold .and if you are me , you want to look for steaks that look like this .now bear with me for a second .because you do n't want anything that 's green or funny looking .but anytime a meat starts to age , it oxidizes .so the bloods in the meat will start to turn from a red to a brown color .that 's just age .to a certain degree , this is actually going to be a more flavorful , more tender steak .and typically discounted in the grocery stores .so shop smart .look for marbling and shop in the end section and save your self a few bucks .
so mainly there is this kind of staff rattan .it is also known as a double headed staff .it is called double headed because it is of equal thickness throughout the staff on each end .it is a very flexible type of wood and it is very strong .it will last a very long time .double headed also means that you do one move with one end and then immediately you will do another move with the other end of the stick .so this way .the move will go side to side , up and down with varying techniques .so this is a very pliable type of wood .it has to be the same width from the top all the way to the bottom and the size of the staff. [CLS] [SEP]depends on what you are doing .mainly the staff would be about as tall as you are or sometimes it could be a little bit taller .there is also other kinds of staffs , the eyebrow type staff where it goes up to the eyebrow height or another type of staff comes up to about the arm pit height depending .mainly they are all used the same. [CLS] [SEP]but this is your most basic type of staff and your most traditional one .then there is this kind .this is a white wood wax wood staff and this is commonly what you see today .this is used throughout modern china .it is made of a different kind of wood as i mentioned white wax wood and it is tapered on one end and. [CLS] [SEP]it gets thicker towards the bottom on the other end .that is so , this is a lighter type of wood and in the competitions they like to be very very fast. [CLS] [SEP]so this looks a little more impressive .what they do is they do the same types of movements but due to the weight being a little bit heavier on one end. [CLS] [SEP]it makes your flowers and the different techniques a lot faster and those are the different types of staffs .
the first thing you want to do is a tire pressure check .and i 've got my handy pressure gauge , i may not do this every single time i run the tractor .but once a week at least .every time you want to walk around and give them a kick and check , but at least once a week you want to give them a quick check .now the pressure will vary depending upon the size of the tires on your tractor .in this particular case we only want to run about fifteen psi in it , it just barely registers on this gauge .it 's typical that you run a much lower pressure on tractor tires than you do on car tires .the reason this is important is because you can get in a situation on a tractor , where you have an implement in the air , and we 're about thirty psi on this front tire .and that 's exactly what i want to see on this size of tire .i was saying that 's important , because any thing that alters the balance of the tractor can be a potential safety problem .you get an implement up in the air , one tire is much lower than it normally is , you 're on a slope , and that can create the chance of an overturn .
today 's topic is how to change a hubcap .there are many different varieties of hubcap .one of them is this small type which has four screws in it .you unscrew the screws , pull the hubcap off .there are two basic types of hubcap , some that screw off and others that pop off , like this one .you pop the hubcap off and you put it back on the same way , hook it on. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's on .this hubcap comes off by placing your screwdriver or your tool in the toolbox and pull it or prying it off .thus , it 's getting , it 's being able to get to your lug nuts .to put it back on , it 's a simple idea of just pushing it on .the screw off on a more modern wheels and expensive wheels have a screw on cap which have a screw on the side to take the cap off .this is the proper way to remove a hubcap .
today i thought we 'd talk about how to draw a bunny .well how i usually start drawing a bunny. [CLS] [SEP]is i always think about the ears first .and you get that first. [CLS] [SEP]but you have to think about how , bottom heavy it is .think of it as a number a. [CLS] [SEP], here comes the , the letter a not the number .here is the eyes .this is detail. [CLS] [SEP]but you take the nose. [CLS] [SEP]and you always think about how the shape is .here 's the legs , and it 's like very bottom heavy .and what i mean by that , it has the bottom part of it is thicker on the bottom .so when you draw a bunny you have to know that the body is bigger on the bottom , there 's a circle there. [CLS] [SEP], there 's a circle here , underneath it .and then there 's shapes coming up like that .even look , think about an egg .they lay eggs so here 's the egg shape. [CLS] [SEP], here 's another egg shape on top of that .so it 's two eggs and that 's kind of odd because bunnies lay eggs. [CLS] [SEP]do n't they .here is an easter egg .we 'll draw a lot of bunnies especially on easter when i do easter parties .they 're just so cute .kids love. [CLS] [SEP]and i like them too .well i hope that explained to you guys a little bit more of how to do a bunny .remember there 's egg shapes in the bunny. [CLS] [SEP], that 's an interesting one .till next time i see you guys next time , thank you so much .
this is g , the lowest sounding string on the violin .this is d , one of the middle strings on the violin .this is a , another one of the middle strings on the violin .here is open a. [CLS] [SEP]and here 's our last string on the violin , which is an open e .
hi , i 'm emily larew and now we are going to put the whole beginning hip hop combination together up to tempo .are you ready ?so i hope you 've had plenty of time to practice this slow , because now we 're going full speed , all right. [CLS] [SEP], there 's no stopping .so , here we go .five , six , seven , eight .and one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .one and two , three , four , and five , six , seven , eight .one , two , three , four , five , six , seven and eight and one , two , three and four , five , six , seven and eight .one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , and eight .and that was your entire hip hop combination full out .
once you picked your frame then you need to pick a matte board that is going to become comfortable with the pieces of what your framing is .as well as comfortable with the room that you are going to be putting it in , this particular customer has a lot of blue in her room .so i choose two different color blue to show her just to show her if she had a clue .i personally like the more subdue blue than the brighter blue. [CLS] [SEP]it tends to give you a lot of color with your piece on this particular piece .i think it will be real nice piece in a room .all sides have to be covered with a matte board so that you have a solid color base to start with .if your pieces are very busy , you want to pick a more plain piece of matte board if they are very plain you might want to think about getting something with a little bit more character to it , a little bit more design .there is a lot of matte boards out there to choose from .it 's just a matter of picking the one that fits you .
next , i 'm going to select the roses .there 's many different varieties of roses , there 's spray roses , there 's , these are a large variety of a tea rose .they 're a very large variety , but they 're pretty .and there 's also long stemmed roses , there 's many different varieties , colors , etc .now we 're going to want to choose a rose that 's going to last a long time .on this particular design , i 'm going to use the pink roses , because first of all they have a nice height and we want our roses to be one and a half to two times the height of the container .one is fine actually .so , we 're going to use these .they 're nice and big roses too .now to select a really good rose , all you need to do is , squeeze it .and by squeezing it , you want it to feel very firm .because that means it 's got a lot of life left in it .it will open up quite a bit more .so , if you find a rose that is like this , it 's very pretty , but it 's not going to last very long , because when you squeeze it , you can almost , you can pinch it really tight .so that 's how you can select a rose that is going to last for quite a long time .
first and foremost , you 're going to have to get phyllo dough .it 's a specialty item .like i said , we 're fortunate enough to have the euro mart right across the street which i 'm definitely going to do a video soon , and i got their permission. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'll show you how great this place is .you got ta have to let this thaw at room temperature for about five hours before you can work with it .it is hard to work with , but if you follow the steps on how to work with it , you 'll be fine .all right .so some phyllo dough .you 're going to need about 8 sheets -- 10 sheets .it only comes in 8 so , of course , i got two .you can save it for other uses though .you 're going to need about a half of pound to a pound of fresh lamb .now if you want it the way the recipe calls , it 's 8 ounces .i like to make my puffs a little bit more .we 're italian here ; we eat good .some olive oil for just getting our vegetables going and our onion and stuff .you 're going to need curry powder .this is what flavors up that lamb. [CLS] [SEP]so good .fresh thyme , fresh parsley , salt and pepper to taste , and then all you need is just a small to medium onion , two to three small to medium tomatoes and a potato .okay , that 's it .you 've got your curry phyllo triangles here on expert village .really , come back and make this .i know. [CLS] [SEP]-- you got to try different things in the kitchen .that 's what makes it fun .spice .come back , we 're making it .
the beatles song i get along with a little help from my friends referred to drugs .now , how do you tell if your partner has a drug addiction ?it does n't have to be illegal drugs .they can be prescription drugs .it can be illegal drugs .it can be a drug of choice that may be sort of legal. [CLS] [SEP]like it 's on a special list of legal drugs .you probably wo n't know from six to nine months .people who have these addictions are very , very good at hiding them .please believe this , i 've had four people call my show , both men and woman , who would tell me , i never had a clue until eight months , ten months , a year , over a year into the relationship .i was shocked .and i found out by accident .one found out believe it or not by finding pills that were in an aspirin bottle , she almost took them .turned out that they were n't aspirin at all , but the bottle said they were .that person was taking this medication on and on and on .so you wo n't know .it 's not an easy thing to find out .if you once face the issue and there 's no way to back out on that person 's part , the addicted person 's part , go to counseling if this person 's important to you and this relationship is important to you .you will not beat it otherwise .please believe that , no amount of being co-dependent or having understanding is going to make it happen .trust me on this one .this is doctor paul .may your fantasies of today be your realities of tomorrow .

now i 'm going to show you how to make these victorian rose eggs .it 's a densely patterned egg .and it 's cut from scrap book papers or wrapping papers .it 's densely covered and then you put little motifs on it .we have butterflies and birds .little things that when you look at it at first , you do n't see it. [CLS] [SEP]but you discover it as you turn it around .so i 'm using a piece of scrap book paper that has these pretty rose motifs around .now the biggest problem with decoupaging the egg is it 's very round .and paper is flat and it does n't , it does n't always want to follow the shape of the egg .so i 'll give you some little pointers on how to adhere it nicely to the egg .so first you want to start by cutting out a lot of small motifs .so from this design , i 'm going to cut just the rose section .i 'm going to cut the leaf section .i 'm going to cut some , some of this lace section that i 'm going to use cover my egg .
i am going to demonstrate the staff pose .i love the staff pose because , although it 's simple , it 's great for strengthening the legs .it pulls the abdominals in and creates a nice tall straight back .first , i want you to align your shoulders with your hips .you are going to draw your navel in towards your spine .as you inhale , you are going to place the palms of your hands down on the floor .now , i have long arms , a lot of people can place their hands right by their hips without flexing their arms .since my elbows bend slightly , i ?ll straighten my arms by moving them slightly in front of my hips .next , i 'll pull my toes towards me .this creates tightens muscles through my legs and strengthens as i press my hamstring muscles down into the floor .this pose is great for strengthening the muscles of the legs .then , i 'll look forward .i create a long straight neck .i just gaze out in front and take a deep breath .i open my ribs. [CLS] [SEP]and i close them back in without drawing forward .keep your upper torso very tall or straight .repeat .keep your neck long and straight .the crown of your head is parallel to the ceiling .take one more deep breath , pulling your toes towards you .try to lift your heels off of the floor because it really strengthens the legs .then you 'll relax the pose taking your hands back and placing them , palms down , behind you .take a deep breath here .if you can only hold this pose for one breath , especially if you are a beginner , you may modify it .tighten your legs up , pull your toes towards you and lift your heels off the floor .here , you 'll take a deep full breath , exhale and then release it .hold this pose with your arms at your shins .you may repeat this version , trying another full breath .you may use either of these options .
this is a dribbling while walking drill .it seems like a really simple drill but you notice as you get started it is a little more difficult than it appears .this is great for using hand/eye coordination and for just getting your hands strong and using good ball handling techniques .i am going to show this in slow motion. [CLS] [SEP]and then i am going to go full speed .you are going to start pushing the ball through your legs and have your other hand ready to meet the ball .now as you get better you are going to be able to do this without stopping so i am going to demonstrate that right now .always remember to keep your eyes up and try not to look at your feet while you are doing it .you make a mistake , just get back on and do it again .that is walking while dribbling full speed .
now we have our wings like this and they are unfold it like you want them .what we are going to do is we are going to make sure we are going to take. [CLS] [SEP]we are going to make sure first that our pieces that we have them between the 2 pieces here .1 ,2 ,1 ,2. [CLS] [SEP]well this one is not really. [CLS] [SEP]so we would open it back up like so .there it is flat side on that side and that side .flat side on that side and what we are going to do is take this edge here .we are going to fold it over like this. [CLS] [SEP]so we have this part here .we are going to take it down on the bottom edge here just like so .then fold it back. [CLS] [SEP]and then we are going to do the same thing with th other side .we are just going to fold it up like this , fold it the other way , fold it all the way down and make sure that is get really straight .that we do n't bunch up that point there .we are going to fold it back like that .
as i said before , time is money , which is true of any business anywhere .when you 're a freelancer or a subcontractor , obviously because you 're not clocking in and clocking out of an office , there 's really no way of gauging how much time you 're working on a project if you were n't writing it down or keeping detailed records .a lot of times , a client will ask you at the outset , `` how much is this going to cost me for , say , a three-minute video ? ''well , you need to take a very long look at past projects , things you 've done for other clients , so you can give them a reasonable expectation as to how long it 's going to take .it 's very important not to undersell the amount of time it 's going to take on a project because then you might end up cutting your rate in half .when you price a project out , you want to make sure that if you say you 're going to have to spend one hour on this piece of graphic or this piece of video that you 're not spending two hours on it because that means you 're getting half the money .this kind of a trap is very easy to fall into , especially for beginners , and you can learn a lot of expensive lessons along the way .my advice would be to make sure that once you 've agreed to a price on a project , you do the work that is expected of you ,you deliver what you can , but you do n't overextend yourself when it comes to time , when it comes to effort and energy because if that same client asks you to do another project , they 're going to expect the same amount of work at the same price ; and if you put in double the time that you originally promised , you 're going to have to do double the time again for the same price .so just make sure that you 're safeguarding yourself against excess deadlines , excess client expectation so that in the end , it 's a mutually equitable partnership for everyone involved .
today , we 're going to discuss hiking boots , backpacking boots , and rock climbing shoes .the best thing for hiking or backpacking , would be a boot that comes above your ankle , for support .i like oslos .it 's a great boot , lasts a long time , waterproof .depending on the situation that you 're in , or the place that you 're hiking , you would want to do some research , to figure out what the best boot would be , for your situation , whether it 's warmth , comfort , support , or waterproof .when it comes to a rock climbing shoe , there 's a variety of different types .in our gym , we like to use velcro slippers , because they 're easy on , easy off .outdoors , for more technical climbing , you might use a lace up , that tightens up the toe box .anytime that i hike into the woods , i 'm wearing an approach shoe .my approach shoe has climbing rubber , just like a rock climbing shoe , a solid toe box , but it 's ' more like a boot , or a shoe for hiking .this has been our segment on shoes for hiking , backpacking and climbing .again , my name is scott , in wilmington , north carolina .
ok , here we go with our lydian mode on the d string .so again , we 're doing a few whole steps and then a half step to finish .we 're going to have d , e , f-sharp , now jump up a whole step for g-sharp and then a. [CLS] [SEP]d , e , f-sharp , g-sharp .and it 's that half step from g-sharp to a that should clue you in that this is the pattern that you 're using .so again extrapolating from the notes we 've already learned on the d string .we have d , e-flat , e , f , f-sharp , g , g-sharp , a. [CLS] [SEP]so the full range of notes on the d string up to a should now be getting under your fingertips and you should be learning those note names .
first we take white sauce which is prepared out of flour , butter and milk .now we have added fine chopped cucumber and tomato to it .now we add some cabbage to it which is again fine chopped .mix it well .now we take a slice of bread , apply this paste evenly all over the slice .now , after applying the paste , we put capsicum and tomato .then sprinkle pepper and salt and then place another slice of bread on this .and then place it on the toaster and leave it for three to four minutes .so now , after four minutes , your toast is ready .so let 's see .now we take this toast , since it 's properly toasted , place it on a plate. [CLS] [SEP]and then we can have it with either tomato ketchup or maybe mustard sauce , as per your wish .so here you go , your toast is ready .
and welcome back we are here and all of our vegetables have been prepared and if you like any tips on any of these vegetables refer back to steaming broccoli , saute vegetables , and grilling asparagus .for of any of these that you want to see personally by me you can come and visit me at zedo 's at 17 in tuscon it is a wonderful place to eat for mediterranean style food and we love to cook for you. [CLS] [SEP]so come on down and join us .
in the last segment we made a bracelet out of the waist band of these jeans .the second thing that i 'm going to do. [CLS] [SEP], i want to wear these , they did n't fit. [CLS] [SEP]so i eliminated that problem by taking the waist off .their girls pants for two , their flow , i do n't like anything about them except for the fact that we can make something else out of them .i know i 'm not going to want to keep them this length. [CLS] [SEP]and i need material for a patch. [CLS] [SEP]so alls. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to do. [CLS] [SEP]is just cut a patch right out of the pants .the knees come up here. [CLS] [SEP], you 've got to kind of assess how long or short you want them ,whatever style .i 'm going to do my style kind of like the things i 'm wearing now with the cuff down here just below the knee .so , rather than cut too far up in there , because i can always cut later. [CLS] [SEP]and i have no idea where that 's going to be. [CLS] [SEP], i just need material for a patch .i 'm going to come down right here. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm just going to cut this bottom segment off. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll make a couple patches out of that .
alright everybody let 's do that cool variation. [CLS] [SEP]i was telling you about .so have a card selected .okay , remember that card .wonderful !we 're going to put the deck in the box , then we 're going to seal up the box with a rubber band. [CLS] [SEP]so you ca n't open it or anything .i have a paper bag here. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to open this up .i 'm going to need my pen .we 're going to take the deck , put it inside the bag just like this .then i 'm going to take my pen and carefully jab it right through the bag just like that .the part that 's amazing is that if i rip the bag off the pen , i 've stabbed one card , your card the queen of clubs .in the minute i 'm going to show you how to do that trick .
let me demonstrate three exercises .the first one will be lying down , and the other two will be standing up .so , first one i 'm going to do is , i 'm just going to lie down on my back , hands flat on the floor , feet flat on the floor , knees up , i 'm going to take a deep breath in , when i breathe out. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to thrust my pelvis off the floor. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to squeeze my butt together .take a deep breath in , and breathe out , breathe in , breathe out , squeezing , breathe. [CLS] [SEP]in , breathe out .if you 're a beginner , well , actually , there 's a lot you can do with this , so i would recommend if you 're a beginner , go for sixteen .if you 're an intermediate , advanced , go for twice that amount .and one set for beginners , two sets for intermediate/advanced .alright , so now i 'm going to go ahead and demonstrate the two standing exercises for the butt .so right now i 'm going to go ahead and move my mat a little bit out of the way. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to stand in front .having my hands right on my waist , back is straight , i 'm going to take a deep breath in , and i 'm going to breathe out. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to lunge forward , and slide back , lunge forward , slide back , lunge forward , slide back , lunge forward , slide back .if you 're a beginner , one set of twelve .intermediate , advanced two sets of twelve or more , depending on what you feel you can handle .alright. [CLS] [SEP]so , this is the third butt exercise .you know , i 've got a chair. [CLS] [SEP]right here , i 'm going to go ahead and support myself , just like here with the chair .i 'm going to work one side of the cheek , so i 'm going to have one foot back , on the toe , knee straight. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to take a deep breath in , i 'm going to breathe out and extend the leg back and behind me .not straight back , but more at an angle .you notice that i 'm not bending forward cause. [CLS] [SEP]then there 's no resistance , and then i do n't get any work , so i push against the chair to keep my back straight , it 's a very small motion .one set of twelve if you 're a beginner , more of that if you 're intermediate/advanced .you want to make sure that you work both sides .and those are my butt exercises .thank you .
we 've just talked about the forward sweep , now let 's look at the reverse sweep .reverse sweep starts in the back of the boat .you wind up your torso , placing it behind your seat and sweep out and away .again , looking in the direction where you want to go. [CLS] [SEP]and i also want to use my torso .so let 's do in combination with that forward sweep that we discussed earlier .i 'll do a forward sweep on one side and a reverse sweep on the other and you can see the combination and what happens to your boat .here we go !forward sweep , wind up ,plant by your toes , look where you want to go , then i 'm going to reach all the way around to the reverse on the other side. [CLS] [SEP]and it spins in the spot .again using those key principles where i 'm using my torso to wind up the stroke .here we go !winding up the torso , place by your toes , sweep out and then the reverse comes all the way to the back and sweeps out to the front .key thing to remember in whitewater boating we use the reverse sweep rarely , occasionally we 'll use it. [CLS] [SEP]but you do loose your momentum .so concentrate on the forward sweep instead of the reverse sweep , but it 's always a good skill to know .
now i just talked to you about letting this set up until it is leather hard .it is best to do it naturally for a few hours. [CLS] [SEP]or so. [CLS] [SEP]but i am impatient. [CLS] [SEP]so i am going to use a torch .this is a good way to speed up the process in clay if you need to move to the next step .now i have put it on a banding wheel which spins. [CLS] [SEP]and i have centered it .i will just spin this piece and move the flame up the piece slowly and back down. [CLS] [SEP]and i will continue doing this with the torch until this piece has reached the leather hard stage .as long as you do this evenly. [CLS] [SEP]and you do n't let the flames stay on any one piece of the part for too long. [CLS] [SEP]it is not going to hurt it .now if you take your torch and hold it against one part of your vase for a long period of time you are going to crack your vase right off , right open .so you do need to be very consistent and patient with the torch .
lunge is the sister to the squat .it 's basically a one legged squat .very dynamic movement on the floor , alone .but once you 've got that mastered in your form and you 're ready to progress , this is a great balanced challenge to integrate that kinetic chain from head to toe .just as you would take one foot forward , and you 're always going to favor one side or the other , usually if you 're left handed. [CLS] [SEP]you 're going to favor putting your left foot forward .try to mix that up so that you can get that cross problem mechanism going and working with that kinetic chain .you 're going to aim for the center , the middle of the bosu ball , come up , weight in the heel. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're behind the toe , and you 've got to have your back leg extended enough where you can hit that peak contraction here .hip bends as a result of flexion and extension in the leg muscles , front and back all the way down , and you 've really got to balance here .take your time , make the movement slow , inhale and exhale .you 're working concentric , eccentric all the way on both phases on these .contract down , and release up .if you feel yourself start to shake , start to wobble , put your hands out here to the side , maintain your balance and then boom , add that movement back in again .this is hard enough just on the floor .you go adding this bosu in. [CLS] [SEP]and you 've got a pretty good balance challenge going there .then just make sure you switch it up , do about twelve to fifteen reps on each side .work your way up .
re going to take your wax paper and put it on top of your design .take a pencil and draw everywhere that you want paint .again , if you want the paint to show the whale body then you will be coloring in the whale body .but i like the lines to show. [CLS] [SEP]so i am going to draw the lines in .for your first screen print , you really want to make sure you do n't do anything too complicated .so we 're going to do this nice , simple , happy whale design .
hi , and welcome .today , we 're going to show you how to pick a hair relaxer .now , this is something i do n't suggest , for someone that is not a professional , but if you just have to do your own hair , and you ca n't make it in to the salon , we 're going to show you how to pick a hair relaxer .now , number one thing is , there is a such thing as a no lye , which comes in two parts , and there 's also a no base , which comes in one part .now , there 's a great difference between the two , and if you 're buying your products in a local beauty supply store , i would stay away from the two part .the only reason why i say this , is because you 're not a professional , and sometimes. [CLS] [SEP], we do n't know exactly when to take the relaxer off , and these can leave your hair dry and brittle .the second thing is that , the no base relaxer , which you use right out of the tub , can be better for the hair , but it can also be an irritant .it can also irritate the scalp , so again , use caution when using these products .they 're very good for straightening out the hair , and they can leave you with silky , flowing hair , but if they 're not used correctly , you can end up with a lot of problems ,so remember , be careful when choosing a relaxer .ask a professional , and take precaution .my name is sylvia russell , and this is how you pick a hair relaxer .
just won ’ t work .the drain plug is located in the center of the pan usually , i ’ m going to look for it now to locate it .this one happens to be on the end of the pan , which isn ’ t a problem and what i like to use is a crescent wrench because this wrench fits all. [CLS] [SEP]and it ’ s easy to use .so we ’ ll take our crescent wrench , put it on the drain plug , start to unscrew the drain plug .okay , we ’ re unscrewing the plug , now its finger tight so you can unscrew it with your hand , let your oil drain .these are the steps we take to drain the oil in the vehicle .
if i click in the administrative account i can create a password .i 'm going to type in my new password and again type it in again. [CLS] [SEP]and you can type in a hint word and then create password .when you click yes to file protect your documents , what that means is when your child logins into their account , they wo n't have access to your my documents file and all the previous files that you 've created .now you 've created a password for your account and when it 's time to login your child will not be able to access your account if they do n't have the password .they will only be able to access their account .
what we are going to talk about is basically how to prevent global warming or commonly known as going green .there 's many steps we can take to reduce our emissions , reduce pollution , and reduce the amount of energy that we use every day as individuals .we can start by keeping our car in good running order and planning our trips accordingly. [CLS] [SEP]so we run several errands in one trip , one right after the other .another is to have a energy audit done on the home .turning off things that use power every day .televisions , computers , chargers and things along those lines are using power the whole time they are plugged in even when they are in the sleep mode .those could be unplugged .things like energy blankets around the hot water tank and using less energy overall by using the new fluorescent type of bulbs that use about one third less energy then the incandescent bulbs .and things along those lines can help reduce energy consumption and pollution .using less gasoline to power lawn equipment , and going more with electrical power equipment would be another way .there are many ways to go green and to reduce global warming , it takes just a little bit of research and time on every individual 's part to think how we can be more efficient and use less energy and reduce our emissions and pollution .i 'm captain joe bruni , stay safe and we 'll see you next time .
all right , folks , in this clip i 'm going to teach you how to draw an ecstatic expression on a cartoon character , just really overjoyed , happy face .i 'm going to do it right up here in this corner .so , let 's move up there .ok , and the key to this one will definitely be , as well , in the eyes .we 're going to make them extra big .and one way to make the eyes look all ecstatic is , traditionally , you would draw some sort of eyebrow or an eyelid definition , but we 're not going to do that .that really helps sell the ecstatic expression .make the mouth as high up as it possibly can be .nice and big .and then draw his tongue .now , that really helps sell the happy expression .another way you can do it , just to really make sure they know this guy is ecstatic about something , is make his eyebrows really high up .normally , they 'd be somewhere in this area .we 're raising them just a bit there , just to make them really sell the fact that this guy 's insanely happy .then you come right around here , just kind of build around , a giant open mouth .just like that .come in here and draw the ears and up to the hair .the eyebrows , in this case , will actually overlap the hair just a little bit .that 's ok.it 's kind of a good way to show just how happy he is .and you can call a lot of attention to the eyebrows if you want .looks a little silly , i know , but it 's just a good , solid way to show that the character 's really happy .raise his eyebrows up .make his eyes wide and full .mouth open like that .make sure the tongue is clearly defined in there .and there you have it .this would be definitely the ecstatic look .all right .and there you have it .
right now , we 're going to learn the a minor scale .earlier , we learned the a major scale along with the a major arpeggio .a little later , we 're going to learn the a minor arpeggio to go along with this .but , this is the a minor scale .( plays ) .and now , we 're going to go down the scale .( plays ) .so , that was the a minor scale and. [CLS] [SEP]a little bit later , we 're going to learn the a minor arpeggio .
so when it fits on top of it , it will be nice and smooth .i have already baked a cake .this is a yellow cake to go with my chocolate and strawberry ice cream. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to cut it because it 's slightly larger than the bowl .to do that , i 'm laying it down on a piece of parchment paper. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]removing my parchment paper i used to bake .with a nice sharp knife , i 'm going to just basically cut along the side of the bowl and you can take the leftover cake and eat it plain .you can do all different kinds of cakes too and mix them with the different ice cream , you can do a chocolate cake and make chocolate mint ice cream or chocolate cake with a sorbet or something .if you wanted to make it a little bit lighter but now that we have our cake cut i 'm ready to form the ice cream mold .
today i 'm going to show you how to change the ip address of microsoft windows vista .let 's go down here to the bottom on the vista. [CLS] [SEP]start bar which is this little round button , and we 're going to run a command prompt .at this command prompt , to see your current ip address type `` ipconfig '' , all one word .this will list out all of the adapters for a network that are installed on your pc , and the one that we 're concerned with is the `` ethernet adapter local area connection '' which is this one right here .just look down right below it as you can see the ip version 4 address that 's been assigned to us is 192.168.1.50.inside the control panel find the `` network and sharing center '' , and this lists your current network settings and their status .what we have here is `` access local area connection '' .to change the ip address on it let 's click on `` view status '' , and then down here at the bottom we 're going to click on `` properties '' .this shows you all the protocols that are installed for that adapter .the one that we 're concerned with is `` internet protocol 4 '' , or `` ip 4 '' .select `` internet protocol 4 '' and click `` properties '' .it 's currently selected to obtain an ip address automatically from our router , but we 're wanting to change that , so click on `` use the following ip address '' .we 're going to change it to 192.168.1.51.now what we had before was 50. [CLS] [SEP]so we 're just going to bump it up by one .the subnet mask is automatically populated as soon as you pop it into there .the default gateway is going to be the ip address of your router , which in this case is 192.168.1.1.you probably do n't have your own dns server on your network , so you want to pipe that up to your router too , 192.168.1.1.after you 've got all this typed in let 's just click `` ok '' , and `` close '' .that will actually apply the changes that you 've just made .let 's go back to our command prompt and verify that those changes have taken place .we 're going to type , one more time ,`` ipconfig '' and press `` enter '' .as you can see under our local area connection , ip address 192.168.1.51 .
and i want to relax my ankles. [CLS] [SEP]so i do n't pull any of the musculature .i am hanging upside down now , full extension .if you have any problems with your sinuses you might feel a little pressure. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm just letting you know that .you just want to hang here and let your arms hang .and we can do various exercises here which we will get into in our next clips .
but , you got. [CLS] [SEP]your puppeteers does n't necessarily mean that they all know how to operate the puppets .alright hopeful you had a audition process. [CLS] [SEP]were you see if the person that you are recruiting has potential to be a puppeteer .some of them may be natural puppeteers and they know how to operate puppets beautifully. [CLS] [SEP]but , if they do n't you could train them .i would suggest to pick up some books on proper mutilation for puppeteers because there is a right way and a wrong way to operate puppets .now at expert village i placed a video on tips for the puppeteer .tips for the puppeteers. [CLS] [SEP]so you may want to check that out it has some great tips on how to operate characters for there , stage , film ,what ever .there is definitely do 's and don'ts when operating characters .every thinks that it is just so easy to put a puppet on and make it come to life. [CLS] [SEP]well it is definitely a skill that you have to either have .you could be trained to do it. [CLS] [SEP]but , definitely you want to make sure that the people that you audition at least have the potential to get to that next level .
you can use briskets , or marrow bones , stew meat. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm using a dark meat turkey called churma you can also use chicken and a lot of soy substitute meats , they 'll all work fine .we 're also using 6 potatoes , 2 onions , 1/2 cup of barley , 1/4 cup of barbecue sauce , 1 can of beans , 2 tablespoons of olive oil , 3 cloves of garlic , 1/2 teaspoon of pepper , and 1 teaspoon of salt .
the next thing i am going to talk to you about are the different types of trail ratings .basically there are three to four different types .you have your green circle , your blue square , and then you can either have one diamond or two diamonds but. [CLS] [SEP]either way they are both going to be black .the green circle terrain is something that is probably going to look a little bit like this .it is going to be nice and steep. [CLS] [SEP]so you can allow yourself to pick up speed. [CLS] [SEP]but there is not going to be very many variables on it .it is more of a beginner 's trail for some of you who just topped off the bunny slope .the blue square trail is probably going to be a little bit not as flat , and they are going to throw a little bit more variables at you .it is not going to be every so many feet. [CLS] [SEP]but i mean it is not going to be as flat as something like this. [CLS] [SEP]and then blacks and double blacks not only are they going steeper. [CLS] [SEP]but they tend to put in mogul sections and on a double black you are probably going to go even more steeper with even more moguls and basically the easiest way to do it. [CLS] [SEP]is one , two , three , one. [CLS] [SEP]you are a beginner , two. [CLS] [SEP]you are intermediate , three. [CLS] [SEP]you are advanced and if you find yourself on a trail that is higher than what you rate yourself , stay off of it .
all right .now , you are an expert of the wheelchair now ,right ?okay , now the only thing you need to know is how to get down safely .i showed you the falling way. [CLS] [SEP]but that 's really not fun because you can hurt yourself pretty bad. [CLS] [SEP], right ?so , the best way to actually get off this wheelie is just like i was showing before , you know how to rock now , you 've been doing your training .so , you 'll notice that if you push forward too much , you 're going to go backwards too far , right ?if you pull backwards , you 're going to go forwards , all right ?so this is very easy , very simple step , a no-brainer. [CLS] [SEP]but i 'm still going to tell you how to do this just in case you were wondering .all you 're going to do , pull forward , and it drops you down , right ?then , it 's as easy as putting on the brakes , taking the thing off , and getting out and going ,all right ?so , that the easiest way to actually get out of your wheelchair once you are up .
there 's all kinds of unusual clocks out there .most of what we 've looked at , basically have a face and hands , that indicate the time in a traditional manner , and do n't do much else , except maybe. [CLS] [SEP]some striking , but timepieces were used for many other purposes too , where you wanted to time things in a specific way , or have some additional features on a clock , that would n't be on an ordinary clock .we can look here .this is a pigeon race timer , so when you were racing your pigeons , the pigeons would have a band on their leg .when the pigeon returned , the band would be dropped into here .later on , you could see the band 's position , and note the time that the pigeon returned , and. [CLS] [SEP]that way , you see who won the pigeon race .chess timers , two clocks here .as you started to make your move , you would press that when it was your turn .when you stopped , you would press the other side , so that each chess player had the same amount of time to play .this is actually a waltham .this is a gas light clock , where this clock would be affixed to the gas fixture of your gaslight at home , and the light would shine through the milk glass face , to show you the time at night .you can see that glass is cracked , like almost all of them are , from the heat of the gas flame .this is an english reminder clock .not only does it tell the time , but if you wanted to , let 's say wake up at a certain time .here 's our nice label explaining it all , but you would take this ivory tab , perhaps write on here , take pill .put it in the time you wanted to take it , say if this were two o'clock .this rotates as the clock runs .at two o'clock , our tab drops through , falls into here , lowers this down , and a bell rings , at which time you read it , and say ,oh yes , take pill , and you 're ready to start it again .finally , our orrery clock .this is both an annular clock , indicating the time on horizontal dials , and there are many french clocks , particularly of that style , but this adds a whole orrery system up here , where you actually see the sun , and several of the planets , including the earth with. [CLS] [SEP]it 's moon ,which rotate also , as the clock is running , so if you want to do more than just tell the time , or perhaps just tell the time and know the date .there are many versions of timekeepers that are a lot of fun to own , and to watch .
alright , drink we 're about to make is called a psycho .let 's go ahead and put some ice in a glass. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll measure out one. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm sorry , two ounces of rum , here 's one and two .follow that up with one ounce of galliano .and next we will add four ounces of orange juice and four ounces of pineapple juice or whatever you have left , how many you have left .now let 's go ahead and shake that up , let 's mix it back and forth a couple of times , that 'll do. [CLS] [SEP]and we got our glass .go ahead and strain in over some ice .and the last thing we 'll do is add some grenadine .this is the perfect opportunity to get a little `` wee , wee , wee '' .alright .add a straw and bottoms up !
the chinese word for the staff is the guan .the guan was a weapon that was very practical in use .the weapon was something that most everybody would have had access to .and to be able to use a guan. [CLS] [SEP]meant that you 're going to be able to defend yourself pretty much anywhere because everybody basically carried a stick and it was seemingly a harmless instrument .unlike the japanese , it 's typically a softer wood .the wood that i 'm using here is called rutin .as you can see it bends .i believe that the reason for the bending is that so that when someone would be hit with a guan , it will be less at to kill and more at to whip and beat .so it 's not to kill the person .the guan was developed by monks as a weapon .and the monks were very concern about not killing so they would use weapon similar to this .the chinese guan does give you a whipping action , as you can see .the whip would allow for a person to feel the pain but not be internally harm .the guan is broken down into three sections similar to the japanese bow .the japanese called their staff a bow , and their bow is broken down into sections like this .the chinese generally break it down into sections like this .they longest section would be to keep your opponent away .the middle section would be use for blocking .the smaller section would be use for bracing , so that , most of your attack would be away from you .all the , this is generally how the bow was kept .there were different turns and maneuvers that you could do with the staff that will allow you to be able to switch sides .chinese staff .
the third you 've got to know you about skipping stones is choosing the right location .choosing the right location for skipping stones is one of the most important steps .make sure that the body of water you choose is calm .this means that there should n't be any waves .also thumb make sure that there are n't any objects , people , or other obstructions in the stones path , because this would impede the stone from skipping .obviously , this the wrong place for skipping stones .why ?because it is too shallow and it does not have enough space for skipping the stones .hi !this carmen conde for expert village , and thank you for skipping stones with me .
so the most important aspect of even playing , before you start playing , is you want to kind of loosen your bow a bit .and at the very end , when you 're done playing , you 're going to completely loosen it before you put your bow away .but when you first take your bow out and your tightening your hair , you do n't want to tighten it too much .you actually want it to be slightly loose .you should be able to touch the stick against the hair , like that .you want it to be slightly loose , you do n't want your hair to be too taught , because when you try and play you 're going to feel it in your arms .so you kind of want to practice loosening it .then , at the end when you 're completely done playing , you 're going to loosen it all the way because you want the hair to kind of fall gently .but , again , you do n't want to loosen your hair too much because if you start loosening it you 're actually going to start taking your bow apart .when you , typically , get your hair changed what they do is they loosen your hair completely. [CLS] [SEP]and then they replace it like that .
and i 'm here to answer the question how do you find out about the penalties for shoplifting .well , shoplifting is the act of stealing merchandise from a retail store or other type of shop .what constitutes shoplifting and what the penalties are is going to vary from state to state and sometimes from municipality to municipality .so , you 're going to want to check your particular states. [CLS] [SEP]statutes dealing with shoplifting and the counties in which you reside and what their statutes are .perhaps the best one to consult with to know what the particular penalties are going to be for this particular charge of shoplifting is a criminal attorney that specializes in this area of law .someone who has dealt with shoplifting in the area in which the person was charged , that knows what the judges are doing in that particular area .i 'm robert todd and thank you for watching .
and just like the other octaves we 've already learned , for the a octave , when you 're playing the a octave , again you want to hear a nice ringing sound .you can play the a string with the a note on the e string , like this .and you 'll know when you 've hit that , the a note on e string. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's in tune because you hear a little bit of a ringing sound underneath , just like the other octaves .you could also play the , again just like the other octaves , play the a string with the a note on e string together .and that is the a octave and again , you can practice that just like the other octaves , it will help you not only tune , but also help you play in tune .
today i 'm going to show you how to change a flat tire .there 's only about one tool that you need to change a flat tire .and that 's just a tire lever .yeah ,you need at least one , up to about three .depending on how tight the tire is .usually you can get away with using just one .the first thing is , you want to start opposite the valve stem .insert the tire lever under one half of the tire bead .and you should then be able to just slowly pry it off .kind of unzip it all the way around , ending back opposite the valve stem .at that point , you should be able to reach inside that tire and remove the flat inner tube .and then you can grab a new inner tube , or either try to patch the flat one .but the next step to reinstalling it is going to be to inflate the tube with air , just to give it some shape .and then you 'll start opposite as in removal .and insert the stem into the hole in the rim .and then tuck that tire , or the inner tube up into the tire all the way around .and then starting at the valve , begin to reinstall the other half of the tire bead .being careful not to pinch the inner tube in between the tire and the rim as you work the bead back on .and you want to end up opposite that valve stem , so that you have the most slack in the tire to allow you to pop the last little bit back on .the trick is not to use any tools when you pry this last bit back on .otherwise you 're running a high risk of pinching the inner tube .you should be able to do it , just by working it on slowly .and there you have it .you can then just inflate it to , you know , recommended inflation pressure .which should be marked on the outside of pretty much all tires .that 's how you change a flat tire .
as he goes into strike , he has to make sure that he punches me in the stomach .one of my worst pet peeves is when people punch out here .i do n't care if he punches out here .i do n't care if he punches out here , if he does that all day long , all he 's doing is fanning me .it 's making me cool off .so he has to punch like he 's going to make me see my lunch .as he does that , i do my tenkan motion that we talked about in the very beginning , this turning motion .so as he strikes , i tenkan , control this wrist , and bring him back around .principle of dynamic reversal .it 's a bad spot to turn someone right around into this , because you 're giving him momentum to strike you with .if you watch his other hand , boom , he could really clean your clock from here .so you have to maintain control of this wrist from the very beginning .one , two .from here , kotegaeishi , like i talked before , is not a wrist lock out to the side , like this .a lot of styles like aikido you 'll see a big huge wrist lock , which gives it a really pretty fall , it looks very impressive on camera .but in reality , it gives him a lot of opportunity to punch , or to just knock my hands off , and put me in kotegaeishi myself .so instead we keep our kotegaeishis very small , and you 'll see from the next one i control the entire body with this .you 'll also see , i moved right into the pin that i discussed before .extending the shoulder into the ground , maintaining control , i 've got my entire workspace laid out before me .i used to do this technique to pin to the outside , but if he starts to move away , it 's too easy for me to lose that .so from here , i 've got him pinned here , and if he starts to get away , i can transition into a strike , to a head grab , to a knee drop , anything that i need is right here at my feet .control the arm , step away .
( playing guitar ) please see the next video in this series for the next segment of impetu .
the last one i 'm going to show you is the read mode .now the read mode is very , very important because of the fact that it allows you to use it .if you do n't have the read mode on you 're not going to be allowed to even view it .if it 's off all the automation that you recorded. [CLS] [SEP]will still be there. [CLS] [SEP]it 's just not allowing it to perform itself .so what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to change this whole thing to read now .so now once i have it on read any automation that i just recorded. [CLS] [SEP]is now going to be read by the computer. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to work .it 's going to keep on moving. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to allow you to view whatever you had just recorded as far as volume , any panning , any type of sends. [CLS] [SEP], you know what i 'm saying .these are all things that can be effected by the automation .you can view all this automation by changing your track view button on your pro-tools tracks .within each track you can choose which thing to view and you can view different automation , and control your automation with these faders or these encoders .this is going to help you a lot when recording your tracks because these are real tools that help you like tweak your sound , you know what i 'm saying .back in the olden days they did n't have digital things that could do this for you so. [CLS] [SEP]what you had to do was do everything by hand .to move faders at the same time people had to use pencils and move faders at the same time .now everything is digital , automated and now you can do a lot of special things .so it 's good that you learn these and take advantage of the technology today .
and we are going to go over. [CLS] [SEP]break it down .so a really easy step and this is another little toe step like we have been doing with some of the other ones but with this one you are going to have a little bit more bounce in your upper body .so with this one you are going to start forward , you 'll come forward , you bring your foot up , you bring it down , then you 'll bring this one up. [CLS] [SEP]and you 'll bring it down. [CLS] [SEP], so you 'll come boom , here , boom , here , boom , here .so again , you are here , boom , here , boom , here , boom , here , boom up .so as opposed to the other ones when you were doing this , but with this you are using upper body , you are bouncing that way you want to bounce boom , up , boom , here , boom here. [CLS] [SEP]so with that last one you can turn up. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to turn your body this way and start over again. [CLS] [SEP]or you can bring your body this way and change your direction so you can just go here up down , up , here , up , down , up , change , boom , boom , here , boom , here down , up. [CLS] [SEP]and then you can just come back that way and change the direction. [CLS] [SEP]but every time you are doing it you want to really look like you 're breaking it down. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's your break it down .
when you play this game , you '' ll find that you can win it regularly enough .so i 'm going to submit that there can be a special rule to make things more difficult .regularly when we play baroness we have five cards up , and it 's five columns or stacks .and let 's say that i am in the middle of a play and i have this situation .i 'm stacking this a little bit .in this situation i can move this eight to this five , that 's thirteen , and move those two cards of to the foundation , off the tableau to the foundation .now with regular rules you 're allowed to fill these gaps .if you fill these gaps it makes it easier because you have more cards to choose from when you 're trying to make thirteen .to make things harder you can have a rule that you can not fill these gaps with cards from the tableau .you have , with a special rule you have to play like this .so you 're saying , blank spots , if you will , can only be filled with cards from the stockpile and not the tableau .if you play it that way it makes it more difficult .
first thing we 're going to do is add some ice to a glass here .and we 're going to do one shot of gin .here we are .one shot of gin .follow that up with one shot of creme de cocoa .just how alexander likes it , the original .and finally , we 'll do about a shot of cream .okay .mix all the ingredients .mix it up real good .this is the original .this is not alexander .this is not alexander number two .evidently , this alexander existed before any other one .got it all mixed up , nice and frothy .glass is ready .pour it in .and look at that .alexander , original .bottoms up .
now , in this clip i 'm going to talk to you about a particular procedure called a testicular biopsy .now , when we perform a testicular biopsy is when a patient comes in and they might have several signs and symptoms of a possible suspicion of having testicular cancer .so the first thing we do is to order a testicular biopsy .now you think , `` what is this procedure ? ''well , here is a diagram .first of all , what is the definition of testicular biopsy ?well , basically it 's a simple , surgical procedure to remove a piece of tissue from the testicle .here you could see a diagram-picture of the testicle , and here 's a diagram of the testicle .here 's the testicle , the penis gland , and the testicle sitting in the scrotal sac .and here is a picture of the incisional sight .so for example , here is one of the testicles .if we suspect that the testicular cancer , or the tumorous mass , is within this testicle , we then do the incisional cut along this sight here .so , what is the procedure ?well , basically what we do is make an incision in the skin of the scrotum , and then we use a fine needle , or we use we use a very fine pair of scissors , and we actually snip out a small portion of the mass from the testicle itself .we then examine this mass tissue , little piece of tissue from the testicle , under a microscope to determine whether we see any cancerous cell growth at all .this simple procedure , called the testicular biopsy , which should could be done very simply either in the doctor 's office or in the clinic in the hospital .
hello , mark bowers from bowers photography , bowersphotography.com .i 'm in utah .we 're here to talk about difference , or digital photography and the difference between digital photography and film .the biggest difference is more precise and. [CLS] [SEP]many times we use a precise meter to get the light a little bit closer than with film .film had a little more forgiving latitude .you 're going to look for a really decent light meter or maybe a flash meter .film is beautiful and it 's great , but we 've shifted our whole studio now to digital .the lighting is basically the same with the same key light , fill light and hair light as with film .you just want to be a little bit more precise. [CLS] [SEP]and there 's one more thing that you should be concerned about with digital , is digital. [CLS] [SEP]is a lot more sensitive to color balance and color changes in your light .so you need to be aware of the color temperatures .film you can balance it just a little bit easier , but digital is a little bit more sensitive .
today 's topic is how to choose the right tire , for winter driving .most cars come with a tire , that look like this .they have just a nice tread on them , and not very much aggressiveness .this tire has a little more aggressive tread on it .it 's better for winter driving , and there are tires with more aggressive tread than this .the way to choose the proper one , is to figure out where you are driving from .do you drive in town only ?are the streets plowed very well ?do you have a lot of snow ?if you 're in a place where there 's a lot of snow , you 'll want a very aggressive tire .maybe even one that has the holes in it , where they put studs in the tire , for ice .if you do n't do much highway driving , or areas where there 's not so much snow , an all terrain tire is probably the best .if you 're in an area where there 's a lot of snow , you might want to put the very aggressive tire on , which are more aggressive , and more aggressive , and this one is n't that very aggressive , but it 's a different type of tread .your dealers , most people who sell tires , can find out the proper tire for your car , according to your driving conditions .ask questions .do n't be ever afraid to ask a question of how you drive , and let them know how you drive and where you drive .this will give you the proper way to get the right tire , for your car .
and you do n't want to any , the kids or whoever maybe walking by to trip over anything .so , it 's good idea to always pick up once you 've done the job , or at a certain stage of that job .i like to do it , of course , throughout the job because it 's much easier to work and stay organized that way .
there are many different variations of snake arms .they go from absolutely large , huge slow snake arms to a little bit smaller .we are going to go over a low snake arm .sometimes the upper movements will hurt your shoulder. [CLS] [SEP]so you want to make sure that you are not bothering your shoulder in this movement .you can also refer to our arm drills to help to train your body for this movement as well .so we are going to start with our elbow .the elbow is going to lift up and the wrist is going to lift up .then the elbow is going to drop .then the wrist is going to drop .the elbow is going to go up , wrist up , elbow drop , wrist drop .now , the beautiful part of this move is in the transition from here to here .so you want to make sure your elbow is coming up and. [CLS] [SEP]then you ?re rolling down here .now watch the hand , make sure the hand does n't fly around .our palm is facing in and then the palm is facing out , as if your brush your fingertips along the wall .up and down , and you want to drill with both arms .up and down , again elbow , wrist , elbow , wrist .elbow , wrist , when you add both arms together. [CLS] [SEP]that 's the tricky part .so you want to drill each arm separately before adding them together .one , two , switch ,three .practice in front of a mirror. [CLS] [SEP]so you can really watch yourself and make sure your doing them correctly .
see that little blue edled it has a channel that the string that is driven resides in .and there 's two string guides in each side so that fits on there like that. [CLS] [SEP], see where that led is it 's driven that string .the led is n't driving the string. [CLS] [SEP]it 's an electric magnetic force inside the unit that strives the string .the led access , the guide and. [CLS] [SEP]i can switch from string to string. [CLS] [SEP]cause i have string guides and the outside string take more of a challenge to master the technique .because there 's only one string guide it has a two position switch ; one for the fundamental harmony , and one for the upper harmonic .see there 's the fundamental and you can make your notes swell and volume , you can control the volume by getting it close to the pick up .then you can back it up a little bit like that you can let it rise up. [CLS] [SEP], can you see that , and you can control how much strive you want .you can add some brightness to that pick up and changes character completely .
it 's a pose that is oftentimes done incorrectly because of improper alignment which can really bother your shoulders .so when you can use a strap , it can really put you in a perfect alignment , and i recommend to anybody , no matter how perfect your chataraunga dandasana. [CLS] [SEP]maybe , to try it this way just to make sure you 're in the proper alignment .so you 're going to make the strap into a little circle that 's just fits right above your elbows .so we 've already made this for faith. [CLS] [SEP]so she 's going to come and put this on right above her elbows .yeah .and she 's going to hold it tight just like that .she 's going to come forward and place her hands down right under her shoulders .good .and then she 's going to extend her legs back and come up into plank pose .she 's going to lift way up on her toes and bring her weight forward , crown of the head forward , and then bring this strap right underneath and right along the bra line .good .and she 's just going to lay in that like a hammock .now , you need to notice that her wrist and elbow are in alignment .so you have to bring the elbow forward. [CLS] [SEP]and what most people do is shoot their elbows back. [CLS] [SEP]so their wrists are way forward of their elbow .you want to bring that elbow forward. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to make sure your shoulders are no lower than your elbows .what most people try to do is bring their shoulders way forward and this can cause rotator cuff issues , all kinds of bad problems .so you want to keep your shoulders rotated back and down .good .and so then faith can just lower right to that point. [CLS] [SEP]and then bring her weight forward and come right up into your up dog .good .so just resting in the hammock of the strap can improve the alignment of your chataraunga dandasana .it 's also safe to do if you do have any shoulder issues .
the bottom crease should line up along the bottom edge .then you get a nice corner fold there and repeat it on the other side matching those creases .it is going right at where the two folds bisected , you fold the corner up. [CLS] [SEP]and then you fold each corner in to get a nice corner finish .now i 'm going to put a little bit , you can put glue or a little bit double stick tape to hold this edge down .you can put it the whole length if you want , i just put it in the center to hold it .okay !now we would place our card , this is a quarter fold card that was out of a eight and a half by eleven sheet of paper in a quarter fold card .place this on this. [CLS] [SEP]so you know it is going to fit and fold the card up and crease that well .push down , get it a nice firm crease , and then we are going to fold down the top of the envelope and get a good crease on that also .now if you like at this point we would open it up and just trim this edge here .we are going to cut here to here just to trim it up , you do n't have to. [CLS] [SEP]but it just gives us a little bit nicer look on both of those corners .
now we are going to show you some more right hand stuff for the key of c.we are going to go back to the major progression doing a 1 , 6 , 2 , 5. [CLS] [SEP]and we are just going to really focus on the right hand .now when you are going to make melodies , it is all about space and timing so. [CLS] [SEP]see i have the same quality. [CLS] [SEP]but it is looping .leave a little space , a little more space and it is the space and time you get in between notes that really gives the importance .now here some people who try to improvise and ah and it is lot of notes and it sounds nice. [CLS] [SEP]but there is no umph to it .you know it does n't have the soul. [CLS] [SEP]so you want to really the more simple you can make it the better .a little chromatics there .i like to use a lot of pentatonics too which is 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 gives it that nice happy overtone .you can put flat third in there , blues note .so in the key of c , you can see the blues notes are these notes right here .it 's half of the root of 2 and the bottom of the group of three .
the splatter shield is good for a number of things .first the title splatter would make you think that it 's going to keep everything inside this is n't always true although it helps a great deal .one of the best things it 's for is when you 're incorporating ingredients while the mixer is already on .so if you 're whisking something you can just pour your ingredients in while it 's mixing. [CLS] [SEP]and you do n't have to worry about them traveling to far a field .this works much better with liquids than with using flower or sugar other drier ingredients have a tendency to still be able to kind of splatter a bit .cause they are more of a powdery texture which it 's still going to come up. [CLS] [SEP]but if you 're using adding liquid ingredients this could be invaluable .you can see how this is caught splatters of the water on the edge. [CLS] [SEP]so this is what you are trying to avoid and getting that out .however if you are adding in dry ingredients after liquid they are probably going to stick to your splatter shield .so while it 's useful for many things. [CLS] [SEP]it 's not a cural. [CLS] [SEP]and you still have to take into account what you are adding and how fast your mixer is going before counting on the splatter shield to keep everything inside .
transparency paper comes in two styles , one for inkjet printers and one for your color printers .all you do is you 're going to use that as your paper .you put that in , you 're going to copy your grid paper onto it .now once you get your grid paper onto your transparency paper then you 're going to take your picture , put it underneath , put it through the copier again .you 'll now have your picture gridded out. [CLS] [SEP]then you just take your colors , choose them .an easier option is to go online .many companies online , you send them your favorite photo. [CLS] [SEP], they 'll send you back a printed pattern with the colors and everything you need .and that 's how you use your transparency paper .
alright .something that 's really important to remember. [CLS] [SEP]; as we 're going to move on , we 're going to repair this relationship , we 're presenting these solutions that we 're going to try out to try to save this relationship ; a very , very , very important word for you to remember is : affirm .and this may mean changing your whole relationship schema .but it 's very important , in order to repair a relationship , that you affirm each other .any strategy of relationship repair will only succeed if there are affirmations .and what affirmation is is positive talk versus negative talk .you 're implementing something .i want you to be more affectionate .so when that person is affectionate , you need to affirm that .i really like the way. [CLS] [SEP], i really like this. [CLS] [SEP], i appreciate that versus that 's no good when you do that , that stinks .get rid of the negative talk .replace it with affirmations and positive talk .
now , on our azalea , we have both of our petals folds completed on either side , what we 're going to do is we 're going to right here ,on the back piece here , we 're going to fold it right along this edge here of this petal fold .what we 're going to do is we 're going to take it and just make sure that it 's going to be straight .right there , like so .just open it back up .you can see there 's our crease there .do the same on this side here .fold it over and crease it .i 'm going to just take and valley crease this part here .meaning , pushing it down deep in there .there we go .you 've go the complete kite shape like so .what we 're going to do is we 're just going to unfold everything we have just done .there 's our pattern .you can see what our pattern looks like .we 're going to go into the next step , which is going to be a lot of fun .
very , very important as a wide receiver , as we break the huddle and we run to the line of scrimmage , we identify where the free safety 's at , where the corner 's at , so we have some kind of idea what coverage they 're in .we 're not going to know exactly , but we 'll have an idea .next , we never want to tip which way. [CLS] [SEP]or we never want to indicate or give away which way the plays going .our eyes are always forward , right , our outside foot is always back , and our hands are always in the go position , which means they 're up here , ready to go .one of the things that everyone does on offense except for the receiver is listen to the cadence .not true with receivers .we watch the ball .so our eyes are forward .as soon as we hear the cadence we turn our head , we watch the ball .when it 's snapped , that 's when we go .
some people add another term to it , the stiff legged one legged dead lift .it is with a bent knee. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's not a straight leg .these are important tips that we 'll go over as we do it .first thing , you have to be able to balance on one leg .if you ca n't balance on one leg , do n't do this exercise .one leg is going to be up a little bit behind you , the standing leg is bent .you 'll see i might wobble a little bit during this , you need to be able to balance on one leg .we 're going to come over , bending the knee enough that we can keep our lower back fairly straight .come down , if you can to touch the floor .notice my knee is bent , i 'm not trying to do it from up here. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm down here , and then you straighten up .okay ?maybe touch your foot lightly to the floor just to check your balance .bending over to touch the floor , straightening up .i 'd say do all your repetitions for one leg first then switch legs , rather than switching legs each time .if you get more advanced at this. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to add some weight , you can bring a weight into the picture .this is a kettlebell , some people do n't have this , you can do it with dumbbells .i 've even held plates , weight plates in my hands .typically , you 'd grab the weight with the opposite arm of the leg you 're standing on .we grab the weight , back is relatively flat , and we stand up with it .other arm is used for balance .again .a couple reps here .you can set the weight down for a second to check your balance .this is an exercise that really works a muscle called the gluten medius , which is helpful for balance .works your hamstrings , works you lower back , works the whole area we call the posterior chain .that 's about it .that is the stiff legged , one legged dead lift done both with weight and without .this is a kettlebell , basically a cannonball with a handle .this is the type of weight. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm choosing to use in this exercise .you can also use a normal dumbbell .you can also , if you have weight plates like you would put on a barbell , you can use them too .you just hold them from the side. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 've got your weight .
now that the lip liner is on , we are going to do lipstick and lip gloss .we can get really funky here .you can get a really cool deep rich color or something brighter .i am going to use this glitz gloss .it is like a fuschia , burgundy color and it has a glitter to it .it is not highly pigmented , but i am going to use a deeper lip gloss on top of it , so i am going to do a mixing action .but it will give a really cool look to the lips , especially with the burgundy lip liner and her pink hair .it will look really neat .and it definitely has that glitter to it and will definitely glam the look up. [CLS] [SEP]and that is what we are going for , the retro glam look .so , you just want to basically put it all over the lips .you ca n't mess this up .and just blend , blend , blend and more and more , depending on what look you want .and at this point , i am going to add a tiny bit more of the lip liner to accentuate it a bit more .that looks fantastic as it is , but i want to funk it up a tiny bit more .so i am going to use a bit of a gloss , kind-of like a deep grape gloss , then again , go right on top .i am going to keep it more in the pucker , pout area .exactly where she would pucker is where i am going to keep the gloss .she has nice bigs lips. [CLS] [SEP]so we do n't have to put a tremendous amount of gloss on since the lips are nice and big .and there we go .
as you begin to play golf , the golf spikes on your golf shoes , are going to wear down , over time .i 'm jared garbett , with echo farms country club , and i 'm going to teach you how to change your golf spikes .you 're going to take a spike tool .you can get them at any pro shop , or most of the time , your local pro shop will change the spikes for you , if you ask them .you 're going to take your tool though , and insert it into the two holes , in the golf spike .you 're going to press down , and twist it out .the old spike , you can just do away with .then , you 'll get a new spike to replace it .you can begin the spike into the hole , with your hands .you 'll gently twist it in there , and it will click into place .you 're going to want to use your tool again , though , to lock it down .you 're going to twist it to the right , until it clicks three times .after that , the spike is locked in , and you 're ready to keep on playing golf .you always want to make sure you have fresh spikes on your shoes , so you do n't slip , whenever you 're swinging , and that is how you replace your golf spikes .
now my horrendously ugly frog here this is how he is going to look at the end .except we have problems with his head up here .we need to solve that so what we are going to go is kind of kind of just press this down just a little bit .we need to expand it. [CLS] [SEP]so this is the fun part of the frog .you take this end here. [CLS] [SEP]and there you go. [CLS] [SEP]blows him right on up .a little bit more there he is .just kind of push that down in there. [CLS] [SEP]and there is your little frog .let 's work on this guy a little bit more .if you want to , you can reverse fold back down this top part here which would help that a lot which is why we have our handy dandy chopstick here .there we go and let 's see if he comes out any more .close enough .
ok , now we 'll cover three-two song clave with tumbao , on two drums .notice when i play it , that i will immediately go to the low drum , on the three side of the three-two song clave .the opposite of the song two-three clave .so , i will play it , and then count out the clave for you .here we go , i 'm going to count out the three-two song clave and play the tumbao .ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah .ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah .notice that i went immediately to the three side , to the low drum , on the three side of the clave .once again , let me demonstrate the two-three song clave , versus what we just did with the three-two song clave .ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah .ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah , ah .that 's traditional two-three song clave , low drum on the three side of the clave .so we covered three-two song clave , and two-three song clave .tumbao on two drums .
okay , a nice filler flower to compliment the tulips is babies breath .it 's like a classic combination .nice and springy .just take the babies breath .break it off into little pieces like this. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's got just enough length to be sticking out beneath the heads of the tulips .and then what you want to do is cut each stem. [CLS] [SEP]so you have a little point on it again and just slip it in between the tulips like that .make sure you 're getting it in the water .again you always want to make sure you 're cutting the stems just before you put them into water because they start sucking air. [CLS] [SEP]and if you put them immediately into water they start sucking water. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's the best thing for fresh flowers and for keeping them fresh .so again you 're just going to take your babies breath. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to go in between the babies. [CLS] [SEP]breath like this. [CLS] [SEP]and just sometimes you have to wiggle it through , it does n't go in as easily .but you cut your stems and tuck them in and just keep going around like that until you get ...you can add as much as you want .sometimes it looks pretty with a lot of babies breath .just depending on the flower. [CLS] [SEP]but this is tulips. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's nice and springy looking .and we 're just going to keep going and filling in between the blooms and give it a nice fresh springy look .and that 's how you accessorize your tulips with a filler flower .just like that .
shake your can very gently and slowly go back and fourth across inside .let is settle you can tell it 's settle. [CLS] [SEP]you will see the little sparkles or the little water drop lites on your shirt , once you 've done that on the inside your going to take the shirt and iron it on the outside .you 'll heart the crisp as you iron , once again you 'll hear it as you iron and there you go .
she took them to decorate a stand at an expo because she sold beauty cremes and she took the bottles to kind of brighten up the stand and get some attention. [CLS] [SEP]and she found that people came and were attracted to the bottles and eventually she noticed that they were choosing bottles that matched in their own auric fields .because she could see energy .so she to kind of learn why do they match .the aura soma is an ongoing , it´s a living system , it´s an ongoing process , a discovery what it´s even about. [CLS] [SEP]and she has sinced passed on in 91 and mike boot is now carrying on her work in england to bring aura soma to the entire world and we have practitioners in every contry , just about .
i 'm debbie rob --hi , i 'm debbie `` the roboteer , '' and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm here for expert village .we 're having so much fun making. [CLS] [SEP]this wire sculpture lizard the way sandy calder taught me out of one big piece of wire .so it 's like a giant safety pin that 's really strong , and it has all sorts of tensile strength and kinetic energy , which means that it really can move .now , it will stand anywhere and you can put it in any position .it could be like godzilla and stand up on its back feet or do whatever you want .but right now , what we want to do is complete the head .and what i 'd like to do is wrap it up the neck. [CLS] [SEP]and you could pass these eyes , and we 're going to go around the head just a bit , because what i want to do , as the very last thing , is to make a little mouth here with a forked tongue .to make a forked tongue -- here is where we 're finally cutting this big piece of wire .let 's see .i want this one .this is a wire cutter .i 'm going to cut the wire , then i 'm going to take it. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to fold it like this , and now you need to fold it back one , then squish it and pull it into place .now , we have a lizard with a forked tongue .
this is an easel .and , the technical term for this easel is called a speed easel .and essentially , it is because it is pretty fast and easy to use .these cutouts here are for the size paper that i will be printing with .i lay my paper down .i lift up the top .i close it. [CLS] [SEP]and i am good to go .this side is the eight by ten side .again , fast easy to use .i suggest most people that are beginning use this type of easel .it is very , very easy to use .behind me , is an easel that you can get much more precise with your crops , how you want your print to look .and , this is called a bladed easel .and , it has four blades on it. [CLS] [SEP]and you essentially register the size of print you want to make .this easel can make up to an eleven by fourteen print .the other easel can only make up to an eight by ten .and , it is a little bit harder to use to essentially register your print .when i first started , i had a harder time using this easel than anything .but , i eventually figured it out. [CLS] [SEP]and i love it .closes down , keeps my paper flat .
so now , we 're going to start adding in the bass drum a little bit to our jazz pattern .the most important thing i can say about the bass drum is , this is n't rock , we 're not playing .....that 's not the sound that we want .we 're not slamming down on the bass drum by any means .in fact , with jazz , sometimes playing the bass drum as quietly as possible is what we want to do .it 's called `` feathering '' , just to create a little bit of low end in our pattern .so , i 'll start playing the jazz pattern. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to play the bass drum on quarter notes , one , two , three , four , just like i did with the snare .i 'll play quietly , then a little bit louder , but i 'm not going to be slamming down the bass drum at all .( plays ) so as you can see , it 's possible to play the bass drum really , really quietly , and a lot of times in jazz , that 's really. [CLS] [SEP]what we want to try to do .so , play around with playing quarter notes on the bass drum .you can even start very quietly , and increase the volume , but at least keep in mind in most jazz situations , that 's not a sound you 're going to hear very often .
the key to security is to make your house harder than your neighbor or the guy down the streets house to break into .what happens is if he takes a look at your house and sees that it is going to be tough , he moves on down the street to find a little easier house to work with .we are going to talk a little bit about the security cameras and the lighting and there is a lot of different things that you can do .some of the drastic measures are bars on the windows .you know security door on your house where you 've got the steel framed door .i found generally just a few deterrence is enough to make people move on to the next house .one of the things is a security camera .security camera system has gotten to be very simple , very easy to set up and quite economical .this system here not counting the vcr itself , i believe this ran about $ 50.00 .it 's not a real expensive system .now this is a wired system. [CLS] [SEP]so it takes a little bit to use it .you know you actually have to run the wires. [CLS] [SEP]but they make wireless cameras too. [CLS] [SEP]that are a little more money and a lot easier to set up and just anybody who is a little bit handy can put one of these systems in .the beauty of it is you can be sitting and watching tv and in this case you see the guy and your bike is sitting in the driveway and nobody is messing with it .there is about a million different choices you can go with on these .basically i would say go with the best camera your budget will allow .
alright folks , in this clip i 'm going to teach you how to draw a sweep .knock some guy off his feet .and , this page is really starting to look like quite a brawl , so i will move down here to this unused corner and draw the sweep right down there .alright folks , and. [CLS] [SEP]what i did , is i actually sketched out the pose in pencil , the rough dimensions of it beforehand. [CLS] [SEP]so i would know where i wanted everyone to be .and , first we 'll start with the attacker , and we 'll draw him in a karate pose , down low , and his leg sweeping leg will be kind of coming out like this .and , you 're going to want to make sure you draw the heel like that. [CLS] [SEP], so we know that this foot 's facing that way , and his other leg which is not the focal point , but yea , he still needs to have a lower leg .and , draw the motion path kind of coming up like that , to do the sweep .and , then we 'll draw the victim , kind of falling over himself this way ,like he just got knocked off his feet , which obviously what a sweep is intended to do .so , he 's kind of going to come , be up in the air , and you can draw him , you know , as an exaggerated airborne pose as you want to really .i 'm going to make it look like this guy really got knocked off his feet here .his body is completely airborne , flying like he just got knocked completely off his feet , and that 's the whole point of the sweep , to show that the leg 's kind of came up out from under him , and now he 's falling backwards and onto the ground .so , that 's the angle that you want. [CLS] [SEP]and obviously you 're going to add. [CLS] [SEP], this is just the rough design , you can add plenty of detail to it .but , the crouch down legs sweeping across motion path guy falling backwards is the key to drawing the sweep .
gliding swans double arm , arm circles .now for the gliding swans .if you 're not sure what that is .and you just happen to click on this one particular clip .or found it on line .you may want to look at that clip and get the technique , the proper technique .breathing and shoulder position and all of that .for the gliding swans .but the gliding is taken care with this piece of equipment .these are gliders .they come for , they may come for floor and for carpet .but if you do n't have that or you do n't want to go through the expense .you do n't need to .paper plates or styrofoam plates work just as good .put them in front of you , as you 're laying face down .you 're going to use the heel of your palm to press into the plate .so this will work well on carpet or on , on the floor .right now , on the floor , they 're working beautifully .when i lay down , heels together , toes apart .and pressing the legs together .want to position my arms or my , the heel of my palms , into the plates .also i extend my arms into the gliding .when i 'm going to do the gliding swan .keep the shoulders down , keep the head aligned with the rest of the spine .and i 'm going to take an inhale .as i exhale , i come up into the swan .now the double arm circles , is basically simultaneous .this is a challenging , very challenging move .bring it down .you do a few or as many as you can .but if you just , like i said .if you just found this clip , go back a little bit into the series .and take a look at the beginning .learn how to do the gliding swans .go into a circle .one single , before you do the doubles .this is very nice , once your back is strong and you need a challenge .this is not only for the back. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's also going to work your upper body .including your arms , specially your triceps .so do n't be afraid to try .you 'll look good and feel better .bye bye .
alright , now we 're going to put a little bit of glitter into amalia 's hair .i 'm just taking her clips out here .this is a really fun technique to do for kids , and going out trick or treating , halloween , just for parties .basically just get the hair ready , put a little bit of hair spray into the hair .and while it 's still wet you 're going to take your glitter , and just literally just drop it into the hair .it will stay there because of the hair spray .just literally put it all over , just drop it in .you can just brush it out a little bit if you want to .this is fun for going out at night , going to parties , this gives a little bit of a shimmer .if you want to , you can also get spray glitters that go right into the hair , or you can actually put aqua color right into the hair , paint into the hair with aqua color , and then go in it with glitter .and there 's lots of glitter hair sprays you can also use too .you can also use a color hairspray to put a base coat in and to make it darker , kind of like what we did with the girlactik where we had the darker base , and then put a light color glitter on top of it .when we come back we 'll do a little bit of body stuff , and we 're almost done .
what we 're going to do with the stability ball is put it right here behind our knees and then facilitate a reverse curl .the key here is to use the ball for passive resistance .so we 're going to be kind of pressing against the ball with our legs as we curl up towards the air , so. [CLS] [SEP]the ceiling .so you 've got just a small area to work here with the reverse curl .it 's a lower part of the rectus abdominis that you 're trying to focus in on .so again , put the ball between your knees and you 're going to drive it in with your heels , and lift and lower .again , make sure you 've got a good grip .try not to bring it out here , that 's different work .you want to try to maintain tabletop with knees over the hips .drive the ball in , curl and release .it 's not a big movement that you 're working with here -you 're working with a small range of motion here in this area , or at least trying to make it smaller .so just let your hands relax , shoulder blades , soft neck , inhale , exhale , curl and release .you can really hear and see me working there because it 's just a small movement that i 've got to control and squeeze this big cushion of air while i hold the contraction .work in to about 10 to 12 reps .
you want it to cook .you see how it 's kind of boiling ?i want you to let it boil for just a little bit .it 's going to pop up and boil .it 's important before you place your meat in here for it to do that , for it to go ahead and boil like that .there 's a couple of other ingredients that we 're going to go ahead and throw in there , but it 's after you put the picadillo , which is the ground beef and the pork .first , i 'm going to just stir this and let it boil again .before i place my other ingredients , i 'm going to get my meat. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to place it in there with the sauce and stir it .
hi , i want some ice cream , i want sweet cream with oreo 's .we crush the spoon in , make it all delicious .you 're going to catch it. [CLS] [SEP]and if you catch it , i 'm going to throw it to you. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to give it to you free .i 've been serving ice cream for about 6 months , they do n't train us with like tricks , unfortunately they show you how to do it. [CLS] [SEP]and we all develop our own skill based on how we feel comfortable with .like i usually hit like this. [CLS] [SEP]but that 's easiest on my wrist .i want you to step back a little bit , alright perfect !ready , one , two and throw ,yeah !i totally caught it !
ladies , that is really a tricky area for you. [CLS] [SEP]and i understand it because more often than not , the man is asking you for a date .and the reason i meant that gps , i think that direction is critically important .and the direction you want to take with this is going from point a to point b in a roundabout way .you want to use an indirect approach .it 's more important for you to ask a man what interest area he may have .it may be football. [CLS] [SEP], it may be hockey , it may be nascar , whatever it may be , chat with him a little bit about it. [CLS] [SEP]and then say , `` would you be interested in attending with me '' a place going to a sports bar or a nascar race or whatever it may be , a football game , and see how he reacts .if he reacts positively , then he may see you as a person that he 'd like to be around .and that would be a door opener .i think you 're looking more here for a door opener for what type of response and interest. [CLS] [SEP]there is as opposed to hitting it heavy duty up front .get what interest area he has and then proceed with him on that basis .then you can move in other directions .but kind of keep that door opener attitude , and i believe you 'll have more success in asking a man out for a date .this is dr. [CLS] [SEP]paul .may your fantasies of today be your realities of tomorrow .
this is another reason i did n't use the hard wood. [CLS] [SEP]so we are just using a standard charcoal but its all wood. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to use these smoke wood chips .these need to soak for about 20 minutes. [CLS] [SEP]so we are putting them on now before our fire gets going. [CLS] [SEP]and then we are going to go prep the food .all you need is a hand full or two , mix them up and that is fully enough. [CLS] [SEP]and now they just soak .
so i 'm continuing to work on the legs and to be using my forearm and elbow here .i am working on the outside of the leg here .it is a much stronger tool in many ways .i am kind of just kneading the tissue on the side of the leg .as you can see i leave my hand here as a base , the mothering hand .as you can see sara 's feet are just naturally turned in pigeon toed .that is the exact way you should be with her hands to her side .you can take your time with this , it 's nothing to hurry .in fact a lot of times the clients will say i wish you would have spent more time in that one area .after a while as a therapist here you realize those areas that need more work and almost every recipient will gladly take more time in certain areas that is needed .so as i am finishing up here for this section of the massage i want to kind of spread the energy and keep my energy in my palms and tossing any way chi that is not needed and also it is assuring the partner that at least for now it is coming to a close. [CLS] [SEP]so when we come back i 'll wrap up this section of the massage .
through all of our other segments we 've talked about the physical aspects of hitting the ball .we 've talked about your stance , stepping in the box , we 've talked about your hands , we 've talked about your head , talked about you know , where you need to be looking .we 've talked about actually getting your swing started .what we 're going to talk about now is the actual mental game ; thinking about baseball , thinking about hitting ; things like that .now , what we 're going to talk abut first is knowing your strike zone .very , very important , because you need to know your limitations ; what you can hit , what you can handle .again , strike zone ; just play your chest to roughly about your knees .again , you know , it varies whether you 're in little league , high school , college , you know , whatever , but that 's essentially the basic zone .now from this zone here , you also have a zone that goes this way , which is from this part to the plate to this part of the plate , seventeen inches .that 's essentially your zone .and again , because you have an umpire it 's subjective .he may give you a little bit more room from the inside , a little bit more room on the outside .it is , it 's going to vary from umpire to umpire .why do you want to know these things , why do you want to know , okay. [CLS] [SEP], this is a strike , this is not a strike ?well because , when the pitcher releases the ball , you have a split second .if you blink , you 're going to miss the pitch , so you have that much time to make a determination ; is this a strike ; can i hit it .that 's why before you ever step in the box you need to know this is from here to here. [CLS] [SEP]is a strike .from here to here is a strike .this will make you way make it a much easier to make those quick split second decisions , and that 's knowing the strike zone .
i mentioned that i 'm working on a glass palate here .the glass is placed into the box of my portable easel .this kind of easel is great for planer painting , as we mentioned .it 's also great for working on a small scale .working larger , i like a larger palate .i personally like a lot of room .but working on a small scale this works .also , with the glass i can clean it really easily in the middle of a painting process .disposable palates are great too .they come in sizes that will insert right into there .this is and ecl easel , one of a number of brands that combine the easel with the palate. [CLS] [SEP]and so that becomes a very portable situation that you can move around .they also make cigar box size easels that you can carry around with you and have a little smaller sized palate surface .and that 's pretty nice .this easel will expand down to here ...it will go up so that we can put a much larger canvas on here .this easel i got exactly because it will take up to a sixteen by twenty canvas really easily .so you can see how big a canvas that can go out to here easily .but it 's also very handy for the small size .and this easel comes with a tripod .so this tripod is very malleable .you can do all kinds of neat things .i can tip it back and forth .i can also , if i 'm on uneven ground , pivot it this way and that way .the legs extend , so i can put this out to a standing height .so for standing or sitting , it 's very adjustable .
hi i 'm brie .now we 're going to learn part two of salsa .now in part two we 're going to add a stylish move called the tap .it 's really important. [CLS] [SEP]ok , now watch me .one and two , tap .and you are going to tap with your right foot .tap .let ’ s try it again .one and two , tap .let ’ s try it from this angle .and one , and two ,tap .from behind , one and two , tap .from this side .do n't forget your arms .one and two , tap .and from the front .another thing do n't forget the hips .rolling your hips is very important in salsa for male and female .so you want to remember your hips and your arms .do n't forget to tap .one and two , tap .
the first move , traveling move , i 'm going to show you is just simply walking with a move .what you want to do is just simply walk , just nice and gracefully , nice and slow , or you can put a little bit more pep in your step , if you want to .and we 're just going to add to moves to it .so , when we walk , we can add just a little shoulder shimmy. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're just going to walk in a circle adding a shoulder shimmy .another thing you can do is just add a chest lift and walk , chest lift , chest lift , chest lift , chest lift , chest lift .you can add a snake arm and just walk and walk , walk , walk and walk .as long as your walking is done with intention and your moves are done with intention at the same time , it 's still going to come across beautifully .so any time you walk with a move , make sure you 're just doing it with intention .focusing more on what the move that you 're doing and this will get you from one place to the next place .this is just called walking with a move .again , you can do a little shoulder shimmy while you 're walking , chest lift , chest lift , chest lift , chest lift , chest lift , chest lift , snake arm , snake arm , snake arm .that 's walking with a move .
okay so now we have opened the vessel here the form and we 're ready to start raising the walls of this salad bowl .and we want a lot of water on our hands so that the clay does n't grab .you do n't want the clay to grab your hands , however you do n't want to get the clay overly wet because then it will get all soggy on you. [CLS] [SEP]and then it will lose shape and collapse the form .the general process is you are drawing clay from the bottom of the pot and you are pulling it up through the walls .you can see it kind of spirals up like that and we 'll keep doing this until we have gotten clay up into the walls of our bowl .now you can see that i 'm opening the shape up as i 'm going too because we are going to make a bowl out of this .if i were making a jar or something like that i would be bringing it straight up. [CLS] [SEP]but there we have brought up the walls of the pot. [CLS] [SEP]and now i am ready to shape the pot. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to do that next .
cutting it open it makes a nice little pocket and we 're going to spread the chumous in the techina .i put the chumous on the outside and the techina in the middle we take them and spread them on both sides of the pocket .the little pita pocket then we put the eggplants one eggplant , the falafel balls i made the falafel balls big. [CLS] [SEP]so only 3 fits inside .we 're going to put the salad on top. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 're going to put some more chumous and techina on top if you like french fries you can always add french fries to the sandwich or if you like it. [CLS] [SEP]more spicy you can put pieces of hot pepper .
for the feet you 're going to need 2 items .first off , you 're going to need some black socks , some good old basic black socks .that 's going to get it done for you .you can get these black socks in most convenient stores .our overall costume is going to be black .we 're going to be a black cat on halloween , so definitely get yourself some black socks .you may own some already .they 're certainly much more common than they used to be .as long as they 're not the really formal socks , which tend to fall down off your ankles within the first 5 seconds of putting them on .it 's going to great .you 're going to want some socks that are going to be staying up , so you do n't want the socks that end right on your ankle either .definitely up to your mid calf , because what we 're going to do is we 're covering up any flesh colored parts of our body so that we do n't have to put makeup over everything .in addition , shoes .any type of general black shoes will do .if you expect to be in a lot of slippery surfaces , i do n't recommend having a really flat bottom .slick bottom shoes are going to be slipping all night long .you can also of course the more industrial type of shoes like the tougher type of shoes .keep in mind , if you 're going for more of cat like look looking like a feline .felines are little more petite , a little more graceful , a little quite less clunky so to speak .definitely keep that in mind with your shoe choice .

m going to show you how to make cute little bag out of regular everyday fabrics .so the next step that we 're going to do is we 're going to sew our lining onto our bag .this can be a little tricky if you have a small bag like this because it 's very hard to position it under the sewing machine .what you want to do is you want to start sewing right on the outer , right where your seam is because that 's where you 're going to go back and forth .that 's where you 're going to start your stitch .and that 's where you 're going to go back and forth .and again , you want to make sure that you do have , because since now this stitch is going to go over the top of the outside of the bag , this again shows the importance of picking a thread that 's going to disappear in your fabric .the last thing you want is a colored thread line up at the top .pulling out pins as you go and holding your fabric straight .and this is probably the hardest part of the whole project , is keeping this hemline straight .ok .
now , the whole introduction to this song starts with bass .that 's the key signature or that 's the signature riff for the song that everybody recognize , but it 's for the bass guitar .when the actual guitar kicks in , we use an octave technique in which we use our index finger on the 12th fret , skipping this one or muting it out with our index finger. [CLS] [SEP]so it sounds like this .so it 's muted out .pinkie on the 14th fret of the g string .whenever i 'm doing an octaving technique or anything similar , i 'll always jam my pinkie into the strings .i do n't want to ring out .i use my thumb to meet the lower strings. [CLS] [SEP]so i could just go wild on the strings .that way , these two strings are the only ones that are ringing out and it gives a lot of beef to the sound that you 're producing .okay ?now , i 'm going to show you all the octave parts. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'm going to show you the bend between them ,okay ?the octave parts go -- with the bend , which i 'll show you later , down here .that 's just moving your octave part down a half step , down one fret .now , we move this same octave part down to the 8th and 10th fret and then down to the 7th and 9th fret .together , without the bend between them , it sounds like this .all right ?in the next segment , i 'm going to show you the bend and how to work it all together within the riff to make it complete ,okay ?i 'll see you there .
it 's dow here at the firehouse car wash.today we 're teaching how to detail your boat like a professional .it 's this segment what i want to cover is cleaning the carpets and the floors .of course , just like anything we 're going to want to start with is vacuuming the carpets .and i like ,really , there 's two tools that i like to do that .one is the claw , which goes and gets broad areas like that .the other is your crevice tool which you can swap out on the vacuum .and a good shop vac. [CLS] [SEP]or you know , vacuum shop will have that .that allows you to get around the nooks , the crannies , down in the crevices , and do a real good job .once we 've vacuumed it , then we have the ability to go through and either spot clean the carpet .now , a professional shop like ours , if the carpet is older , we 're going to take it and extracting a chain. [CLS] [SEP]and we go over every square inch of the carpet .it 's going to pull dirt , grime , grease , anything we 've got in the boat .sun tan lotions , things you 've spilled , you know , out of the carpets .a lot of these newer boats like this one , i love these features on these new mastercrafts , is the carpets actually pull right out .in one big piece , we can take them out the boat , we can wash them , we can hang them , we can hang them to dry .and then , we literally can carefully bring a hose in here and rinse the boat and rinse everything to the back where there 's a drainage , a drain back there and just flush all this all the stuff out .and dry it up real nice .then bring the carpet back in .but a lot of boats do n't have that option .so you 're going to need to clean the carpet in place .typically , you know , spotter , if you 're doing at home , with a little bit of with a towel , some degreaser you can spray it on it and that 'll take care of your carpets .
okay we are almost to our seam now. [CLS] [SEP]so we want to be checking to make sure that we are good and lined up and just pull that all the way through , there we go .make sure that you are lining up and see this one is running a little bit ahead so i am going to skip that one and go ahead and pull that through , okay now just like we did for the outside one we are going to hit the one that is right in front of it and pull it through .my yarn is coming apart , if this happens to you just go ahead and take it back , if your yarn comes apart you can really mess yourself up , so take it back to where you were , hit the one right in front of the seam and instead of skipping the seam we are actually going to hit it , mostly because it is on the bottom because the seam is on the outside. [CLS] [SEP]so we do n't want any spaces in here. [CLS] [SEP]we want to make sure this bag is good and strong and you are actually able to use it. [CLS] [SEP]and it is not just for decoration .now as you are going through here you want to hit all of these little top ones and just stick your needle through wherever it will go just to make sure it is connected and to loop it up .then stick your needle through the ones right after the seam on both sides .they may be a little tight but that is good , now we have that seam and you will see it flows across all the way where that seam is. [CLS] [SEP]and that is exactly what we want as it goes along the base and the face of our bag .
now we 're going to begin with skin care .this is the most important step other than removal at the end of the night .you need to take care of your skin .your makeup is only going to look as good as the skin underneath it .you want to make sure that you cleanse your face completely before you start your makeup .do n't do your makeup over your old makeup from the night before .just do n't do it .cleanse your skin completely .make sure all the makeup residue is off .once your skin is completely cleansed , then immediately apply your moisturizer .depending on your skin type , you can use an oil-free moisturizer .a moisturizer with an spf is good for daytime .she has a little drier of a skin type , so i 'm going to use a bit of a more moisturizing moisturizer just to give a little more hydration .apply it all over the face and even down the neck .do n't forget the neck .the neck is a very important part .around the eyes .you do n't want to put a ton on , but definitely make sure that you spread it evenly and that all parts of your face have moisturizer on it .it 'll just make your makeup go on a lot nicer too .then i 'm going to use a little bit of an eye cream as well , which i think is very important .just around the eye area .put a tiny bit of eye cream before you start your makeup .anything you put around your eyes will go on so much smoother and your eyes is where you see your age most often ,so you want to make sure that your eyes look fresh , young , and healthy .lastly , you want to put on a lip conditioner , especially if you 're using a lot of lip colors and especially in the winter .you want to make sure that your lips are very , very hydrated .rub your lips together .now we 're ready to start with foundation .
ok , now were going to talk about watering your compost pile .now here i have a nice barrel of water .and its spring water. [CLS] [SEP]i think i will wash my hands while i am at it .from all that compost its a little stinky .now what were going to is i have put compost inoculants in this water which is going to it. [CLS] [SEP]has micro organisms in the inoculants. [CLS] [SEP]it has nutrients in there to feed the micro organisms. [CLS] [SEP]so they have something to feed on while there getting established in the compost pile .so what were going to here is were going to take this old weed here and were going to do a little stirring .so were going to stir this barrel up .you can see the water is nice and clear right now when i get finished it will be all cloudy .now we stir it get a nice vortex going on .sucking in the energy of the universe as it vortexes down and then were going to take the watering. [CLS] [SEP]can and fill this up with some of this nutrient rich compost starter and if you do n't have compost starter , now were going to water the pile. [CLS] [SEP]but if you do n't have compost starter and you need compost starter .well you can contact me at chi of me at yahoo jb @ yahoo.com. [CLS] [SEP]and i will fix you up with some compost starter and we will give you that e mail address again later on .but its important that you water this compost pile and get it nice and wet .not to wet it should be wet like a sponge .not dripping which takes quite a bit if water and. [CLS] [SEP]you will want to come and water this compost pile if it is n't raining .periodically to keep it wet .this pile need watering just like. [CLS] [SEP]a plant needs watering .the micro organisms in here if it dries out will die and leave the area .this pile will invite a lot of worms and all the little bugs that feed on the micro organisms create a very juicy wonderful amendment to put in your garden to help feed your plants because i mean thats what it all about is making this compost to feed your plants .
the next four exercises i am going to show you are going to be down on the floor if you at the beach , you going to need a towel , if you are at home you can for this on the carpet .first exercise i am going to show you is for your blue muscles , it 's an exercise that is going to target those blues and it 's called the quardrop hit extension , you are going to get down on your hands and knees. [CLS] [SEP]i like to do this exercise on my forearms , however , you can start on your hands if you like ,whatever feels more comfortable for you. [CLS] [SEP]but , i am going to come down to my forearms and making sure you looking down towards the ground not looking up that put excess strain on your neck .from here once you are in your position i am going to have you bring your leg up. [CLS] [SEP], knees bent at 90 degrees , and relax that ankle , so when you bring your heel up pressing towards the ceiling , your heels coming towards the ceiling and you tightening and contracting your blue .bring you knee down to about 2 to 3 inches and repeat press up to the ceiling bring that knee down thinking about tightening , thinking about contracting your blue .now that is just one variation , now i 'm going to show you a straight leg variations as well .neck down to your forearms , straightening your leg and your flexing your ankle once again , lifting your heels towards the ceiling keeping you abdominal muscles tight , and lowering your toe down toward the floor , lifting up , lowering down. [CLS] [SEP], now this a great basic exercise for beginners , however , i do not recommend this exercise if you have back problems , back injuries , for it may place excess strain on your back if you already have pre-existing back conditions .
but , there are things that need to be considered when you decide to bunk down for the night .there are a lot of dangers that exist in the wilderness that can effect where you camp .for instance , the area that we 're standing in right now , if you look behind me , we have this wall of rock .and , one would have to be concerned that any loose rock could fall down if you were camped below , and injure or kill you .we have a ravine here that actually goes down into a slot canyon and runs out into a creek below .if you had a rainstorm , and a rainstorm does n't have to be right here , it could be four miles away , and the water could come down this ravine and a flash flood setting could be eight , ten feet deep , running fifty , sixty miles an hour .you 'd never escape it .you 'd never be able to get up the walls of this rock formation quickly enough .other things that you need to think about. [CLS] [SEP], you do n't want to camp under trees that have dead limbs in them , something that could fall out of the tree and land on your tent .they 've actually had people killed in that way .you want to take a look at the surroundings and make sure you 're not getting ready to sleep where you have signs of rodents or animals ,game trails .because if you have a lot of rodents around , you could find yourself infected with the types of diseases that rodents carry .so , you want to make sure that where you put your , your sleeping area is clean and clear of that sort of stuff .you want to make sure that you are n't crawling into a crevice or under a rock formation where maybe snakes could exist .a real danger there .if you find a cave or something that you want to go back into , throw a rock back in there , two or three of them .make sure that something does n't come scurrying out .in other words , take the time to make sure that the place you intend to sleep is going to allow you to sleep safely .you notice we 're on a hillside here above the lower areas , and that 's a good place often for a campsite .if you 're up on a hillside , those are going to be far less of a problem .they tend to like to be away from breezes and hillsides pick up breezes .another thing that you want to think about is water .if you find a water source , a small pond , or river , or a stream , it 's nice to be able to camp fairly near to that because you 're going to want to go back and forth to retrieve water .however , especially in the desert setting , do not camp too close to the water .animals like wild burros and big horn sheep will travel sometimes twenty miles just to get to a water source .and , if when they get there , you 're camped there .they 're not going to come around , and they 're going to leave .they could end up dying , or they may have to go another twenty miles to the second water source to get water .so , camp a least a few hundred feet away from the water source , so that you do n't threaten any animals who come down to , to get water .keep in mind also , if the animals come down for water , it 's a great place to potentially trap or kill an animal for food if necessary .
now we 're ready to do the temper part .ok.so , we 're going to hit it with straight phthalo green .and actually this is going to work better if we do wet and wet .so , cleaning out this brush. [CLS] [SEP]so i can leave the phthalo green on this one and just wetting the whole area .so you want to hit it , so that it 's just about full strength phthalo green .and i 'm going to have to add even more .
because they look a lot like a bank shot and they are actually lined up the same as you line up a bank shot .but , for serious pool players , they like to make a distinguishing difference between the two of them .in that a kick shot , to a pool player , means that your driving the cue ball to a cushion before it approaches an object ball , with a set up like this .so , if i drive this cue ball into that cushion , as such , to come over the hit that ball , then i 'm said to be kicking at it rather than banking it .so , it 's just a difference in the terminology .but , again , with serious players , if one of them is telling the other one , `` you need to play the kick shot here . [CLS] [SEP]''then that other player knows exactly what they 're talking about .it means drive the cue ball off of a cushion towards an object ball before doing that .but , outside of that , as far as how you determine where to hit the cushion , it 's just like a bank shot .so , if i wanted this ball to come in , this cue ball to come off that cushion over to here , i have to figure out my angles so that i get my contact point going in so that i try to get the correct angle coming out to pocket my ball .
the next step in our living room project is to re-assemble the ceiling we 've been working on .as you can see the tiles are dry .normally , i would recommend a second coat , and that goes for the lattice work as well and also for the wall , and the trim , but for the purposes of this demonstration we are just going to stick to one coat .so , let 's put these panels back up .again , be very careful because these things do crumble .it should just snap into place like that .ok , we are almost finished our how to paint a living room project .next i am going to show you how to clean up .
just sort of fan the pears out like a flower .french people seem to have a lot of fun with their food , that 's for sure .ok. [CLS] [SEP]so that 's fine like that , and the last thing i 'm going to put on..so we 've got bitter leaves , sweet pear. [CLS] [SEP], now we 're going to add some very sharp roquefort cheese , a french blue cheese .and that 's going to be , really , a nice creamy taste and will act as most of the dressing in fact. [CLS] [SEP]so we 're going to dress this quite sparingly .just some nice morsels of the roquefort right on top .some more for the second salad .ok , and now let 's make the vune dauget .
there are a couple of basic criteria that you should think about following whenever you are preparing your festival .the event should be in a location that is customer use .in other words , a place where people are used to going and do n't have to think about it too much .it can be a park , a street that is closed , it can be an indoor facility , somewhere that folks can get to and some place folks can get to easily .so think in terms of where buses run , where the parking is or is n't , way people can get there without people having to make a big effort .remember whenever you do your festival , other things are going to be going on at the same time. [CLS] [SEP]so what you want to do is make it as easy as possible for folks to attend .you also want to think in terms of electricity .is there power ?you want to think in terms of water .is there drinking water or not ?if you do n't have electricity , there are ways around that .we can get generators and we can figure ways to supply electricity .if you do n't have drinking water , it gets a little more complicated but it can be done .but if this is a first time through the process and you are looking at a site without drinking water , i would suggest find another location , but not to say it ca n't happen .so when picking your location depends i would say on the familiarity of the location that people are used to going to and having basic services power and water and a place for people to park or near public transportation .the next section we are going to go to is going to be permits .i will be discussing permits and insurance issues that are somewhat daunting for folks .stay with me .
so far i 've showed you how to quantize after you record data .usually if you 're recording certain piano parts and things like that you may want to keep like a realistic feel , so you might not want to quantize , but sometimes with drums and things like that it 's almost always necessary to quantize .especially if you are using electronic drums and you 're doing more of a style of music that requires more straight on timing .so , what i 'm going to show you now is the input quantize .the input quantize basically lets you quantize on the way in .so when you 're actually recording it , it 's actually going to record it fixed .it 's going to fix the time automatically for you .what you 're going to do is you 're going to go to midi and go to input quantize .once you 've gone to input. [CLS] [SEP]quantize this is going to set a quantize for you automatically .it 's going to have a filter and just quantize all the notes and set it at the right timing .just make sure that the `` enable input quantize '' is enabled .once this is enabled all your settings within here are going are going to affect your notes that you 're going to be recording .so making sure that everything is the way you want it and the enable is enabled .
the next really good point for the lower leg , especially in the knees is called dispersing point , or stomach 41.and that one is going to be right at the top of the hock .and this one is pretty easy to find , there 's usually not a lot of muscle in this area .and again , your finger you go down below the joint and your finger just sort of falls into that hole .it 's a very good point for the lower legs in general .it 's particularly good for arthritis , it 's a good spot to use the straight up and down hold .you can use thumb pressure , you can also do a circular motion , but it is a good one to use that steady hold on .and it 's one that will work really well for any kind of pain and stiffness especially in the back legs .so it 's one you can use in various points .again usually with knees the problem will be one sided , but it never hurts to do both sides if your dog is relaxed and comfortable. [CLS] [SEP]it 's a good idea to do both sides .it helps balance the legs as well especially if they 've been working one leg harder to favor the other .
i really want to take one bag .what we need to do is find a way to fit all of our supplies that we 're going to need in the bag .the biggest thing we need is our paper .one way to do that is to buy a binder like this one .some scrapbook bag will come with it .it has some dividers already and your papers just slide in between those dividers so that you can organize your paper by theme or by color .this divider is perfect for an 12x12 paper , and then you could also put your 8 1/2x11 in this binder .i like to keep my 8 1/2x11 paper separate , so i have a separate container .again , it 's got all of the dividers and i have my paper organized by color in the front .i had extra pockets , so i organized by theme in the bag .your stickers and other things fit in here as well .along with the binders , you can buy these plastic containers .they 're in search for the binders and they store die cuts , stickers , and all kinds of different paper embellishments that you 're going to need to scrapbook with .this is a great compact way to carry all of your scrapbooking supplies .
it 's very light weight .it uses wires and the king posts to give it. [CLS] [SEP]it 's structural bracing .which is a very light weight method of construction .much like bridges and the golden gate is suspended by and wires and cross bracing .light weight structure very strong .the more advanced gliders have gotten rid of all the wires up top and they 're called topless gliders .and so they have to have a much more heavy duty support inside .and that 's why the more advanced gliders weight a lot more .so we put the battens from longest to shortest .you want to dust the sand off so that you do n't sand out the batten pocket as you put it in .they 're attached with these strings back here .it 's very difficult to set it up incorrectly , it 's very straight forward .like a modern tent .it 's designed not to be set up wrong .it 's hard to set it up wrong .it takes about ten minutes to set it up .the next thing before i get to these , you see that the wings are down on the ground .we 're going to tension the wing , which pulls the cross bar .this big structural piece here that 's hinged there , pulls it back , tightens up the wings and makes into a strong air frame .to do that i just pull this guy back here and attach it here .these are called luff lines and the whole thing together is called the reflex bridle .reflex is the curve that comes back out of the wing .i 'll take one of these battens out and show you .it 's very much like up elevator on an airplane .this is what keeps this glider wanting to fly with its nose up and prevents it from just spiraling into the ground .this structure here , the reflex bridle , makes it impossible for this wing to come and flip inside out .this piece sits on a little knob right there in the wing , that i 'm going to line it up to .this is called a washout strut , and it 's designed again to keep the back of the wing up , to keep the nose of the glider up .i need to set the nose batten into place .so if she was n't holding the tail , the wind would come right under there and flip this glider over on top of me .ok , so the nose batten 's in place .jana 's set up the other wing .we need to check the glider over and make sure it was all put together .that 's called the preflight .
hi. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm patti german and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm a licensed marriage and family therapist here in new york city .in this clip we 're going to talk about how to do romantic things in your home .i think the most important thing about being in a relationship is sharing your time together and doing things together .the most arduous task can become a lot of fun and not as troublesome if you do it with your partner and you share the responsibility of it whether it be cleaning up the kitchen or vacuuming , or even painting a room .it is important to do it together and give each other space to feel safe in whatever you are doing where one person is n't controlling the other person and telling how everything should be done .it could be very very romantic to just be together in a room and talk and share each others ' thoughts and feelings without feeling judged and criticized .this is patti german in new york city .
so now i 'm going to show you a bunch of different ways to make handles for your batter bowl .anytime that your making something that requires an handle you can have a lot of fun and get really experimental .one of my favorite handles to make for a batter bowl is a braided handle and the way that i do that. [CLS] [SEP]is. [CLS] [SEP]i take a little bit of clay about a hand full like that .make it in to a rough cylinder. [CLS] [SEP]and then i roll snakes .just like when you were a kid .now the important thing when making a coil like this is to apply even pressure and to roll back and forth far enough that your getting a full round roll .if you do n't roll far enough if you just go back and forth back and forth. [CLS] [SEP]you 'll end up with kind of an oval shaped tube and for a braid. [CLS] [SEP]that ?s not going to work .so i like to get my coils pretty thin for this particular type of handle .that one ?s ready. [CLS] [SEP]and then i will just do the same thing to this one. [CLS] [SEP]and now i am ready to start making my braided handle .
the first thing we want to do is to steep the tea in the pot .we are going to use one tea scoop. [CLS] [SEP]and i am going to measure out 3 scoops of chai .depending on how much you are making , but i am making for actually several drinks , you might want to adjust the amount .next thing i am going to add to this , is sugar .it is going to be the same amount of sugar as chai .so 3 scoops of sugar .why you put sugar is because it is really going to draw out the flavor of the chai .so it is really an essential part of the drink .then we want to add hot water to this .so i am just going to fill this us with hot water .there we go .then we are just going to give it a little stir .really blend the sugar and the chai with the water .then we are going to have it steep for about 10 minutes .so it is going to be a really strong blend but not become too bitter .now to save time , i have already steeped some chai and put into this pitcher and kept it in the fridge .so you can actually keep this up to one or two days .so what we want actually to do is pour it. [CLS] [SEP]half way through the cup. [CLS] [SEP]so it has a strong flavor to it .we are actually going to use steam one to heat this up because it is cold right now .one important thing to do is not to let too much air into the chai when you are steeping it because it is going to become too bubbly .so you might want to put it half steamed because it is water based and is going to act a little different from milk .make sure you really clean the steam one. [CLS] [SEP]so you do n't taint your other drinks with chai .just going to place this here while we steam our milk .i am just going to steam the milk just as i was steaming for a latte .we do n't want it too foamy .just want to heat up the milk .we are done steaming our milk .next thing i am going to do is add cinnamon to the chai .that is because , just like the sugar , it is going to add to the flavor .i am going to use a little stirring stick or you can also use a spoon .blend the cinnamon carefully into the top of the chai .just so we do n't have any chunks .then we are going to pour the milk into the chai .give it a little stir .and there you go .that 's a really flavorful chai latte .
alrighty , then .we 've got our handle attached .and , we 're back outside and back to the angle grinder .now , i 've put another disk on this .this is a finer disk , so it 's going to make a little smoother cut .and , i 'm just going to grind down this a little bit .take some of the bark off .and , just kind of do anything i want .we 'll start the grinder up .and , what i 'm first going to do is just take little bits out .i 'm not going to grind for a long time .because , taking little bits out will gives us more contrast when we grind through the layers of bark .so , here we go with the noise and the dust .that looks pretty good .we 're going to sand it a little bit more .and , that should bring out some more of the wood grain .so , now we 're going to go our palm. [CLS] [SEP]held sander with a two-twenty grit .and , gives this a light sanding all over .
ok , so using the same brush you were just using to do the polka dots on the bandana , get a little bit more black. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to be creating an eye patch .so this is really fun .kids love this .so , just turn the head a little bit. [CLS] [SEP], kind of , you can make the eye patch however shape you want .i love the classic fold .just like a shield over the eye .now , you want to be careful with kids ' eyes , but you can get pretty close to them without getting in there .so , i 'm just going to draw right outside of it and then fill it in .i think this is probably the more popular faces among the kids after `` pirates of the caribbean '' came out .right over the eyebrow , nice and thick , filled in .now , continue filling in the face however thick you want the black to be .i usually like it a nice light black .keep their eyes closed .you want to be very careful and not get too close to any juices of the eye ; that 's never cool .so , alright .now you need the attachments of the eye patch , which you can just keep bringing back into the side of the head .and then go and pull into the bottom of the bandana like it 's coming out of and from the bandana .so , here you go .clean up any loose lines and you have the face mask of a pirate eye patch .so that 's just starting off .
so using kinds of rhythmic .and you do n't have to use the pedal to do that either. [CLS] [SEP], i just like to do that sometimes because i want to cut out certain aspects of the effect as i 'm changing notes or chords , but in this case , i can just leave it out .and you can get. [CLS] [SEP], you can also use your hand , like i 'm using my picking hand to kind of suppress the effect more , rather than using my foot .have a nice , almost orchestral sounding effect with my chords .
now , encaustic painting means melted wax painting. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's a very old ancient art form .the egyptians were doing it 2000 years ago and if you 're a traditional encaustic painter , you usually have a hot plate like a pancake griddle on which you put a whole bunch of pots , melt different colored waxes , dip brushes into it and begin to put very heavy layers of wax on usually a wooden board .then they will carve into that wax , put things into that wax , pour different colors into it and sometimes build up a quarter-inch thick of wax .i use a different method .i call it a european encaustic painting method that i learned from michael bossom in wales , and this is all done with hot tools .
the next step is to now develop a motion in the head , that 's very easy .so you want to start with the feet apart , drop your shoulders , and rotate your shoulders forward like that and keep your head very , very loose , very loose and try to bounce your shoulders down as the head stays down. [CLS] [SEP]yeah. [CLS] [SEP]and then your shoulders lift first , and then it follows like that .like a little wave almost .and we 're going to try that much to music so you can get it timed right .( music plays )our favorite song and you , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .( clapping ) one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .same rhythm. [CLS] [SEP], that 's where you find you base groove. [CLS] [SEP]and then you add that to your step ,touch and. [CLS] [SEP]you 're already on your way to being a really good hip hop dancer .stay tuned to next videos .
so we 're going to move to the four and the four minor chord .we 're going to use the same shape that we used for the d. [CLS] [SEP]thinking about stringed instruments and shape is very helpful keeping things straight .so that shape is what we use for our d major chord .and the root was here , ok ?so our root for our g chord is here .and we 're going to use the same shape .ok , so starting on the third , there 's your g chord. [CLS] [SEP]but then when it goes to a g minor chord , ok , and if we wanted to spread the g chord out a little bit , here 's your root of your g.you can come down here .ok , so up to this point we have , i was doing like a little dotted quarter note kind of thing .but same shape again , so we 're kind of moving our way through the song .
and i tell you to freeze it cause i make a lot of me .it 's just cheaper to make that way. [CLS] [SEP]and so what i do with my kids a lot i get them involved. [CLS] [SEP]is. [CLS] [SEP]i make pizza. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm not great at making pizza dough. [CLS] [SEP]so there 's other ways to easily substitute pizza dough and one of them is using the pita bread i just showed you how to cook in this segment your going to do basically the same way .another one is english muffin pizza 's which are fun and the kids will love them and they love to make them. [CLS] [SEP]and then you just might have a half of loaf bread laying around .that 's the third way i 'm going to show you today how to make your going to take a half of loaf french bread and show you how to make a pizza on this .also on expert village i make how to make garlic bread a real easy way is to take that garlic bread and get some fresh mozerilla and some of your tomatoes that i used for marina sauce .soon as that garlic bread comes out you add some sauce add some shredded cheese put it back in the oven 350. [CLS] [SEP]so the cheese is melted. [CLS] [SEP]you got a great pizza on your garlic bread .i 'm not going to show you today i 'm just going to tell you when i come back were going to start making some pizza your hungry i am .
once you have your initial chain compare it to the width of your calm take out the loop. [CLS] [SEP]so you have room to work with it and see if it fits around it .it needs to be pretty snug .this does n't quite fit even if it stretches and it fits then. [CLS] [SEP]that is good but this does not quite fit. [CLS] [SEP]so i am going to add a couple more loops to it .probably about four .now let 's see how it fits .yes that fits perfect .you just barely have to stretch it for it to fit .there we go now. [CLS] [SEP]we have the very top of the leg warmer .
in this clip we 're going to cover how to deal with writer 's block .now i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]sure you know that dreaded feeling of when you have things really cooking on a project , your creative juices are flowing , and then one day you go to work on it and all of a sudden. [CLS] [SEP]it 's blank , nothing .you ca n't seem to get past that , you ca n't seem to know where to start .the main thing there is to not get down on yourself and not get upset .writer 's block is completely normal .you might try the obvious which i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]sure you 've thought of is just taking a little time , getting away from that project .taking a walk , changing your routine a bit , and going back to it later .now if you notice you still ca n't get rid of that writer 's block , i think it really breaks down to. [CLS] [SEP], it could be in two possible areas that there 's a problem .one is personal things going on , and another is problems relating directly to that project .now on a personal note you may have things as silly as cleaning the garage or calling to make that dentist appointment , making some phone calls -all these little nagging things that are in the back of your mind .normally you can deal with those , but when you 've got the pressure of writing and your being creative that 's taking up all that room , these nagging little things can all of a sudden have a louder voice .sometimes if you recognize that helps it .other times it 's just like you might have to really take out that time and go clean the garage .i hate to tell you to do that. [CLS] [SEP], i hate that myself , but that might be the answer .take care of some of these nagging things and you 'll find that when you sit down you can feel like , `` hey , i can justify this time of sitting down and working on my project . [CLS] [SEP]''now the other possibility might be that your writer 's block is based on your specific project .you may be doing too much .you may be doing twenty page dissertations on each character and their backgrounds .in that case , somewhere in your back of your mind , it 's going `` this is too much , '' and you 're blowing a fuse .you need to , in that case , do the basic research you need and jump into your project , move forward .if you 're having a problem in one area , move to something else .put your time working on your project into writing , into jumping in into that creative process as soon as you can , and getting a rhythm .now my personal take on writer 's block is that when we 're creating , when we 're writing a play and dealing with all of the characters and the plot points and putting it all together and pouring fourth that creative energy , we 're using a lot of our brainpower .to me , when we 're doing daily chores and going to work and driving around , we 're plugging our brains into the wall socket .when we 're writing a play and being creative , we 're plugging our brains into the power plant down the street .usually as you 're writing , even if you 're stuck on some things like you 'll have a couple great characters , you 'll have certain plot points that are really working and areas you can move forward , if you get stuck in all of those areas , your brain just might shut down .so you need to step back and really look and maybe see what the problem is .maybe you need to add a character , maybe you need to change a plot point .see what it is that might be causing the blockage , and it could just be one character is bothering you , or one conflict is n't real enough .you can change that and things will start to flow again .of course the final option is that somewhere in the back of your mind you 're realizing that this is not the project for you , and that 's fine .you 're not expected to know exactly what you want to write , and as you 're writing it you may like the idea still , but you may not really be excited about it , which you should be .you should be passionate about your idea .if you 're not , it 's fine to put it down , file it away .maybe in six months or a year you 'll want to pick up the idea or you 'll get some other concepts for it , and that 's fine .so in combating writer 's block , remember do n't get down on yourself , and if it is more than a real temporary thing , take a look at if it 's a personal or more a problem related with the project .try to identify what that is , and solve it , and hopefully that will move you right ahead .
today we 're going to talk about planting the spring garden , and some of the tips and tricks that you can use to get off to an especially early start .now there 's a few things you can think about , and we 're going to be showing you a couple of ways , to start with a more robust spring transplant .if you start with seeds in the ground in april , well then you get off to a slower start .but if you can find a way to get propagated root cuttings , or stem cuttings , into the ground , be it with garlic , or vegetables or fruit crops , you 're going to get off to a much quicker start .today we 're going to show you some of the tips that you might like to know about in terms of getting that extra early spring start .we 're going to cover garlic , we 're going to cover rhubarb , we 're going to cover lettuce plugs , and we 're going to show you how to plant peas , not only from seed , but also from transplant , something not too many people attempt .
alright in this section i 'm going to show you how to check your brake fluid and possibly bleed if you need to , if you have really low pressure .this is your master cylinder right here .this is where all the fluid gets collected and this is pretty much your whole brakes right here , and this tube runs down , right to this and this pushes it through and that goes down to your calipers that we worked on earlier .so what you want to do is remove this screw , and then this is a screw off top .now brake fluid is really , really bad stuff , so you do n't want to get it on anything , skin , paint , anything .first thing you do when you check a master cylinder. [CLS] [SEP]is you grab this top seal , pull it out real slow , and you 're going to make sure it looks just like this .most of the time , when you have a , when you do a brake job , and they 've really gone through it , this thing will be just all over the place .most of the time you 'll see it looking like this .it 'll be turned inside out from all the pressure .so you always want to get it pushed down , make sure it looks just like it , how it , how it should , in it 's real form .right here , the brake fluid looks real good , and it 's right at the right level .so , in this case , you would n't do anything to it .but if you needed to , if you needed to get in there and bleed the brakes or anything , the first thing you 're going to do is you need a , a kit like this .this is a brake bleeding kit , comes with a filler , now this makes it , for a one person installation .all this does. [CLS] [SEP]right here is it clicks onto the top of your reservoir. [CLS] [SEP]you 're going to be taking this piece right here and putting it onto your caliper. [CLS] [SEP]there 's a little fitting and you put that on the fitting. [CLS] [SEP]and this is going to suck all of the fluid down and. [CLS] [SEP]what it 's going to do is remove all the air bubbles in the line .during that process this fluid needs to stay full , if this does not stay full you 're going to suck air bubbles into the line. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to have all kinds of problems .so when you get a kit like this you fill this with your , their proper brake fluid , in this case its going to be dot 4 , fill it up , turn the valve on and this will keep this full the whole time and all you have to do is take this and your going to go down to your caliper and. [CLS] [SEP]on every caliper there is one to two little fittings on here with rubber caps .all you do is pop the cap off , just like that , and you 're going to take this and put it on top , just like that .then you get your air fitting , plug it in and everything is ready , you '' re going to get your tool , which is normally a eight or nine millimeter and what you do is put it on top , now what you do is , when you pull this trigger its going to get real loud. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to start trying to suck all the air out of the line down from here .so i 'll turn it on and what you 're going to do is you 're going to loosen this just a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 're going to see all the air bubbles coming down the line. [CLS] [SEP]and once you start seeing all the air bubbles coming down the line , you 're just going to wait until you start to see a steady flow of fluid. [CLS] [SEP]and once it 's steady you just tighten this back up and move to the other side and your always going to start low .get all your air bubbles out low because in the end , air travels always to the top. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to end here in this fitting right here .this is the very top where air bubbles could end up and when you get an air bubble. [CLS] [SEP]this , this lever right here will go straight down , you wont have any break control whatsoever .so always just work your way from the farthest to the closest and that 's basically how you bleed the brakes .
there : hello expert village .let 's say we wanted to change the color of our text .well , we 're going to do it with what 's called the font tag .we 're going to open the font tag , and we 're going to close the font tag .notice. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm opening it and closing it just like all the other tags .hopefully , you should be getting used to this .now , we have to add an attribute of color .color equals , let 's say , red .so , we have our tag. [CLS] [SEP], we have the attribute is color .color equals red , close tag .we 're going to save the document , we 're going to reload , and what do you know ?now it 's red .say you want to make it red , but you also want to make it bigger .before , we used the tag called 'big ' .now i 'm going to add an attribute to 'font ' called 'size ' equals .now , in this case , i 'm going to make the size equal plus one .let 's reload it ; now it 's red and its one notch bigger .let 's say i made it plus ten .now it should be ten times as big as it was originally .there you go .so you can see , that with the font tag , you can control the color , the size , and there are many other attributes to the font tag where you can control all the aspects of your text .just to show you , you know we can make this green , save it , reload , and now it 's green .so there you have it .
child posture is done with many , many postures of yoga as a conclusion of that posture and its different variations .just come up on your hands and knees. [CLS] [SEP]and you take your knees out to the sides of the mat and sit back towards your heels .now you 're trying to stay close to your heels , many people ca n't do this as they go forward , but you can take your arms down , just stay close to the heels .sometimes you have to take a fist upon fist to rest your head .or , there 's a variation of taking a hand upon hand , relax the shoulders .or , take your head right down the floor , relax the shoulders .but in child 's posture you want to feel those knees going outward , you want to feel yourself keep reaching towards your heels. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to keep the shoulders relax .and in child posture , you hold there for a breath , just breath in deep to your nose .and using the breath , exhale to your nose , bring your shoulders release and down , sinking right back towards the heels .take another deep breath in .exhale and feeling the shoulders and the back release .and another deep breath in .and exhale .and one more time , deep breath in .and exhale , feeling not just the shoulders relax but the back sink right down .and then guide the flow away from you , come all way back up .
we have our half cup measuring cup here , we 're going to go ahead and dump this in , make sure you get all of it .we 're going to need one more half cup .the same thing , we 're going to measure it off and pour it right in there , put the shortening to the side .now we 're going to need two teaspoons of vanilla .at this point start on low and mix it in , and turn it up step by step .now at this point we 're going to go ahead and pour in two cups of our powdered sugar , we 're going to measure our cup , go ahead and turn it on low and pour this in. [CLS] [SEP], we 're going to go ahead and turn this up and while this is mixing we 're going to go ahead and measure one more cup and then pour this in .as we 're going to see it 's going to start to crumble , turn it up one more step .at this point we 've had our vanilla , shortening and powdered sugar mixed .we 're going to go ahead and turn this on and add two tablespoons of milk .so it 's on a lower setting. [CLS] [SEP], that 's one and that 's two , made a little bit of a mess here. [CLS] [SEP]but that 's okay .we 're going to turn this up slowly and it 'll start to mix itself together and go ahead and turn it up a little bit more .now we 're going to take our wooden spoon again and scrape this all off the sides. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to mix it for about thirty more seconds and come back for our next step .
you know , in order to win a game , you 've got to first get the ball .hi , i 'm travis , and one way of getting that ball is by boxing out .you know a lot of teams , and a lot of players do n't actually practice the fundamentals of boxing out .but , we 're going to show you just how to do that .alright , if i 'm going down low and the ball goes up for a shot , that 's when i want the rebound , so what i do to get that rebound. [CLS] [SEP]is i 'm. [CLS] [SEP], what boxing out is , is i just put myself in a position between the basket and the man , in the perfect position so that i can get the rebound as opposed to that person getting the rebound .so , what i do is i. [CLS] [SEP], if the shot goes up , i want to set my , i want to head , head hunt and find that person , find that person , find someone to box out .when the shot goes up , you look , do n't look at the ball , first you look at a person , find a person , and once you find that person , you lock them in .put your body against them , and shield them from getting the ball , so if the ball goes up , i 'm shielding them , i use these , the backs of my elbows as my eyes , you do n't want to foul. [CLS] [SEP], you do n't want to elbow , but what you do use them for is these are your eyes right here , and right here , these two points on your back .so , you use these to kind of feel and see where that person is , so when the shot goes up , and you come down. [CLS] [SEP], you 've got him , you 've got that person behind you , and you feel where they are so that you , only you can get the rebound .so , when the shot goes up , finding them , got boxed out , got the rebound , and once you get that rebound after the box out , make sure you keep it at your chest , turn around and search for someone to outlet the ball to .there you have it , boxing out .
hi , today , i 'm going to show you how to fish with a bobber .okay ,first of all , we 've got our basic bobber , and there 's all kinds of different bobbers from red and white bubbles to corks to this balcer type bobber .now , what you do ; first , first of all you want to set up your hook. [CLS] [SEP]and you put whatever bait you 're using ;worms , minnows or whatever , and then up about eight to ten inches from that hook. [CLS] [SEP]you want to place a split shot .what the split shot does is , it keeps the bait down .then you put your bobber on-on the line .this one here happens to be a spring-loaded type bobber .you pull down on the spring and there 's a little slot in the balcer where you put your line in , and then you let that spring go back up , and it holds the line in place .now what you 're going to do , after you have your rig set up and your line out there , what you 're going to do is you 're going to cast that bobber out there , and. [CLS] [SEP]then you let it float down the stream or the lake or whatever ; and when that bobber pops under the water , you 're going to set the hook. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's when you get a fish , and that 's how you bobber a fish .
next , i want to show you the bow stance punch .same principle .open , here 's your horse stance. [CLS] [SEP]first , you turn gong bu which is bow stance ,body straight , okay , both feet , your toes in , do n't open like this , toes in , hands on the waist ,when you turn , when you punch , turn your body and punch in central line , your nose central line .you punch the other side , your hands , punch forward , back , one hand forward and the other hand goes back .and make sure turn and twist .make sure your elbow do n't go out , it 's inside .okay .and one , and two , three , four , and fast , fast .and you do to the other side .and one , two , thre , four , five , six , seven , eight .
everybody likes to hit a kill shot , which is a shot that hits just inches off the front wall .but it 's not always the best strategy to go for a kill shot every single time .so you have to incorporate good strategy and hit pass shots , but when do you hit a pass shot ?often times you want to hit a pass shot when the kill shot 's not working .so the perfect shot obviously is really low , kill shots but not everybody , and even the best players in the world ca n't always hit the ball that high , or that low .so sometimes you want to bring it up and use good strategy on pass shots because that can be just as effective .so , if the kill shots not working , switch to a pass shot .you do n't have to hit the ball this high to have it be effective .a nice pass shot , knee or chest high , as long as it stays on this wall or cross court can really throw your opponent off. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's great strategy to hit just a simple pass shot .you do n't have to swing as hard , you do n't have to get as low .just stand here , bend your legs and hit a nice simple pass shot .you 'll find yourself , that working way more often than trying to hit kill shots over and over and over again .
well , there 's a similarity there .responsibility is a part of how to avoid jealousy .let me give you an example , and i 'll give you several examples .you and your girlfriend , this is for men , are sitting in a restaurant , and along comes a girl , and you see her. [CLS] [SEP]and you go .guess what ?you have now created jealousy .you could have avoided that jealousy , by not going , bad idea , and you know better , and you know that you 're not going to meet that girl .you know that you 're never going to see her again , and yet you put yourself in a position of causing your significant other to become jealous .it 's a natural reaction , that your girlfriend is going to do that , and guess what ?it happens the other way around .it 's a very simple matter of a girl smiling at a guy and saying hi , and you 're standing right there , and you are really twisted .well , she can avoid it too .ladies , do n't do it .do you think that subtle smile , that little wink , that look , is going to be ignored by your significant other ?of course not .it does n't happen , so if you want to avoid jealousy , and that 's the way it starts , and it snowballs .it gets bigger and bigger .stop doing the little things , and it wo n't lead to the big things .this is dr. [CLS] [SEP]paul .may your fantasies of today , be your realities of tomorrow .
so , in order to cut your string or wire , you 're going to need cutting utensils .with stretchy cord , you can use scissors or wire cutters .and you can get all these at the hardware store , by the way , or bead shop , anything like that .the tiger tail , do not use scissors .you will ruin your scissors .and you can use any of these type of wire cutters for tiger tail .it 's very easy to cut with wire cutters .do not use scissors .with memory wire , it 's way thicker .so you do n't want to use really delicate wire cutters , because you 'll put little nicks in them .they 're too delicate .so you want to get a more heavy-duty wire cutter , because it 's a lot thicker .
hi , i 'm amelia and i 'm going to talk to you about how to best lighten blonde hair .since blonde hair is already relatively light , you do n't have to go through a lot of different processes to do it , so. [CLS] [SEP]what i would recommend , if it 's something that you 're wanting to do at home , you can always try the old fashioned lemon juice and sitting out in the sun , that has been known to work .there 's also straight peroxide , which is n't best for your hair , but again it does work .you just take a little bit of peroxide and you would just spray it on the strands that you would want to lighten .then there 's also something called creme bleach that you can get , the kind that you women use usually to lighten facial hair , that 's also gentle enough that you can use it on your hair .now , these are not ideal , ideally would be to go into the salon and have a professional do it , but if you 're budget minded. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're just looking for a quick fix , these are some ways to do it .so , that 's peroxide , lemon juice , a little bit of creme bleach , and. [CLS] [SEP]again that 's something you 're going to want to apply maybe with a comb , and you just comb it through , wherever you want it , or even a mascara wand that you can get , just a disposable mascara wand that you can get at a beauty supply store .you just dip it in the product and just comb it on as well .and , those are a few tricks that you can use to lighten blonde hair .
soccer players all around the world are major fans of other soccer players .just like children are that play the game , and fans , and other spectators are fans as well .a lot of these teams get together for friendly matches that 's not , that turn out not to be so friendly after a few minutes .some of these games turn out to be very physical and very physically demanding .at the end of these games , sometimes you see players from each team exchanging their jerseys .this shows that they have great respect for each other .also , as being these great soccer players are also huge soccer fans , by being fans of other teams and other players around the world they allow themselves to change jerseys .also , these major clubs are very affluent and can also afford to have so many jerseys for each game .before each game , a lot of these clubs get new jerseys , and this is just a way that they show that they have respect for other teams by being able to exchange them .and that is why soccer teams exchange jerseys .
working in a quad position on all fours we are going to work with hamstring curls , hamstring leg lifts. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to add in the challenge of tubing variable resistance so depending on the thickness of your tube. [CLS] [SEP]will dictate the amount of difficulty or resistance you are going to get. [CLS] [SEP]so score yourself off with your knees hip width apart , hands right underneath the shoulders , nice neutral cervical posture .we do n't want to hyper flex or point , just sort of relax and lead with the hamstring .exhale on contraction and inhale down .so i inhale and exhale when i lift .i do n't want to lift any higher than the hip joint because after that exercise is over and you are not engaging hamstring any more , hamstring is connected to the low back. [CLS] [SEP]so the low back is going to start taking over .the goal of the exercise is to really focus in on the hamstring where the gluts and the hams meet so you can create that nice separation bicep of the leg .now the further away i pull the tubing the more of a challenge that is going to get as the tubing gets tighter .working in 10 to 15 rep range , 3 sets .
now i 'm going to tell you how to make stuffed potato tortillas .the tortillas are made of whole wheat bread and they are the staple indian diet for northern indians .we eat it with curry , we eat it with vegetables , we eat it with lentos .like everybody eats bread here , we eat the tortillas .let 's go about the ingredients for the stuffed tortilla .i have whole-wheat flour .i 'm a healthy person. [CLS] [SEP], i go to whole foods and get the whole wheat flour .bleached flour is basically not that good for you .it sticks in your stomach .i think we should all eat healthy .we have whole wheat flour .we have potatoes here , boiled potatoes .we have our bright green chopped chilies we have our ginger roots here .we have come sea salt .yes , healthy again .we have some ground cloves .we have paprika .we have asafoetida powder .this is a little bit better , so it has to be used very , very carefully .it 's very good for digestion .if you have a stomachache , you can take some asafoetida powder with water and it helps to clear your system .it 's a natural herbal remedy for stomachaches .because it 's bitter , you only want to use it in the right amount of quantity .then we have our fresh chopped coriander leaves .okay , these are all the ingredients we 're going to be needing to make our stuffed tortilla .oh yes , one more thing .we 're going to be needing clarified butter also to fry the tortilla .it has this kind of consistency and it used for frying the tortillas .if you make lento soup you add it to it .it 's supposed to be fattening .some how the moms think that the kids should be fat and healthy. [CLS] [SEP]so use a lot of that .we should just use it in the right amount and not use in excess , but it does taste good .these are all the ingredients for our stuffed tortillas .now , let 's go about making it .
what we 've got to do now , rich , is we 're standing in front of each other , we 'll look at each other , psyching each other out , and what not .and we 're coming down to the table .you 'll put your elbow down , just like that .we 're meeting at the wrists .what 's important now is that these wrists are bent .this helps give you leverage on your opponents power .you want to be able to get a jump start on his mental state which you do by , you can do all the screaming you want , but the real intimidation comes in your forearm when you can actually give him a sense of your power and you are already wrestling before the arm wrestling starts to happen .
so the variations are actually -- for the second half of the chorus , they 're pretty much the same thing .you have the hi-hat lift and the upbeat of three going into four on the snare , and then the next one is hi-hat lift on the upbeat of three , snare on four and then hi-hat lift on the upbeat of four again .okay ,so literally it 's the same thing .it just gets a little trickier because you have those hi-hat lifts in the downbeats of two and four as well .he leaves out the four downbeat lift when he 's doing these tags , okay ?so it 's not -- otherwise , it will get a little messy .this is what the first variation sounds like .okay , so he 's not doing , you know , upbeat of three lift and then downbeat of four lift as well ,okay ?it 's closed on the downbeat of four when he 's doing the snare hit. [CLS] [SEP], okay ?so he has that upbeat of three lift. [CLS] [SEP]and then the next one is the upbeat of three snare upbeat of four , okay ?okay ?so that 's the second variation , and it 's the same alternating scheme that he 's using from the four in the first half of the chorus .it 's two-bar phrases .the second bar , he 's doing the tag ; and every two bars , he 's alternating between the first variation and the second variation .so here 's the eight bars , the second half of the chorus .all right ?so that 's what 's going on in the second half of the chorus .you put the first half and the second half together , you got the whole chorus and that leads -- you can kind of feel as you 're playing it , how that kind of builds steadily into -- and gains momentum going back into the verse .
let 's talk about the infield fly .another quirky little situation in baseball that rarely happens but when it does is often very misunderstood .what the infield fly rule means is that the ball has been hit into the air within the field of play over the infield .what happens in this situation and the reason this rule is in effect is because the runners who are on base can not advance until a pop fly has been caught by the fielder .if there is a runner on first , a runner on first and second , or a runner on first and third. [CLS] [SEP], that means you are in a force out situation and the runner has to run when the ball is hit in the infield .if the ball is hit on the ground he has to run anyway .if the ball is tossed to second base before that runner makes it to second base , it 's an out ; you then throw it to first base for a double play .the infield fly rule is in effect because a fielder on the infield could theoretically allow a pop fly to hit the ground , toss it to the second baseman who would then toss it to the first baseman for an easy double play .the infield fly rule is in effect to prevent that from happening .it can only happen if there is a situation with less than two outs in the inning , there 's a runner on first base , a runner on first and second , or a runner on first and third creating a force out situation for a double play .then the ball has to be hit within the field of play over the infield .it can sometimes be left up to the umpire 's discretion if it 's hit over the lip of the grass or sometimes travels a little bit further into the outfield .that 's a basic overview of the infield fly rule and why it 's in effect .
ok.so now that i explained the different parts , muscles , nerves .why the foot and all the different things about the foot .i want to focus on reflexology ok.and reflexology is more traditional and like asia. [CLS] [SEP]you know middle east different things like that .so that 's , it 's western style modality .we use it here in the united states as well , as part of massage treatment .but the main focus is not really muscles. [CLS] [SEP]it 's not muscle displacement , it 's organs .it ?s meridians .it 's points in , within your body that are attributed to points in your foot .so what i 'm going to go over next. [CLS] [SEP]is kind of like how you break down the foot and into the different organs in the body .and how the foot is , is a diagram of the body .
i 'm going to show you how to choose a camcorder .okay , the first thing you have to ask yourself is `` what do i want to use it for ? ''is it for home movies ?or , is it for independent films ?is it for movies on the internet , or am i getting real serious production happening here ?that can ... [CLS] [SEP]that really does steer your decision making process .two is dollars .that greatly steers your decision making process !camcorders usually go from the ultra-cheap in the three hundred dollar range , uh , from three hundred dollars to eight hundred dollars , twelve hundred dollars , three thousand , six thousand , eight thousand .and then we 're talking about real cash , all right ?and how you 're going to use it. [CLS] [SEP]really 's going to dictate what you want to use it for .your small , palm held camcorders , they make some in hd now that are ... [CLS] [SEP]that you will see used for ... [CLS] [SEP]for shows on discovery and other network quality shows , for small things .those are going to be more .these cameras here in the twelve hundred dollar range , they offer a lot of features , but the difference between a camera like this and a camera like this , other than the size , well , is the lenses .you 're going to see ... [CLS] [SEP]if we pop the lens cap open on both of these here ... [CLS] [SEP]you 're going to see a difference in the lenses .the glass makes the camera .it 's an old photography term , all right ?the bigger the lenses , the more ...the more professional a lens is , the better the ground , the better the optics. [CLS] [SEP], that 's where your money 's going .also in the 'pick up ' chips .whether you 're going to have a ccd or charge coupling device , or a c-moss processors , these are now coming to become popular .you want , at very least , a three chip camera for any kind of professional use at all , or for your richest picture quality .three chip is going to have an individual pick up chip , or ccd , for r , red , b , blue , and g , green .rgb , those are the three colors that make up our video signal .with a chip dedicated to each of them , you 're going to have a nice , crisp picture .now , the types of cameras are going to be the new ones that are going to be pure digital , meaning that it 's going to go to a hard drive or stable card inside of it , or it 's going to go to a tape .usually in this case a mini dv .now , if it 's truly just for home movies , then you can consider a dvd burning one .that 's where you put a mini dvd into the camera. [CLS] [SEP]and you take it out .if you 're planning on editing , or any post-production , um ! ...it ....it 's not my recommendation at all .you want to go to either a stable media flash drive inside of it , or you want to go to a mini dv where you can archive it .look at the reviews , kick the tires , play with 'em , consider it , even do some more research .i hope this helps ya !i 'm christopher rokosz .happy shooting !
remember to use boiling water , not room temperature cause the noodles would get different texture .then we would use a pair of scissors to cut the noodles. [CLS] [SEP]then they would be easier to handle .to chop the garlic cloves we would smash them. [CLS] [SEP]and then we would chop them one way .then we would change the direction to finely minced them again .then we would put the garlic cloves inside with the other chopped vegetables .
now no matter if you 've chosen to shoot in a studio or at your house or on location somewhere .it ; s almost always best to have the owner present .they can have a lot more control over the animal .they know its tendencies and they just know little tricks and things that they can do .and , it can help you get a better picture .the owner will also know what treats the animal likes , how many they want them to have and those kind of things .like , for example , these are just simple little treats but if thingsare n't going so well. [CLS] [SEP], i know with my dog and probably with most dogs that a little piece of cheese or a hot dog might actually be the best thing to keep the animal 's attention .also , it can be great to have the owner help you direct the animal .so , while you 've got the animal set up on your back drop and you can be behind the camera , your owner can have a squeeky toy or a treat that will help get their attention so that you can focusall of your energy on just catching the right moment .lastly , mika 's a pretty good sized dog. [CLS] [SEP], she 's about 60 pounds and a dog. [CLS] [SEP]this largecould do a lot of damage to your studio , knock over lights or damage equipment or even the back drop .so , another important reason to have the owner present is so that they can help control the animal and make sure that they are nice and relaxed so that you can get great pictures .
so what you want to do is try to ollie it first and if your doing good on the ollie go ahead and kickflilp it ,so remember use those 5 steps that you learned. [CLS] [SEP]earlier just put them all together get a little bit of speed and kickflip over the gap .and once you got this down you go ahead start trying. [CLS] [SEP]some stair set. [CLS] [SEP]you know go. [CLS] [SEP]find a 3 stair something just practice that , step it up some more try a 5 stairs 6 stairs just keep going .
this is anthony and we 're going to talk about how to go about making a photography portfolio .the first thing you want to do to make a photography portfolio is you want to edit down your best , and i mean your best , 20 to 30 photographs .and those photographs , now they want to have a dialog with each other .you do n't want to just throw in a couple of pictures of houses , a couple of pictures of people , a couple of pictures of my dog .that 's like one of the worse things you can do .you want to have a cohesive amount of work that shows your style .key .second thing to making a portfolio is. [CLS] [SEP], how am i going to put together all of these pictures ?you do n't want to bring your pictures to potential job , employer , client in a paper bag , i mean , or in a shoe box .you want to present yourself .and , i mean this .i have seen people with the best presentation in the world and not such great images , but they still got the job .and i 've seen people with the best photographs in the world and have the worst presentation and they did n't get the job .so , you really want to think about both .if you have awesome photographs , photographs you 've worked hard on , that you 've edited and you put them together with an awesome portfolio , you are going to be set .this is my portfolio .i have a handmade leather portfolio .some people refer to this book as a dinosaur in a way .most people nowadays have a website or a blog ; i have all that .but i also like the physicalness of my portfolio .it 's a great way to impress a client .this is a rather old one .this one has really been around , i 've had it for about 15 years .but , in a way , the leather , it looks like , you know , it gets better as it gets older .it has a nice banana leaf insert and i can change my photographs in and out. [CLS] [SEP]as i 'm working with this book .and it just shows everything in an easy way for people to get a feel of what my work looks like .that 's really the main thing you want with a portfolio .now , i could carry around my images on a disk and a lot of times , i do .when i sit down with a client , i bring my laptop , put it in. [CLS] [SEP]and they look at it .and you know what ?eighty percent of the time , that works perfect .but , i like to bring both .i have a disk. [CLS] [SEP]and i have the physicality of this actual hard copy of my image .i just find as a photographer , this works the best .and , if i want to make something for somebody , if i 'm printing another portfolio for another artist or another , if i 'm doing a wedding or if i 'm shooting an event and i can put together a story and put it in a book like this , my job is really done well .the other way that i can put a portfolio together is in an archival box .they sell them online , an archival box , 11 by 14 , 8 by 10 , probably cost you about twenty to fifty dollars .and that 's essentially how i go about making a portfolio .
now we 're going to be doing effleurage strokes on the neck .place an anchor hand on one side of the head .get your oil , and then apply from the shoulders , up the neck .we 're going to be doing a wave like motion under the neck on either side of the spine .working the upper traps and into the occipital ridge .then we 're going to hook into the ridge with my fingers .fingers are bent like this , but my wrists are relaxed .and , you can apply a little bit of traction when you lean back .effleurage down and up the side of the neck .you can get the the levator scap .when you go under the neck , put the pressure of the back of your hand on the table and glide down to the shoulder , lightly upwards into the essien muscles which connect from the clavicle up the mastoid process .these are soft palmed , down the shoulder and up the neck. [CLS] [SEP]and i would be doing this on both sides of the neck. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's effleurage on the neck .
the next step in our living room project is to paint the trim .we are going to use the semi-gloss for that , which is exactly what it says , it gives a real nice shine to it .as oppose to the wall , which is a flat .now , we have a full can of pain there , and we want to avoid drips as much as possible , so. [CLS] [SEP]i recommend emptying out a fair amount of the paint , so you have about a third left in the can .and you can just set that aside for when you need it .now , i am going to do this by hand without relying on any help , as far as drawing a line , but if you do n't feel confident you can use painter 's tape .you can get this at any hardware store , and what you want to do is cover the areas that you are concerned getting the trim paint on .now , this is going to be black on black , but we are just going to pretend that it 's more contrasting color , if you want to put some on the floor , and that way , you 'll avoid getting any black paint on your wood floor .again , to avoid drips , you want to give your brush a little shake like that to get off any excess stuff , you do n't want a lot of paint on your brush when you do this .so we are just going to start off on the edge .you want to let the brush do the work for you , do n't push it too hard .if it 's a good brush , it will just do what it should do .if you do by chance get a drip , it 's a good thing about latex paint , it will come right off , especially on a wood floor .keep in mind that this is only that first coat , we are going to be another one on .so , like the walls , if you do n't get everything the first time around , you 'll get it. [CLS] [SEP]the second .the trim is a little different because you are working very precisely and slowly , as oppose to the walls and the ceiling , and you really want to make sure you spend the extra money and get yourself a good brush , makes all the difference in the world .
in this clip we 're going to talk about the proper service procedure to replace your engine 's timing belt and water pump .in this step we 're going to talk about the proper procedure for reinstalling our front engine motor mount .this is our front engine motor mount and it drops in from the top and actually sits on the inside of the fender well right about here .now it has two bolt holes in it .one there and one there and. [CLS] [SEP]these bolts go up through the body here through some holes .alright. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to go ahead and drop my motor mount down in. [CLS] [SEP]and this is the hole that comes up through the bottom right there. [CLS] [SEP]and there 's another one way back here in the back .i 'm going to go ahead and sit it in position .it 's not crucial to line up the engine yet , all we 're focused on is getting it lined up with body , you can see here. [CLS] [SEP]i can see straight through and what i 'm going to do. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to reach down and slide it up through the body .alright. [CLS] [SEP]and there we go .once you have the motor mount mounted to the body , you can go ahead and start the bolts for your motor mount to the engine bracket connection .you can go ahead and manipulate your engine any way what you need to or you may need to jack it up a little bit or move it side to side to get these bolt holes to line up from the mount to the bracket .most of the time if you 've got the mount installed correctly , they 'll just about be lined up perfectly .we got three bolts to deal with here .they 're all identical , as you can see , there are no oddballs .we 're just going to go ahead and drop them in , one ... [CLS] [SEP]two..three .alright. [CLS] [SEP]once you have all three of them started you can go ahead and tighten them down .now just like anything else , just like anything else , i like to start with the center bolt first and then move out from there .so , we 're going to tighten this one down , this one. [CLS] [SEP]and then this one .now as you can see there 's marks from where the bolts used to be .we 're just going to snug it up then relax our tension on the engine and let those marks line back up and then tighten them back down .alright now what i 'm doing is just manipulating the engine a little bit just to get a fuzz more adjustment out of my mark .you can see there how i can pump it up , the marks go farther out .that indicates i need to let it down some. [CLS] [SEP]so my marks line up a little better .oops , a little far there .and right there .as you can see all the old washer marks line up and that 's what we 're looking for .go ahead and tighten them down now .of course , start with the center bolt and then work out from there .alright , that is the proper service procedure for installing your motor mount and attaching the motor mount to the engine itself .
i 'm going to show you how to do reverse undulation walking backwards in belly dance .so start with our feet facing straight ahead , knees bent , belly button pulled in , chest lifted , shoulder blades back and down , arms out and away from the body .good .so now remember a reverse undulation will sit , tuck , pull , lift .as we sit and do our level change down , we 're going to step back and roll up , step back and roll up .step back and roll up .step back and roll up .so it 's step , tuck , pull , lift .step , tuck , pull , lift .step , tuck , pull , lift .good .a little faster now , good , smooth it out .step , tuck , pull , lift .step , tuck , pull , lift .good .if you can do n't change your level as you travel , keep it nice and smooth and isolated .step , step , step , good .make sure you 're stepping right on that beat .and step , step , step , step .good .so now you learn how to take your reverse undulation and walk backwards .good job !
when you have your band the next step is to decide the type of music you 're going to play .a lot of the times the music is dependent on the style of the group of people and also their personal tastes and interests .physical style can be related to musical style as well .for example , in blind all records , a group that i 'm a part of the music focus is on hip-hop .you can tell by the imagery that it is more urban style and it has an outline of the musical styles that they 're going to be in .another friend focuses on jazz and blues .you can see by her imagery it is more jazzy and less urban .another group that i have worked with is called nutshell .they have more of an alternative rock sound .this is also shown by the imagery and their style of clothing .
so right now i 've just completed this redo , this cover up ,this eleven year old piece .and as you can see there 's no trauma to the skin .you know , it 's not bleeding , it 's not puffy , it 's not red .you know , that 's the right way to approach it. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to show you the before shot , which is here .and you can see on how the outline is a single pass outline with holidays in it .and you can see how the red has definite holidays in it , and there 's no three-d effect to it .so in order to rework this existing tattoo and to make it something she could be proud of , as opposed of laser removal or a complete cover up , these are one of the options that you could come up with .and you could do too .so i 'm going to hold this up here next to it , or underneath it here .and you can see the difference on what it is .the initial in the middle is `` year of the dragon '' .it 's a japanese symbol. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's an image that fit in there nicely that covered up part of the rainbow .and you can also see the light gray shading in the spaces here that give it a lift off type effect .and that 's about it , finished .
okay folks , in this clip we 're going to talk about how to create storyboards .now , for the purpose of this video. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to assume that you are artistically talented in some way , because if you 're not , you really should n't be trying to tackle the whole storyboard thing , unless you 're purely trying to get your framing issues down , where , in that case , you can just draw little stick figures within the boxes ,and , you know , know exactly , you know , roughly what size. [CLS] [SEP]you want the individuals to be in the frame .storyboarding is roughly about translating what the director wants to see into the early conceptual designs , before anything 's ever been shot .it 's a ...a lot of times , it 's followed , you know , very much to ... [CLS] [SEP].by. [CLS] [SEP]frame by frame by frame when it actually comes to shooting .some directors stick to their storyboards like the bible .others toss 'em out as soon as they arrive on the set .to create good storyboards , basically what you need to understand first of all is the way a sequence is going to piece together .you 're going to want to start largely with your establishing shot , the first thing that the audience is going to see in the frame , whether it be a close up of an individual or a sweeping landscape , just to establish wherever you are .then you 're going to want to immediately follow up with a second shot of the frame , which is essentially when the action starts .when , you know , the guy who 's in close up takes a swing at the next guy .or we , you know , focus in on one individual working on something in the frame .basically it 's the ... [CLS] [SEP].we 've already established the shot .we move into the very next shot .now from here , you can pretty much , you know , do anything as it ...it really depends on the scene .if it 's an action scene , you 're going to basically wan. [CLS] [SEP]na ... [CLS] [SEP]lay out each individual action beat , and kind of show what the camera 's going to see each and every frame .if it 's just a scene where you have two people having a conversation , you do n't necessarily need to go into great detail about when the close ups are going to be , and when the wide shots or medium shots are going to be .you 've already sort of established that .storyboards , at the end of the day , are to show when the , sort of , the specialty shots come in .the ones where the director 's like `` man , i have this idea for this shot , and i want to get it down now so that i do n't forget it later .and i want to be able to use this as a reference later on. [CLS] [SEP]when i 'm actually there on the set . [CLS] [SEP]''so , being a storyboard artist is all about laying down those shots that you 're going to want to get later on .and to do that , you have to understand how to frame things , you have to understand how sequences piece together .and once you 've learned how to do those things and understand those things , you are definitely well on your way to becoming a very good storyboard artist .
rope stretches for the upper body ?jonesy is going to take a rope here , and he 's going to do some stretches for the upper body .basically we have three variations that we 're going to work through .jonesy is going to go ahead and start the first one , shoulder dislocates .basically all he 's doing is working up and over , using the rope as a good stabilizer for where his hands are , and just working a range of motion of his shoulders forward and backwards , up and over his shoulders .now jonesy 's going to go ahead and give a variation here .okay .he finds a sweet spot .he 's basically finding a spot in his chest and his shoulder , and through his biceps that feels a good stretch , something that you know that it just feels good .once he gets that , then he rotates his trunk around .the rotation of the trunk is actually going to help loosen up his shoulders and his chest .then we 'll go through the third variation here which will be a wrap around the body .he 's taking one arm up and over , wrapping around his body and bringing it back down , and then he 'll bring it forward , back again .do one side , and then the other side .good .those are our rope stretches for the upper body .
now in this last clip , i 've been waiting for this .what we 're going to do is experiment using all of the , all those movements .whether we 're coming up from the five to the one .or coming up from the four to the one .or reversing them , coming down .here 's what we can do it .ok ?here 's what it 'll sound like when you put them all together .remember that variation there .keep coming up .so what i 'm going to do with my foot now. [CLS] [SEP]is try some of those .
in this clip we are going to begin the rough exterior shape of the bowl .what we are going to aim for is a nice slope like that , a nice gradual curve .this is what we do n't want is something like this and the reason is when it comes time to hog out the inside , this area right here is going to be real hard to turn because it is at a very acute angle .so let 's get started on that nice gentle slope .
in this example what i 'm going to show you how to do a hybrid picking. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to be doing the key of b minor .and i 'm simply going to play a b minor chord over a drum track .and pretty much what hybrid picking is is holding a pick like you normally would and then using anywhere from your middle index and pinkie or all of them to execute the rest of your playing .and with the drum tracks for this example sound like this .you know what i did there was a very basic kind of a bouncy percussive type hybrid picking on that .and what i did was simply just played the root note of b with the pick and then used my second , third and fourth fingers to go .and what i also did too was. [CLS] [SEP]kind of i muted the notes right after i picked them to give it that nice percussive feel .so what i was doing there was simply playing b. [CLS] [SEP]and then the g , b , e parts with my fingers .and that again is another interesting example of how you can do a simple chord , say like b minor add a little hybrid picking and create a nice percussive type strum .
let 's talk about treating a dog with a cold .cold is a very non specific term .and humans , we think of colds as being anything from the flu to just upper respiratory viruses alone , and in essentially it 's the same with a dog .if you 're dealing with a cold , what we have in a dog is going to be generally an upper respiratory infection , a lower respiratory infection , something like that .just feeling kind of bad .a lot of these in dogs are viral and/or bacterial .and so the first thing to do is to identify if your dog is sick. [CLS] [SEP]and we 've talked about looking at your dog as far as lethargy is concerned , not eating very well , sneezing , coughing ,anything like that would indicate that your pet needs to go to your veterinary office. [CLS] [SEP]so they can diagnose your pet with a cold .as far as treating a pet with a cold , we commonly use antihistamines , we commonly use antibiotics since a lot of these things can become infections .and generally the other thing on pets , especially dogs , is supportive care because a lot of animals when they have a cold or any kind of illness are not feeling very well .they 're going to be off of their food or water .so good supportive care at home is the best thing you can do .
alright .now , that we 've got the round neckline down , we 're going to do a u-shaped neckline just curving a little bit lower than the round neckline .and , this is what it will look like at it 's beginning point .and , it 's pretty much the same as the round neckline .except , like i said lower .you want to make the neckline low .and , then again here. [CLS] [SEP]and here you want it to look like it 's coming around the shoulder like it has some depth and three dimensional quality about it .it 's not just a flat paper doll .there we go .and , you can have it. [CLS] [SEP]this is in moderate scoop .you can have it dip , low cut evening style .and , that would still be a scoop neck .or , you can make it go out wider .there 's really any number of things , just up to your imagination .
now , as i look at this. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm noticing that i 'm missing the gap between here and the edge of our vase .and , there 's some of the wall showing through underneath this trapezoid shape that represents our greenery .so , i 'm going to go ahead and use my yellow to bring in some of those colors .this is the top of our vase .so , i 'll use my yellow to bring that in .and , the reason i 'm using yellow is i want to create some contrast. [CLS] [SEP]so that when i put the greenery in here .if i use a green back here there wo n't be enough contrast .so , i 'm going to use the lighter color yellow as a way of bringing some of that shape in .and , then i 'm going to refine the edge of this with the same yellow and the edge of that pot or the vase with the same yellow until it comes down and hits the back of our kitty cat .and , i 'm going to do the same thing over here and try and start to reform and reshape the edge of our pot in the foreground .and , then we have a leaf that 's in the way .and , now we 're starting to see these objects start to separate and have some form and shape creating the outside shape .and , let 's go ahead and add that in there .because , that 's also a clear area that i can see quite clearly .
ok , the next category of herbs were going to talk about are the astringents .lemon is one of the most astringent things in the world , and witch hazel .do you remember ,i remember when i was young watching the older women put make up on. [CLS] [SEP]and they would put witch hazel on their face before they would put the makeup on .what that does , its because witch hazel is an astringent and it tightens and tones .astringents tighten and tone .you might say why do i want something tight ?well when it was flabby , like what if you have varicose veins or what if you have hemmorrhoids .you would like to tighten that up .thats what these herbs do .they tighten and tone .they give muscle strength .white oak bark and butchers broom for example are both used for varicose veins and hemmorrhoids and any kinds of bloodclots anything like that because they tighten and they tone .what they also do is they dry , they are very drying .so what we , we have a little demonstration here .i have a combination of herbs that i have put together allready .its an astringent combination .there is some dandelion in there , theres some purslaine and some other things .my lovely assistant whos still actually here. [CLS] [SEP]surprisingly .were gon na show you how drying this can actually be .have a little drink there .now this is mostly water hes drinking , but were gon na show you how this can really dry you out .give it just a second and the whole inside of his mouth is going to lose all moisture .thats why i have this paper towel here , i 'm going to show you how dry he is in there .ready ?see absolutely nothing , theres no moisture in his mouth at all .so when would you want something drying , when you have something thats too wet .if you think about your ailment , your imbalance , whatevers going on with you ; if its a wet thing look to something drying .if you have something that needs to be tightened and toned , look to the astringents .
hello i 'm stevie moore and welcome to my studio here at the artist 's attic in lexington , kentucky .alright. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to add some more shadows. [CLS] [SEP]and as you can see i kind of have this violet tone going on down here .i am going to start with mixing some shadowy colors , dark grays and blues .i am going to play around with these colors and mix them around .i am kind of making rocky shapes with this .remember my light is coming from this way. [CLS] [SEP]so my shadows are going to be on the right side .shadows on the right side and in keeping my shadows on the right side and working in with the rocks .now you can do this quite a bit at this stage even though the patient is dry but it would harder to add highlight but adding shadows is not too difficult .i am going to add some purpley blues and red and get a lavender , get some cool colors in here .i am trying to preserve some of these areas with warmer colors .i want to keep them alive because they add interest to my rocks .even though i have got a good color i need to move this up to mid-ground because there were to large stones and now put some shadows up there .just spread the intensity out .i do n't want a layer of too much paint because too much darkness and depth just yet , that would be something we would do later on in the segment kind of adding in .you can do this quite a bit more and expand upon this .i am going to move on down into the river .i am adding some stones and this is a bit of a torrid this is some active water .i am moving down to my white and add some color .i am going to add in a little bit of shadows and then go overkill with white .i am going to go back to my medium sized bristle brush. [CLS] [SEP]and i am going to start loading up on the white and then start making this into rapids .see how i am doing that ?do this throughout the rapids just pound that into the shadow .the texture is what is going to give this to us .the river of no return .these colorado rivers move very swiftly .when i photographed this it was dumping so this already gives you a good amount of detail here in the foreground .you can always light it up a little bit later all the way to its edge .a nice swirling rapid river .
the tool menus are basically two little boxes that tell you what kind of functions you can do at that moment .if you look at the top of the arrange window right here , you 're going to see these two little boxes .the pointer and there 's a slicer .now to switch between the two within that box , i just have to hold on the apple key .once i hold on. [CLS] [SEP]the apple key. [CLS] [SEP]it 's going to change from the first to secondary .you can change the first and secondary tools by clicking on the little down arrow .by opening up you can go to the pencil , pointer , eraser. [CLS] [SEP], there 's a bunch of things .and once you set it up per window .so it may be like this setting on this one , but when i go down to the audio editor , the sample editor , it 's going to be a completely different set of tools which i can change .and these are really important .these let you grab tools or move tools , zoom in , and draw in different , you got like different ways of drawing in things and all types of other things .these two tools are probably going to be what you use for the whole thing .
so after our bridge pose , we 've warmed up our back a little bit .we 've done locust , we 've done a little cover , we 've done a little bridge .we 're going to work into some more extreme back bending .back bending is an amazing miraculous thing for sending the energy that stagnates in our core , through our limbs , through our body , waking us up through the heart and energizing .so this one is bow , we 're going to lay down on the belly. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to reach back for the ankles .when you 've got the ankles , you ?re going to flex the feet , all you 're going to do here is reach the toes toward the wall behind you , letting the shoulder blades be drug together , keep the toes flexed and do n't let the knees come way apart .just see if you can keep them in line , inhaling and exhaling , release and do one more time when you 're ready , inhaling , lift the heart , opening opening opening .take three to five breaths here , and then when you 're ready , release .and you can rest for a moment in savasana on your belly before we move on .
we 're going to now discuss how to hit a fairway wood off this downhill , side hill lie .so , the ball is below my feet .now this 3 wood is a long club .so , normally i would be about like this if i was on level ground .so the ball 's another 6 or 8 inches lower. [CLS] [SEP]so i have to learn to compensate for that .so i have to sit here .so i ca n't really lean forward .if i lean forward it would be a very weak swing .so this is why it 's very important to get some strength in you mid-section and your legs .because a lot of shots you 've got to sit and if you do n't have enough strength you ca n't hold the balance .but , you want to be in a good position here. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm sitting a little bit which lowers the club down to the ground and now the ball 's going to go on a fade or a slice pattern because the balls below my feet .so that 's the natural action of the ball .so you 're going to have to aim to the left on this .so i 'm going to compensate. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to aim to the left of my target to compensate for that .and , because i have plenty of club , normally on this type of shot if i was on a level lie i might want to use a 3 iron or a 4 iron .but , because i 'm on this side hill lie i want to use a 3 wood because i 'm going to lose some distance due to this .so , i sit down. [CLS] [SEP], i get lined up , and i just take a nice , easy swing .ok , so that one was struck perfectly .i was able to account the way i wanted to for this lie. [CLS] [SEP]and i was able to fade the ball right at my target .so , if you practice this shot a lot you 'll really see the results. [CLS] [SEP]and you wo n't fear these lies .you 'll say , `` ok , bring it on , '' and you 'll be able to attack the ball with confidence .
in this segment i 'm going to talk about the names of the notes .there 's a - the names of the notes are basically an alphabet , and they only go from a to g. [CLS] [SEP], it 's easier than going from a to z.the alphabet goes a , b , c , d , e , f , g , then it starts again over in a. [CLS] [SEP]now our best friend , the most important note to know in all of the piano is middle c.that 's the center of the universe for the piano .now , as you can see there are black keys , and there are white keys .and the black keys are grouped into groups of three , two , three , two , three , two , three , two , it goes on and on like that .if you find a group of black , two black keys , and you go to the left , that is c.and that 's just how you find where c is .so if i was going to find another c. [CLS] [SEP]i 'd find a group of two black keys and play a c. [CLS] [SEP]another two black keys , find a c. [CLS] [SEP]and to find middle c , our center of gravity for the piano. [CLS] [SEP], you 'd find where the words are , you know , this is a samick. [CLS] [SEP], there 's yamaha , roland , there 's all types of brands of pianos .and i would find the c closest to the words , so this is my middle c. [CLS] [SEP]and we talked about , this is going up ,so i go c , d , e , f , g , a , b , c , d ,e. [CLS] [SEP]and. [CLS] [SEP]if this is c. [CLS] [SEP]i go down , b , a. [CLS] [SEP], g , f , e , d , c .
combine the two to pull off this pretty advance trick .start by rolling backwards , pop the ollie as you normally would , bring your front foot to level out and roll away .the major difference between doing a regular front ollie and a fakie ollie is that doing the fakie ollie you have to push your front foot further up and faster to get the momentum of the board in order to level it out and roll away .let 's see one in action .roll backwards pop and land .usually when performing this trick , i like to keep my focal point on the street as i 'm rolling backwards on the nose as i 'm ollieing and back to the street as i land .let 's see it one more time .roll a fakie , pop the ollie , bend the knees and land .with enough speed , learning how to fakie ollie can lead you into learning how to do more advanced fakie flip tricks .
so now we have our design and we are going to cut a piece of glass that will fill it in. [CLS] [SEP]so we have our panel .so i am going to just mark it and take our glass cutter dip it in the cutting oil. [CLS] [SEP]and we need to score it which means we just cut it very lightly until we here the membrane , the top membrane on the glass is making a rupture. [CLS] [SEP]or it 's cutting it .here we go .and i think that did it .now we need to tap both sides .hmm nothing happened .well in that case we will do it again .so now i am going to score it again .that 's better .okay that fits right in .we will play with this later .now we will do another section .we will try to make it with as few pieces as possible so lets do that .the cutting oil probably lasted .and yet another cut there .
and i 'm going to tell you what to do if your computer freezes up and you need to shut it off .first thing you can do is , if your computer freezes up , try hitting control , alt , delete .it 's kind of like a , you know , the best way to. [CLS] [SEP], it 's like an override sequence you can use .once you hit control , alt , delete , sometimes that alone will just unfreeze the computer .but what it 'll do is it 'll bring up a window on your computer that brings up the task manager .and when that comes up , sometimes the program you 're running has caused your computer to freeze up .so , it 'll show you what programs are running and you can just highlight one and say , end task , and it 'll kill the program that 's running .and that might unfreeze your computer and allow you to shut it down normally .but , if you 've tried that and control , alt , delete did nothing , then the next step to do would be to actually go over and hit the power button on the computer .now if you hit the power button on the computer and still nothing happens , that means the computer 's really locked up and there 's not much you can do from that point on other than to disconnect the power .a lot of computers on the back will have a , sort of like a breaker where you see the power cord beat plugged into the back of the computer .basically you 'll reach back there and flip the button .there should be an on and off switch .flip that , it 's like flipping a breaker in your house .it 'll shut off the computer .granted , it 's not the best way to do it .it 's not good to shut your computer off like that , but again if it 's frozen there 's really not much you can do. [CLS] [SEP]if after you 've tried the control , alt , delete method .if your computer does not have a switch on the back , sometimes manufacture computers like a dell or an hp may not have that switch .then the only thing to do would be to unplug the power cord .most of the times you can unplug the cord from the back of the computer .so just unplug. [CLS] [SEP]that and the computer should obviously shut off because there 's no power .and then plug it back in. [CLS] [SEP]and then you can leave it shut off , but the best thing to do is to restart it from there .and then just to make sure every thing 's o.k. [CLS] [SEP], and then shut it down the way it 's supposed to be shut down from there .and if you , you know , plug it back in and turn it on , and it 's still frozen up then there 's probably a good chance that there 's some kind of virus or some corruption with your operating system , possibly even your logic board or your hard drive is messed up .so , then you would need to take it to a computer professional to take a look at it from there .but that should fix it in most situations .
in this section i 'm going to talk about dorian mode .the c major scale is actually another word for it is ionian mode. [CLS] [SEP]and there 's all different kinds of scales besides the major and the minor scale .there 's all these things called modes which basically means different kinds of scales , this scale is called dorian mode .the easiest way to think about the dorian mode is to go from d to d all white keys .and you can hear how mysterious that sounds , it 's , it does n't sound as final as a major scale ,i , but we kind of love that and love to play with that in music right ?so if i played like just some d 's in the left hand , then i might go to the four of the d scale .so i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]just improvising is this mode .
this next movement is another fairly dynamic motion and movement .we 're going to be focusing on the hips and the pelvic region as well as the quads , the hamstrings and the glutes , so more lower-chain motion and movement .we 're going to go on to a four-point position here .we call this a quad-ped motion .we talked about this earlier , a four-point position , four points of contact .what we 're going to do is we 're going to step up and across the body .we 're looking for a lot of rotation in the hip .again , many people have a lot of restrictions through the hip and the pelvis .this maybe a difficult motion which you may want to start with just coming forward and coming back .we call that kind of a mountain-climber motion .but i like to make it a little more dynamic , bring that foot up to the opposite hand , come back and then switch .try to keep the hands flat on the ground .what you 'll find is one side might move better than the other , but work on getting this power up and as much range of motion or as much movement as you can .this is good for the shoulders , core , hips , pelvis , quads , hamstrings , another great total-body movement .
okay now that we 've basically got the features of the face .we indicated the ears. [CLS] [SEP]but we did n't do anything with them .and the best way to do ears is , it 's almost like the nose .less is more .but you have to look at the individual ear .but the lobe of the ear kind of comes up and this part just comes all the way down and actually goes into the ear .so i 'll just draw this line here. [CLS] [SEP]and then this , when you 're over to this part of the earlobe it kind of just disappears .but then there 's some shadows inside of the ear and that gives it some depth .and then you have where the earlobe enters the actual ear canal. [CLS] [SEP]it kind of curves into there .i 'll just indicate that and usually there 's an earring or something there. [CLS] [SEP]and then on the same one here i 'm going to do basically the same thing .but the ears are usually different .so i 'm just going to go in there and pull out the shadow .going to indicate the ear canal there .and then sometimes this comes down to where you can see that it curves .and the same thing on this one .and then depending on where the light is , if the light source is one side or the other you can shade this ear .and so those are some ideas and techniques on drawing the ears on coquille board .
what i want to talk to you now about is how to adjust the date and time on your computer system .let me start out by saying that windows xp is a registered trademark of microsoft. [CLS] [SEP]and i am in no way affiliated with microsoft .to adjust the date and time on your computer system is very simple .it 's important to , especially because i 've had times when , when i 've had the wrong time on my computer system because i chose the wrong time zone or something , and i 'm always going off that clock. [CLS] [SEP]and i end up being late to an appointment or something .the best way to change the time is to scroll down the the right hand corner .if you look down on the right hand corner of your desktop , it gives you the time , and if you mouse over that , like i 've done , it 'll show you the current , it 'll show you the current date .if you click on this , if you double click on this , it will open up your date and time properties .let 's go ahead and bring this down to the center of the screen .this is showing exactly what time it is where i 'm located in utah , the date , and this is how you change it .for example , here 's a drop down menu for the months , you can change to what , what your current month is , if this happens to be off , this just happens to be the month of august .here 's your drop down list for the years , you can change the year and here , you would just click on the date on the calender of what date it is , to get that current .there 's three tabs up here , `` date and time '' , `` time zone '' and `` internet time '' .go ahead and click on the time zone tab , this gives you the chance to choose your time zone , right now we 're in the mountain time zone , and i 've already clicked the button down here , `` automatically adjust clock for daylight saving changes '' , that way you do n't have to keep up with that .i think that 's why my clock was always an hour off .because i never checked that .the third tab up here is your internet time , this is going to synchronize your clock with certain websites .like here 's a website , time.windows.com. [CLS] [SEP], if you click the `` update now '' button it will automatically update your date and time for you , so that you do n't have to do it manually .that 's just a quick short cut to do it , but usually i know the date and time anyway .so that 's pretty much the simplest way to do that. [CLS] [SEP], that 's important because it , with all of , with your computer , your , your automatic , your savings , and your , you know , your automatic savings and your files are all saved by date and time , and if this is not accurate , then it 's going to hard to to do system restores , or to restore certain deleted files , if your date and times are off .
more so you do not need as much foundation .i would recommend a souffle style , a lighter foundation , stay away from the thick cream foundations , because that will kind of weigh your skin down .so in a mature skin i would do a souffle or a liquid or water base , that will be really pretty .on a younger skin , if you are very oily make sure that your foundation is oil free .you can always ask your makeup artist what they would recommend as well .if you are very dry , you do not want an oil free , because that is going to suck whatever oil you have left out of your skin .so make sure you are looking at a foundation that is nourishing , that has moisturizers in it ; and most foundations will say on the bottle , it is say for oily skin or for a dry skin , for mature skin , acne prone skin .all you have to do is read a little bit , and if you have any questions you can always ask your makeup artist or the department store makeup artist , or you can e-mail me. [CLS] [SEP]and i will let you know .
first , you want to do really big waves .you want to brace yourself on your feet .your back is in the neutral , you have a neutral spine .you 're grounded on the ground and use your arms in front of you .do not pull the rope .so it looks like this .if you noticed , i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]using my whole body to do this .okay ?and what you would want to do is do this big .it 's really hard to do this for a sustained period of time .i 'm doing both ropes .do n't pull it like this .it does n't work .keep your arms in front of you .you 're getting your lats .you 're getting your shoulders .you 're getting cardiovascular work , your legs .and then , you can do them really small and nice and tight .
so when women go through puberty , menopause , perimenopause , and pregnancy , their estrogen and progesterone change a lot .that dramatically influence their brain activity , their metabolism , their mood .so acupuncture help to restore the hormone balance during those special period of time , so women can think and work more efficiently .this especially true for women aged between forty to fifty , because that 's the perimenopause period of time , and the hormone fluctuate so much within a day .acupuncture helps to restore this balance so that they can have better mood to control their work efficiency , and anxiety .
i want to show you an improv demonstration. [CLS] [SEP]i call `` yes or '' .this is a demonstration in the bad stuff , because really what we want to do in general is we want to `` yes and . [CLS] [SEP]''we want to listen to each other ’ s ideas and support them , but it 's useful to demonstrate what happens when we do n't do that when we do something else like for example `` yes or . [CLS] [SEP]''so , what shannon and i are going to do. [CLS] [SEP]is we are going to have a little conversation where we 're planning something ; maybe we 're planning my birthday party .every line we say is going to start , except for the first one is going to start with `` yes or . [CLS] [SEP]''so , i am going to say let 's plan my birthday party and shannon 's going to say yes or blah , blah , blah , blah. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'm going to say yes or blah , blah , blah , blah back and forth until the scene kind of comes to an end .so , here we go .`` let 's plan my birthday party . [CLS] [SEP]''`` yes or we could go get your car washed . [CLS] [SEP]''`` yes or we could go shopping for my birthday presents. [CLS] [SEP]”. [CLS] [SEP]yes or we could go see a movie this afternoon . [CLS] [SEP]''`` yes or we could go out to eat '' .`` yes or we could go take that big paddle boat on the river . [CLS] [SEP]''`` yes or we could sky dive . [CLS] [SEP]''`` yes or we could go spelunking . [CLS] [SEP]''`` yes or we could eat bats . [CLS] [SEP]''“ yes or we could drive a bus . [CLS] [SEP]''alright good excellent. [CLS] [SEP], so that 's a little bit of `` yes or . [CLS] [SEP]''you can see really quickly what happens to the conversation .first of all what happened to my birthday party ?it probably looks like it is n't going to happen .so , what we do is we leave ; i keep leaving ideas behind .you go. [CLS] [SEP]oh we can do this or that or the other or the other. [CLS] [SEP]and we do n't actually move in any specific direction .i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]sure a lot of you guys have had conversations like that. [CLS] [SEP]i find a lot of conversations about where to go eat dinner sound a lot like that , a lot of business meetings where you 're brainstorming or having ideas sound like that .it can be pretty unproductive because you do n't seem to be getting anywhere with your conversation .so , instead of `` yes or `` what we want to do is we want to do ``yes and , ” but this demonstration gets you an idea for what happens when you have these `` yes , or '' conversations .so , this is a little `` yes , or '' demonstration .
let 's dive right in to the eighth line , first measure .ok.starts off with that e four four .new bow .fourth finger .ok , that 's the first measure , now , look at my hand , ok.just to scale going down at first .right next to each other half steps .ok , let 's take it at a faster tempo .see ?all you really got to do is really keep practicing it , ok.so it sounds smoother .
try interpreter , when you ’ re playing interpreter , a couple of pointers on that .just pay attention , listen visually as well as verbally , use the language .the person that doesn ’ t speak english needs to not understand any of the english that ’ s spoken in the game , and feel free to use a few devices .you could give a long answer for a short answer , you could give a short answer for a long answer , but only go to devices if you ’ re not inspired and you ’ ll find some inspiration as you shop around using some of those devices .but it ’ s a great game ; you can field questions from the audience .did we have a , a question from the producer down there ?yes , there .did the curtains match the drapes ?very good , do the curtains match the drapes ?let me see if i can find out for you .( gibberish in the form of a question .very emphatic gibberish answer )no. [CLS] [SEP]they don ’ t and that ’ s my fault .alright , les mcgehee from expert village with andy crouch , the funny , funny , improviser from the hideout in austin , texas .( little bit more gibberish at the end ) .i guess it ’ s true .
okay , we 've covered a lot of ground so far .this one is serving into the body .so imagine your opponent is right here waiting for my serve , and he thinks i 'm going to serve short or high or deep or wide in this area , and i just drill one right into his body .okay , now if i catch him napping just a little bit , i can get him with a very weak response .it 'll be like this or like that .i may not win the point out right , but i 'll get a very , very weak response .so once you 've established the ability to hit all these spots , then you can , then just take one right , right into his body because i normally would n't want to serve right down the middle of the service box like that .but if you , if you 've already set him up with a variety of serves , and you have a nice , smooth motion that he does n't really get a feel what you 're going to do , then you just , you just crack it right into the body .and you 'll see that in tennis a lot too .so when you serve into somebody 's body , they have a hard time getting out of their own way .like if the ball was over here , it might be easier sometimes .if you get into the body , a lot of times it 's very tough .and you also can serve down the middle .okay , i do n't always recommend that serve because that might give them a forehand. [CLS] [SEP]and they can maybe attack it , but if you do it , if you set it up right , you catch them off guard. [CLS] [SEP]and you just serve it down the middle .so , so those are some things you can do to change the pace and the tempo of the game because a lot of , a lot of this game of squash is rhythm .so if you get , if you get somebody out of their rhythm , that 's when you have a chance of picking up an easy point .
i 'm from san francisco , california .i 'm a sponsored skateboarder , and. [CLS] [SEP]i run a skateboarding program for youth , called the sf skate club .i 'm here to explain how to do a nollie kickflip on a skateboard .now , what you 're going to want to do , is have a knowledge of how to do a regular straight nollies on a board.you 're going to want to feel nice and comfortable , cracking your nose , nollieing off the ground , and landing .once you 've got those mastered , you 're ready to learn how to do the straight nollie flip .now , what you do is , you want to put your toe on the tip of the nose , but do n't drag it over the edge , because when you put your toe in a focused position on the tip of the nose , you can get as much pop out of it , as you can , so with your back foot , you 're going to put it just behind the back set of bolts .point it outward just a bit , and then once you hit the nollie on the ground , you 're going to drag your toe up the length of the tail , and then off from the tail , letting the board flip in the air , and then landing back on , and rolling away forward .now , with any flip trick , it 's going to take a lot of patience , to learn how to do , and a lot of experimentation with different foot placements , to figure out what is going to work best for you , but the best way to do it , is to make sure that your foot is pointed just slightly outward , front foot pointed just slightly forward , and pop it as high as you can , and this is how you do a nollie kickflip , on a skateboard .my name is shawn connolly .i 'm from san francisco , california .i 'm sponsored , and i also run a skateboard program , called sf skate club .you can find out more about it at , sfskateclub.com .
this jacket i created to be a jacket. [CLS] [SEP]like you would imagine i dream of jeannie era like a 50 's housewife whose throwing a party , this is her jacket .she 's got a dress on underneath or maybe this is just the dress .but there 's the overall sense of propriety with the belled flared skirt .there 's the cinched waist creating elegance .there 's the off the shoulder folded down type lapel shoulder line and overall. [CLS] [SEP]i do think it does call to mind modern mid century modern type. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's where architecture plays in with all of my designs .i had a thought of mid century modern. [CLS] [SEP]so i took my diagonal design lines from mid century modern architecture from modern design and added those in. [CLS] [SEP]so it creates two different dimensions with which i 'm using the concepts of mid century modernism to convey my jacket that is belted and belled and lady like and proper .
ok , moving on with home on the range .we 've gotten to a part where we 're going to be repeating .this next phrase is just like the beginning of the song .so we should have landed so that we 're ready to proceed with an up bow on d.so you recognize that phrase from our lesson a little while ago .g , a , b.then we 're going to be doing our g to. [CLS] [SEP]f-sharp again , going right down to e.so g , f-sharp ,e.that whole phrase .g-sharp , f , e and c.so essentially the same thing that you played the beginning of the song with some change to it , but keeping in mind that we have n't gone away from this pattern or notes yet .so starting on that up bow d , d , g , a , b , g-sharp. [CLS] [SEP]i. [CLS] [SEP]'m sorry , g , f-sharp , e , then c.one more phrase. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll have the whole song ready to go .
okay , preferred equipment .you 're going to need cleats .depending they make different kind of cleats .these are firm ground cleats .they also make soft grounds and low spike cleats .these are pretty good for this kind of grass .i mean because the grass is n't too high .it 's not too low .so you always want to buy your cleats a little bit big .because if you buy them too small then when you put on these thick socks they 're going to fit you really tight. [CLS] [SEP]and sometimes they 'll be tight right here .i always buy adidas cleats because they 're pretty comfortable .and as far as socks. [CLS] [SEP]i also buy my adidas socks .you always need to wear long socks in case you are going to slide tackle somebody you have to wear long socks that way you do n't get all scraped up .shin guards .shin guards , it 's always good to get light weight ones .these are my nike shin guards .they 're pretty cheap .they 're like $ 5 bucks at academy or any sporting goods store .sometimes you need to wear this because as competition comes you do n't want to get cleated .shorts .also soccer shorts .these are my uniform shorts for my team .i play in a sunday league .my shirt also .lightweight .that way the sweat will go through it .they dry out pretty quick .and last but not least you need to have a soccer ball .so any kind of ball is pretty good. [CLS] [SEP]just make sure it has enough air .not too big not too small .regulation size is 5.as you can see , for competition .
the next exercise we 're going to do , sometimes called bridge pose , sometimes called table pose .you 're going to bring your hands behind your back , fingers pointing towards your feet .the knees are bent and you 're going to lift your hips up until they 're level with your knees and shoulders .breathe deeply , if you ca n't stay here with a calm and smooth breath just come back down , when you 're ready come back up .the way to stay here is to use your feet intelligently , press the front of your feet down , tighten the thighs but relax the buttocks .if you 're comfortable here , you could drop your head back .but if there 's pain in your neck just keep your chin into your throat and move the stomach as you breathe .so as you inhale , watch your navel , push the belly up and when you exhale , bring the stomach back down .stay up here for a few more breaths if you can again , if you ca n't stay up , just come down .lean forward take pressure off your wrists and then come back up into the position whenever you can .take a couple more breaths and when you 're done with this just sit back down , stretch your legs out and lie back down on the mat .
when it comes to side kick , look at my feet .i have to swing my body sideways , sideways .but i am kicking with the front leg .sideways , you see that ?sideways , sideways , sideways .now from here , from there , from here .now , from here side kick .from there , from there , from here .the steps , the movements are very small .take a look from here .i am shifting forward and backward .now , the other side same thing .if the kick is right there , take a look. [CLS] [SEP]my body balance is one hundred percent right here and send a kick to the side .so we conclude with the subject of side kick over the rocking feet .
this step is the third basic throw with two balls in one hand .so , so far we have the outside circle .we have after that the inside circle .and now we learn the columns .the column is about the two balls in one hand and they do not change their position .i just throw straight throws each time .so the ball outside stays always outside and the ball inside stays always inside position .they never change places .something very important about playing with two balls in one hand is that our shoulder is relaxed and our upper arm is relaxed as well .however , we use the biceps. [CLS] [SEP]but we use the lower arm. [CLS] [SEP]and we use our fingers .the columns with left hand .so we do exactly the same what we did with the right hand , with the left hand .we throw columns so the outside ball stays always outside and the inside ball stays always inside .something very important is still about the position ; that our body does not turn like that to control the ball .it 's enough. [CLS] [SEP]my eyes or its enough if i turn my head .but also , just imaging. [CLS] [SEP]i have a third ball in this hand .i have to control that as well .so the best is with my eyes i can control the whole space what i have around me .and also the other thing , as i said i use my lower arm. [CLS] [SEP]so i do n't lift my upper arm like that. [CLS] [SEP]and i do n't turn my head like that because then , all this part gets stressed and i can not really juggle in a relaxed way .so my shoulders are relaxed , my upper arm is relaxed and my elbow is fixed. [CLS] [SEP]and i just do the throws .and the other thing , that i have to arrive to the point when i can throw each throw at the same level .so one throw is not higher than the other but they both are always at the same level .
on behalf of expert village , my name is anthony lucas of bujinkan tohoku dojo of new york city . [CLS] [SEP]today i am going to show beginning techniques of ninjutsu . [CLS] [SEP]the fourth technique
so making sure the abs are engaged .the key is to keep the abs engaged and at the same time inhale and exhale .ideally , you want to be able to inhale and exhale through the nose .this is something that will definitely come with practice .so to start if you feel you need to inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth that 's perfectly fine .you want to make sure your breaths are long .inhale is long and the exhale is deep and long as well .if at any time you find you 're holding your breath or you lose your breath that means you need to ease up possibly modify or come out of the posture .bring your breath back to a steady pace and then go back into the stretch .each time you exhale is when you 'll find you go deeper into your stretch .this is very important .the easiest way and the quickest way to progress in your stretching is to keep a really strong deep exhale .each time you exhale you should feel the body release just a little bit .so as far as the posture goes you want to make sure. [CLS] [SEP]again your abs are pulled in and your shoulders are down .at some point i may ask you to round through the spine .if so , i want you to think about pulling in through your center first .the deeper you pull in through the center the more. [CLS] [SEP]you 'll see your spine round right , rather than hunching through the shoulders or just rounding through the spine you 'll consciously pull your abs in which causes the spine to round .also , i might mention hinging or keeping a flat back .if i ask you to keep a flat back. [CLS] [SEP]you 'll keep your shoulders down and have a strong straight spine .again , this comes from keeping the abs pulled in .you 're going to think of hinging from the waist. [CLS] [SEP]so you 're always going to want to think about pulling up and over with a strong straight spine. [CLS] [SEP]ok.so again , keeping the breath deep , keeping the abs pulled in , shoulders relaxed .if you lose any of the posture , if you do n't feel your posture is 100 % , again you want to ease up or modify so that you are in a perfect place of posture and breath .this way you 'll see the posture , you 'll progress a lot quicker through the posture .ok , so again keeping everything intact and in line is most important .
next , we 're going to stretch our sides , if you have an armrest you can place one arm on the armrest .if you do n't , you can just place it at your side or let your arm hang at the side .so doing the right arm first , we inhale reaching the arm up and then exhale , leaning over to the side .you want to reach the fingertips up to the ceiling and exhale lengthening , deepening the stretch over to the side .making sure , you keep both hips on your seat the entire time .inhale extending reaching up exhale dropping over farther into the stretch .deep breath up , exhale over into the stretch and with your next breath bringing through center and we 'll do the same thing on the other side .again , you can let the arm drop to the side or place it on your armrest .left arm coming up with the inhale and exhale taking it over , keeping both hips on the floor .deep breath in as you reach up and exhale lengthening over to the side .again inhale up and exhaling over , one more breath in , exhale over and then bringing it back to center and feeling how wonderful the effects of that stretch are .
the first batten should be installed with the top corner flushed with the fascia .the second batten is the most important and is installed by chalking a straight line 15 inches from the first batten .as the roof slope increases this dimension should be reduced accordingly .this will allow the front lip of the panel to overhang the fascia .when the eave is crocked , adjust the line down slightly to average this discrepancy while still providing etiquette overhang .when the eave is not parallel or square with the roof , adjust the first course slightly to compensate .if required , additional adjustment can be made in the second course .if the top course is not parallel , adjust or telescope the last course of tile slightly to compensate .extra care should be taken when you have a short tile course as it will display variations .when the roof plan is cut up , you may have to lay out part of the fill from the bottom up as normal and transfer the balance from the top down .in this case it is important to work uniformly down , each side of the roof projections maintaining eave in coursing .the remaining battens are installed at 15 and 13/16 of an inch or 402 millimeters on center .this spacing is crucial to obtain proper panel fit .the most accurate method is to use the batten spacer which will lock into a fasten batten and hold spacing while the next batten is butted to the spacer and fastened .
the common consumer sparkler , or the consumer type of firework , can add a lot of fun and excitement , to most holiday party events .what we 're going to talk about , is proper extinguishment of the sparkler .sparklers come in usually two varieties .this type is made onto a bamboo , or wooden type of stick .the other type , is some type of wire type , of stick .sparklers can burn anywhere from eleven hundred to eighteen hundred degrees .that 's very hot .once the sparkler burns down to the end of it 's life cycle .take the sparkler and bury that hot end , by sticking it into some dry sand , or a close bucket of water that is nearby , for the purpose of extinguishment .it may also be helpful to keep a fire extinguisher handy , just in case , if some type of uneventful fire , happens to take place accidentally .remember the wire , and even the bamboo sticks , can remain hot for an extended period of time , after the sparkler 's life cycle is over , and it burns out .stick it in dry sand , or have a bucket of water handy and close by , for people to drop that wire or bamboo stick into , after extinguishment occurs .i 'm captain joe bruni .stay safe , and we 'll see you next time .
here 's the back side body pass as it passes me just swing my arm. [CLS] [SEP]grab it puts me in position to throw the cross body .this combination is much easier with the right spin on the disc there a cross body stacker going to a pass catch .now we can also do near side pass which is more difficult our arms swing down on the same side. [CLS] [SEP]and we catch it just as it 's passing our hip .you can also do a reverse forehand pass , as the disc is passing we setup for the reverse forehand by grabbing it with our thumb on the bottom and the fingers on the top .and were setup for a reverse forehand throw .
so , starting with the same c d e f g , and then going down half steps .i 'm going to stop there as well. [CLS] [SEP], you were hearing those last few notes , a much deeper sound. [CLS] [SEP]and they usually will be able to resound from the chest area .now , if you 're a male voice you might feel you still have a lot of capability of going down .so , feel free to continue going the same pattern , just going down half steps .and continuing on until you 're comfortable .never exceed the range that you feel comfortable in and never push yourself or strain your throat .singing is much like any other type of exercise .you 're not going to risk , a marathon runner is not going to risk actually straining a muscle but preferably will warm up little by little until they can get to the farthest point .same thing for singing .you want to make sure your throat , vocal cords are warmed up , singing little by little , with these types of exercises , and as your vocal cords warm up and you get used to the range getting wider , go ahead and start expanding out , but do n't expand out if you 're not feeling that your technique is relaxed and appropriate .
in this series , we 're going to talk about some things women can do to keep themselves safe while traveling or when their out and abroad .one of the key areas where attacks often occur is in parking lots .in this case we have an outdoor parking lot .one of the things that you can do to make yourself a little safer is always park underneath a light if it 's going to be dark when you leave .you also want to make sure that as you come in , you check your car , you would look underneath it , look in the back seat , those kind of things .underground parking lots pose a different kind of a problem because there always have limited lighting and that 's a very common scene for attacks .they 're often very deserted and since they 're under ground the public at large does n't have clear view .in addition to the parking under a light one of the things you can do to protect yourself is try to find a closed circuit tv camera that will have your vehicle in frame .they 're usually posted on the building walls , sometimes from the light posts themselves .and that will help to make sure that if something happens that it 's recorded or more importantly that the criminal will see the camera and avoid attacking anybody that 's in the field of view .it 's also important to remember that the camera , it may not be real and it may not be monitored which means it may be running a feed to a recording device. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's probably. [CLS] [SEP]is nobody actually watching at the time .so if you 're attacked and you 're on camera , there 's no guarantee you 're going to have someone come out and rescue you .
usually just one tablespoon of brown sugar and 3 tablespoon of conditioner is enough for a normal size head but you could always make more double your receipt if you like .what the brown sugar does it helps to exfoliate the scalp .so it could help with getting rid of dandruff .you are going to want to rub the scalp in circular motions .the person would really enjoy this .it is very relaxing for the person who you give the scalp rub to .then you rinse it well or you could shampoo it out if you choose .the next homemade hair receipt is probably even easier then the first one .it is one teaspoon of honey for four cups of warm water .you just pour it on after you shampoo and leave it on .do not rinse it out and dry your hair as normal .this puts a very nice natural shin on your hair it is not sticky. [CLS] [SEP]and it smells so good .it does n't get much simpler then that so try some of these homemade hair receipts at home and see how you like them .
if your budget range is sort of low , there is one creative gift that i would enjoy personally to give to my boyfriend and it would be a poster .you can get posters anywhere online ; you can probably go to any store and find posters .one site that has posters is actually viewposters.com .you can just get a huge range of different posters and it would be just a great cheap gift idea that would mean a lot .different stores that you can find posters at would be at wal-mart , target , hastings , barnes and noble and it would definitely be a gift under $ 10 .then if you want to get even more creative , you can get autographed posters .if you want to go all out and find autographed posters , then you can go to ebay and you can find anybody on there .
i 'm a professional artist and. [CLS] [SEP]we are talking a little bit about the giclee process today .now we are going touch on the end result. [CLS] [SEP]once you 've had your piece photographed .if your photographer shooting film he has given you a transparency .your next is this needs to be turned into a digital file .so , either a photographer can do it .there 's places .i have sent mine out to companies .i have done some research and what they will do is they will scan this transparency and they will send you back a disk .your digital file will be on this and this is what your giclee is created from .so , obviously if your photographer is shooting digital , not a big deal .if you are having the image scanned , not a big deal .you 've already got a digital file .but , if you do use a photographer make sure that you do n't forget that step because you ’ re not going to be able. [CLS] [SEP]do much with this as far as printing .so , find yourself , get some recommendations from your photographer if they do n't do it themself .but , definitely find someone that understands the process of scanning this into a high quality , high resolution digital file , so you will have a quality giclee reproduction when you ’ re done .
hi , my name is scott. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]the owner of climb on indoor rock climbing gym in wilmington , north carolina .today we 're going to discuss the safety of rock climbing .some of the safety procedures would include ; checking your partner , making sure their harness is on right , making their , their figure eight knot is correct , make sure that the belay are setup correctly .some of the other safety aspects would be knowing your environment what 's around you .are there other people climbing ?is there somebody above you ?if you 're climbing outside , you want to make sure that you 're wearing a helmet so that if some , a piece of rock falls from the top , it does n't hit your head .some of the other safety aspects would be making sure that you use your climbing commands ; to make sure that your belay is ready for you to begin climbing .these are all things that you can learn at your local indoor rock climbing gym or by a qualified rock climbing guide .we do stress that you try to learn these , these safety procedures before you go out climbing .being in an indoor climbing gym is a great place to do that because it 's controlled environment where you can learn many , many aspects of rock climbing including all the safety procedures that we just discussed .thank you and this has been safety procedures for rock climbing .
so we tried this record at actually a slower speed and we found it was even farther than it was originally .so we do n't need to make it slower we need to make it faster .so let 's just try another one , instead of negative one. [CLS] [SEP]let 's move it to positive one .so i 'm looking. [CLS] [SEP]i 've got it set at a positive one. [CLS] [SEP], we 're going to play the record .find our beat got our beat , counting three , four. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to throw it in .is it right ?still to slow , going to try it at plus two find my beat two , three , four , three , two , three , four , four , two , three , four .is it right ?we 're getting closer , it 's really close. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's not right .
so we 're going to use two units of this , two units of this , and three units of this one .i 'm going to start with this one .we 're going to take a four patch , a square , pin them together , right sides together , and since these are such short seams i just usually use two pins .and that 's together , and i 'm going to take another four patch , and a triangle finishes this one off .we need two of this unit , so we 're going to take a floral square , a four patch and a triangle .on the triangles , i like to make sure it 's the right order. [CLS] [SEP]and then it flip back because it 's easy to get those triangles turned the wrong direction and have to pick it out and redo it .and then we 're up to this unit .triangle , four patch , on the triangles make sure you line the top up , the bottoms going to look a little off but when we sew through those tips it 's going to be just perfect .solid square , four patch , and a triangle and one last unit like this one here .okay , our units are all pinned together and ready to take to the sewing machine to sew together .
we 've already cut our strips on bias two and a half inches wide and now. [CLS] [SEP], we 're going to be joining these bias seams in preparation for putting our binding on our quilt .the first thing we have to do is make sure that we have like image .in other words , this image and the slant is identical to this image .now , if we set this up and we had a situation like this , we would just take one of our strips and flip it around and then we would have an identical image .then , right sides go together and then we 're going to pick up the top piece , and we 're going to angle it so that we can prepare our seam .now , what we 're looking for is stitching from valley to valley , this is what i call this is v , valley right here. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to stitch from this point to this point , so let 's do this .i will begin my stitching right where that valley is .and i 've got a stripe here. [CLS] [SEP]so this stripe is actually aiding me in giving me a line .now , i 'm going to pick up the bottom one. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to bring it up on the bed of the sewing machine .i 'm going to pick up my next piece of bias .i 'm going to make like image , put right sides together , and then i 'm going to angle the top one so that i get valley to valley and a bias line that i can stitch , and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm just going to feed the next one in .and you would keep doing this until you had enough inches to go all the way your quilt plus about 10.now , i stitched all my strips together and that is enough inches to go all the way around my quilt plus. [CLS] [SEP]about 10 inches because i need to make my final seam .and i 'm going to stitch to the very end .pick up one of my little strips , put it underneath my needle , and i can cut free my work .and that 's how you stitch together your strips in preparation for doing your binding on your quilt .
i 'm a massage therapist in wilmington , north carolina .and , i 'm here to talk about what is hydrotherapy treatment ?hydrotherapy treatment can be incorporated into many different modalities of massage and body work therapy .and basically , it is the use of water in some form , for therapeutic reasons .for example , if you use heated water , it helps to increase circulation to the muscles , and help increase flexibility , and things like that .if you use water , in it 's ice form , it helps to decrease circulation to an area , which is greatly used in the treatment of inflammation .so , water being used in those `` twof '' , two different forms , is typically , used the term hydrotherapy .there 's also hydrotherapy. [CLS] [SEP]used a lot in physical therapy , in the forms of whirlpools and saunas , and , just heated water , and things like that .hydrotherapy can even be used as a term for using hot stone therapy .if you use the hot , the , you soak the stones in the warm water , that 's heating the stones , and using the water as your medium .and that would be the use of hydrotherapy treatment .
hi , in this session , we 're going to talk to you about some acupressure treatments for arthritis in the ankles .most common reasons for arthritis to develop in the ankles is from an injury .that type of thing , being hit by a car , situations like that .what you should do first is speak with your veterinarian , make sure the dog 's had a thorough examine , and that everything has been done possible for them , but then using acupressure techniques , you can do a lot to ease pain , loosen up the stiff joints , and make that joint work much better if you do these particular procedures , and work with your dog at least once or twice a week .ideally every three or four days .and you 'll see some great improvement in how the animal is able to use those joints .so , we 'll show you some tricks and tips on how to do particular work for the ankle specifically and some general points to help use the hips and the rest of the leg when the animal is compensating for the injury from the arthritis .
let 's add a three quarter shimmy to our sharp arabic move .so let 's first do it in place till we have all the parts going in the right direction .let 's have one foot slightly in front , knees are going to be bent , pulled that belly button in .and we 're going to start with the weight , the leg in the front that 's taking the weight .so we 're going to first do like , one , two , up , up and down , down and up , up .down down in the front , up up in the back .down down , up up .takatak takatak .good .now the back foot is going to propel us forward , so when we take weight in the back , it 's going to free up our foot in the front so that we can travel .so let 's try that .so , travel up .now let 's speed it up .tak takatak , takatak , takatak , takatak , takatak .other way .tak takatak , takatak .make sure you keep your chest nice and lifted. [CLS] [SEP]so. [CLS] [SEP]that all that all the movement is in your hip .you keep the feet nice and small steps so that you do n't get out from under you , keep your weight under you .and keep breathing .check that belly button .practice this in the mirror and make sure your hips are moving evenly .
so the first double stop we are going to look at is b and f so to get up to the b in second , to get the f you need to put down your third finger first. [CLS] [SEP]and you continue it with the b and f in first .so that is the first double stop we are going to look at and as you will see in arpeggios and the different pieces that you will be playing down the line with using double stops you are going to be using the fingers as an anchor most of the time .
o.k. [CLS] [SEP], so today we 're going to make two mugs that are the same .the first step in this process is weighing the clay .and this is important because obviously if we want to make mugs that are the same we have to make sure that we have the same amount of clay to throw with .so the first step is obviously weighing the clay and what we have here is a balance beam .there 's many different kinds of weighing technology out there .obviously you can get a digital kind which is fairly old school .i know having thrown a number of mugs , for these particular mugs , i 'm thinking that we should use about three hundred and ninety grams .so i 'm going to set my scale there .and i 'm going to take my clay , pull back a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to take what 's called a wire tool which is how we cut our clay up .and i 'm going to go ahead and just take a whole slice off like this .take this over , lay it on my board .i 'm going to approximate what i 'm looking for. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm just going to see if i 'm right .too much , cut a little bit off of there .and by doing this you 'll eventually find , and again it does n't need to be completely exactly perfect because this is ceramics .but obviously you can see i 've got about three hundred and ninety grams .and so now we 've got our first bowl or mug .now mugs do n't require and awful lot of clay .however , you know , obviously if we 're making them for tea and stuff like that you want them to be a little thick because you want the insulation quality .and now we can find our second one .see this thing is a little bit more accurate than it needs to be. [CLS] [SEP]but that gets to be my second piece .so now we have two pieces of clay that are the same weight and this is the first step of this process .and next we will be moving on to the wedging .
well , fruityloops comes with plenty of its own effects and they are actually really good and you can do pretty much do whatever you want with them .sometimes third party developers make their own effects through the vst format .i do n't really know what vst stands for. [CLS] [SEP]but you can call them vst like. [CLS] [SEP]that 's the name .we 're going to perform an internet search real quick to show you just how easy it is to find these third party vst 's .i 'll actually show you one that i found that did some really interesting stuff .so i 'm going to the search bar and enter right in , free vsts .right there , the first thing you 're going to find is kvr. [CLS] [SEP], it ’ s a pretty well known audio website .you can do some searches in here to find some software and plugins and you 'll find plenty of free stuff .actually one of the things i found through here was this plugin called glitch .i 'll just put one in here and show you what it does .this one has all these effects that we showed you and actually sequenced the effects in each individual beat .right now they 're on random. [CLS] [SEP]so it 'll play a random one of these , one of these effects ; they 're all very different effects in through all these sequences .i 'm going to open up the a man and put it in that channel. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to play it to see what it sounds like .pretty wacky , is n't it ?
okay let 's combine what we 've learned in this series and use all these techniques so that we can individualize and play to the music , the train beat .and what i did here is i combined both the bio. [CLS] [SEP], i combined adding accents other than the up beat .and i also combined four on the floor .
if i 'm going into this corner. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm hitting a shot .if i hit a shot. [CLS] [SEP]and i think i 've got my opponent out of position i will turn inward .ok.so i 'm pushing along. [CLS] [SEP]i reached over with my left hand and turned back .ok.that 's ok , but what if i hit a shot that 's a wimpy shot .so , i hit a shot , it 's a bad shot .i do n't want to turn in , because that corner is exposed .so , if i 'm strung out here. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's hard to explain all of this without doing it , but if i 'm here. [CLS] [SEP]and i hit a shot. [CLS] [SEP]and i think i 'm out of position. [CLS] [SEP]i might hit a lob shot and turn this way so that i 'm giving myself some time to get back deep .so , it just depends , but the bottom line is i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]using my arms , my shoulders , my mind , my eyes , and my anticipation .i 'm using all of that to decide whether i 'm turning this way or to decide whether i 'm turning this way or whether i 'm coming into the net .it really is just an anticipation thing based on the shot i make and the opponent i 'm playing .
playing games with children has to be one of the first things that you 're going to do while babysitting .babysitting games can entail anything from coloring to playing with their toys , and even going outside .the most important thing to remember is that the games that you play are going to depend on the age level of the children that you watch .infants and toddlers are going to enjoy games that involve motor skills .for many of them , they 're finally having an understanding of their own physical motor skills .many times , playing with toys that they have in their room will help them aid in this development .pick out toys that you can see in their room that are what you would call educational ; things that they can grasp , things that they can pick up , things that they can not only pick up , but also put into other toys .this motor skill is one of the first things that children need to start learning .if you feel uncomfortable playing with their toys , or you do n't see any immediate toys that would aid in their motor skill development , simply by picking up a marker or a crayon and getting them a blank sheet of paper will also work on their motor skills .for many of them this activity is not only fun , but gives them ' a sense of independency .for older children ; their games are going to be a lot different than the developmental stage .many of them are finally having an understandinment of fantasy , so they enjoy playtime , they enjoy make believe , and they enjoy mimicking adults .go through their room and look for toys that will aid in this type of development .many of them have dress up clothes .dress up can be a wonderful time ; not only for boys but also for girls .having them pretend to be somebody that they know , whether it 's a doctor or a fireman gives em ' that sense of understanding of what people do in real life .older children may also enjoy playing on the computer .many times , mom and dad have allowed them to do so. [CLS] [SEP], so make sure before you allow them to be on the computer you get permission to do so before .once on the computer , watch the child when he plays the games .make sure that they 're appropriate for his age level , and if he needs assistance you 're always there for help .finally , with older children ; many of them enjoy going outside , as well as infants and toddlers .make sure to ask mom and dad before you begin this activity , that you have their permission .make sure they have the appropriate space , whether it 's in the back yard or the front yard .make sure before ever taking them to the front yard that you have permission , and that it 's a safe location .make sure when you take em ' to the back yard that it 's also a safe location as well .once in the back yard , many children just enjoy being outside .walk with them , run with them .if there 's certain games that you would like to play ; for instance , red light-green light or even tag , encourage the child to play with you .so remember , be dependable , be safe , and always be on time .
in this example of harmonized chords , i 'm going to branch out a little bit where i 'm actually skipping a string .for example , what i 'm going to be doing here , and i 'm going to be playing in the key of e minor , is going , starting with my root note e , and then going , pinching on the d and the b strings together .in this case it would be b and g. [CLS] [SEP]and then using my third and fourth finger for positioning purposes , too .again on the d and the b strings , this time c , and a.then moving up to d and b , the octave on the twelfth fret .and then moving back to the c and the b notes. [CLS] [SEP]and then the b and the a notes .so , what i 'm going to be doing here is going .creating again a simple melody , but again , something that can fill up space very nicely .so we 'll be going .and i 'm also using a little slide technique there as well , going .not pinching those notes , but pinching the notes that come back .so up to speed , it 'll sound like this .so another variation of a harmonized chord , this time in e minor , and using a slide technique and again creating a nice little melody .
but you do n't do any of that wrapping around the pinky or these two fingers .loose it over the palm and hold the yarn with your thumb and forefinger and wrap and keeping a handle on the yarn with your thumb and forefinger , make your knit stitch and continue on again .wrap and over .you 're not really throwing anything although i guess the name came from just throwing this like so .like many things in knitting , the logic is sometimes a bit flawed .so wrap under and over and you 're not really holding on so much here for tension. [CLS] [SEP], the tension comes from the thumb and the forefinger against the needle .
okay , so now that we have this piping made , i have maybe about two , three yards of it .i 'm going to show you a couple of installation tricks , for whatever project you might want to use it on .the first one i 'm going to do is just a straight seam , and no curves , just straight .so this might be something that you could put maybe at the bottom of a curtain or. [CLS] [SEP], let 's see , at the bottom of a dress , or something like that .so if you can imagine that this would be your curtain , and you want the piping at the bottom , and you want -- you want it to look like this at the bottom , and it 's going to be. [CLS] [SEP]-- it 'll look really pretty just sitting at the bottom .so , okay , let 's do that .i 'm going to turn it back this way .the piping goes at the bottom , and it 's so easy to do , especially with your piping foot .this is basically just something to hide the seams , so if you can imagine it 's going -- the piping 's going to be sandwiched in between here , which is going to look really , really nice .so i 'm just going to go in , act like i 'm sewing. [CLS] [SEP]the piping again but. [CLS] [SEP]in between two pieces of fabric , like i 'm sandwiching it .so we backstitch -- always backstitch your projects .i 'm just going to make sure that it 's straight and even , and since it 's piping , if you want to look , it 's stretchy --do n't pull it unless you 're going around a curve .if you 're going straight , you just let it lay the way it wants to lay .you just follow along with it .you go right to the edge and really avoid trying to -- pulling it like this , because then you 'll just have a big wrinkly mess .there we go .i 'm just going to take this out and see what it looks like .i 'm going to go ahead and cut this off .push this aside .and that 's what it looks like .there we go. [CLS] [SEP], that just looks really , really nice .and then , if you wanted to , you could do a little top-stitching right here on top and that would look really nice .let me just pop this in .that 's just to make it stay where you want it to stay .okay , and top-stitching it like this is good for a lot of things , like dresses , and like home decor , but not so much for round -- round things like pillows and stuff like that .so i 'm going to cut that off , and cut this off .and if this were your curtain , you would just go ahead and press it open just like this , and that would be the bottom of your curtains .it 's very easy to install piping on a straightaway .
when you get newspaper articles or you get magazine articles or even it comes down to when you do interviews .and if you do interviews on -- for tv shows , you keep it all in one package .and when you have somebody who might be a potential sponsor , they 're going to want to learn as much about you as they can .a lot of times , they might be so far away that they ca n't come and get a one-on-one with you , but by having a packet together that you can pass on , that gives them a little bit of an idea of what you 're all about .mainly , you can mail a hundred of those out and not have one hit , but if you mail one out to the right person that might be the hit .so do n't just mass mail people .too often , everybody 's getting hit up for money .and a lot of times , the first thing , when they hear anything about , `` hey , i want money for -- to go racing , '' they 're going to shutdown because you 've lost sight of what you actually are .you 're there as a billboard for them. [CLS] [SEP]so you really need to tell them straight upfront what you have to offer .you need to know also who your audience is .there 's statistics out there that you can get , demographics that will tell you what percentage of our fan base is male , what percentage is female , what are the age groups. [CLS] [SEP], where is it the most popular .those kinds of things are going to help you when it comes to selling your racing program .and also you need to come to them and tell them what you can provide for them : will you do appearances ?will you host people at the track ?do you do any other events ?through a lot of activities away from the track , that 's where i get the majority of the exposure that i got , and it 's mainly through word of mouth from person to person , working with good , strong organizations that are very active in the community and active also in the internet .as -- if i do an event with them and they are putting that on their web site , that in return is helping me out .so it 's kinda one of these compounded things .the best way though is stick with things that you really believe in .stick with companies you believe in .and if you 're going to do charities , stick with that 'cause it 's got to be sincere .if you 're doing it with the thought that `` i 'm going to go help this organization 'cause it 's going to bring me money over here , '' then i 'd say you 're pretty much dead in the water because that not only comes off badly , it 'll come off badly for your sponsors .so stay genuine to where your heart is. [CLS] [SEP]
here 's another shot that comes up quite often in pool .we 've got both balls , our cue ball and our object ball , both frozen to a rail on the same side of the table .now the obvious way to make this shot if we want to pocket this ball into that corner pocket .the obvious way would be just to stroke it right down the rail to contact that point .problem is , generally on most tables , they 're not player friendly in the case that you can actually get that cue ball to stay on that rail .what happens is , a lot of time , with some of these places you go into where the cloth has really been played on a lot , really worn a lot .it has a track along here , where the base of the ball rides around these rails .it will build up a track that the ball wants to stay in .and then , when it gets over , if it 's coming down the rail like so it gets over to the side pocket. [CLS] [SEP]and it has a tendency to want to roll right into the side which means then it comes over here. [CLS] [SEP]and it hits that corner and bounces out. [CLS] [SEP]and you miss the shot .so , what we want to look at real quick is a way to actually make this shot by using a curve .just a slight curve shot .and this is going to be one of those shots where we 're going to deviate from the general rule of a level cue .we 're going to come up just a little bit and back .and , when we do that , we 're going to aim out this way just a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to use just a little bit of right hand english .there .
ta. [CLS] [SEP]ithi , na , tri , ki , te , te .ta , ithi , na , tri , ki , te ,te .dhai , dhai , na , tri , ki , dhin , na .as you saw her head movement , coordinated with her arms and the feet .and now we show you step five , to the same notes .ta , ithi , na , tri , ki , te , te .ta , ithi , na , tri , ki , te ,te .ta , ithi , na , tri , ki , te ,te .dhai , dhai , na , tri , ki , dhin , na .in this clip , we 're going to show you steps seven and eight .the notes for step seven are dha , dhi , na .dha , dha , dhi , na .ta , ti , na .ta , ta , ti , na .and the step starts with chauk .and we go , dha , dhi , na .dha , dha , dhi , na .ta , ti , na .ta , ta , ti , na .
why is he playing the nine ?so that pretty much is giving you information that you can , and then he plays small , small .so now you play the king and low and behold your partner plays the six of diamonds .okay , these are the plays , this has already been played .the king and now the six .so now that tells you that you can play the ten and say the queen comes out and on the third round your partner plays the three .so now you play this , another ten or perhaps the opponent stuffs the queen or the jack under the king .now your partner has now played the three of diamonds .so that 's very wonderful because now you can play the deuce of diamonds in complete comfort .your partner has basically walked the suit down for you .so he 's telling you. [CLS] [SEP], do n't worry about that deuce of diamonds , that 's not going to hurt me .i can now take a discard .let 's just say for example , he discards the king of hearts under that deuce of diamonds. [CLS] [SEP]okay. [CLS] [SEP]and he trumps it , and he shifts say , to a trump .say he plays the four of spades .what is your job ?well , you want to play the , you can take a chance and hope your partner did n't go into nil with a jack , queen , or king. [CLS] [SEP]but , the point is , is that he probably did n't .it would n't make any sense while the spade suit is masked here .so you 're going to take the ace of spades .now it gets a little bit dicey because , if you take the ace of spades you 're faced with these two leads , but how many tricks does your partner expect you to pick up for him ?he showed a bad club , say on that ace of spades he decides to drop the nine spot .still you do n't want to touch this suit because the bottom cards are low. [CLS] [SEP]so you play the ten of spades. [CLS] [SEP]and you 've done the best job you could to cover your partners nil .your partner will guide you , you assume your partner did n't go in for a bad nil .you 've got a five bid in front of you. [CLS] [SEP], chances are the opponents are going to be thinking about making their hand .so keep in mind , cover your partner , when you 're covering a nil lead high cards and give your partner a chance to take discards .
time now for a trivia question regarding bandages .let me extricate it here from its paper prison .and the question .what is the fear of doctors called ?this is multiple choice , inverse alphabetical order .is that sciaphobia , nephaphobia , iatraphobia or blenophobia ?now the prize , the only prize for the correct answer is one pat on the back that you 'll have to administer yourself .which is a heck of a lot better than a slap on the belly with a wet trout !now , what is your answer on that ?sciaphobia ?no .it 's iatraphobia .for the record sciaphobia , the fear of shadows , nephaphobia , the fear of clouds and blenophobia , the fear of slime .just in case you 're ever on that millionaire show or jeopardy .now we have a recent study from england , that indicates that some individuals are actually addicted to wearing bandages .these are often cases of individuals who had some surgical procedure or serious injury where bandages were applied .and they 've now become addicted to wearing them .in one case a woman was wearing them for twenty-two consecutive years .now it is n't a problem .bandages are n't that expensive .however a few individuals apparently have been sneaking into hospitals to get high quality bandages for their addiction .now you might ask .how would you know if someone has a bandage addiction ?well perhaps you might see them walking down the street with a bandage on their nose .and perhaps , if i can get this off , just to give you an idea of how you 'd know if someone has a bandage addiction .so you see someone walking down the street , like this .suspect strongly that that individual is addicted to wearing bandages .yes !
hi , i 'm rokosz , your digital lifestyle expert .let me show you how to hook your pc up to your tv , which can be very useful if you want to show internet videos , you 've got a nice television at home. [CLS] [SEP]or you 're doing a business presentation. [CLS] [SEP], it 's a good thing .now there 's several different ways to get it out .the way we 've hooked this one up right now is using a super video connection .now s video is what 's going to come out of the back here. [CLS] [SEP]and i 've already just gone ahead and simple just plugged it in .and on this particular monitor , here on the side , is an s video input .okay .so we simply put in one side of the s video connector in here and the other side in there .now if you want to get audio with it , it 's a separate connector .you 're going to use something like this .it 's going to look like a headphone jack on one side and on the other side , it 's going to have two prongs , one for your left and your right audio .okay .so all i 'm going to do here is on our pc ,i 'm going to plug it into the headphone jack and now on this particular monitor. [CLS] [SEP], super video is only offered on the side input .so i 'm just going to slip it in right in here .and i 'm going to do red for right and white for left .and now we 've got sound coming out here. [CLS] [SEP], we 've got the other one coming out there .now , some of the older models will use a dvi or a vga .now if you do n't have a , miss right over again , if you do n't have super video out , alright , you want to make sure that your monitor , some of the more modern , modern monitors , have a dvi input or they have a vga input in which case you just use a double sided unit to put it on in there .if it does n't , some of the computers like apple and some of the pcs have a general purpose input , which means kind of a weird connection somewhere on the side of the computer. [CLS] [SEP]and you could buy little connectors to put in there .so , one side it 's the specially little connector , on the other side. [CLS] [SEP]it 's component , composite , vga , sdi. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're just trying to match on what you want to do there .so it 's literally hooking a direct to direct and then on the tv choosing the proper input. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's how you hook you pc up to your tv .i 'm rokosz , your digital lifestyle expert saying , `` stream you later '' .
what i 'll be performing here is a zottman dumbbell preacher curl , which is different from the traditional dumbbell preacher curl .what 's different from it , is when you bring the dumbbell up and squeeze it .after you squeeze it , you 're going to turn the dumbbell around palms facing down to the ground and controlling it still .and , then at the bottom of the motion you want to turn your wrist around palms up and curl it back up again .so , again twist it on top palms facing down .control it going down .on the bottom of the motion , twist it palms facing up .and , you want to do about three sets to about eight to ten reps with this motion .control it .bring it up .flex the biceps .and , then you want to go ahead alternate it .flex the biceps .switch the angle , palms down .on the bottom switch it , palms up .squeeze the bicep .and , that 's how you perform the zottman dumbbell preacher curl .
o.k .i 've hit. [CLS] [SEP]let 's say either a not so good shot. [CLS] [SEP]but sometimes i 've hit the ball great. [CLS] [SEP]and it just takes a bad bounce and lands up against a tree and. [CLS] [SEP]so in this situation , you may be entitled to a drop .but most likely , you 're just going to have to get up to the ball and figure out a way to pop it out of there .so sometimes these types of lies are where strokes can mount up because there 's no good way .i ca n't take the full swing. [CLS] [SEP], it 's up against the tree the trunk of the tree. [CLS] [SEP]so we ca n't hit at it .so trees are something that can cause you a lot of trouble and they 're best to be avoided .whether you 're trying to hit through them. [CLS] [SEP]it seems that the branches and the leaves really can knock down a lot of balls .so trees are best to be avoided but if you do get around trees or in trees every now. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 'll get a nice channel to get out of them. [CLS] [SEP]and you 'll have a shot .but a lot time all you have to do all you can do is just try to take this ball that 's behind the tree and just pitch it back onto the fairway .so that 's all you can do. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's one of the unfortunate things in golf. [CLS] [SEP]but it happens even to the top pros .
next , we 're going to continue building. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to build our wall around the outside of the sandcastle .that 's your protection for anything that is inside your castle .we going to use your basic preformed shapes by packing sand in them and creating a perimeter around the outside connecting all four corners of the wall .once again , we 're going to hand pack into the shape .make sure you use plenty of water .the more water the better .it will help it when you try to dump it out .and i 'm going to start in the middle and work my way around the wall .once again , you squeeze it a couple of times to get the sand loose , and carefully pull it off .and now we 've completed our outside wall to our sandcastle .
and basically he 's putting his weight down on his groin and this is a little bit more of an advanced stretch , but. [CLS] [SEP]what he 's doing is he 's taking his arms. [CLS] [SEP]and he 's pushing out as well. [CLS] [SEP]and he 's really getting ; making sure that this inner leg and the groin and the abductor muscles are really going to get warmed up and really stretched out .again one , two , three , one .one , two , three , two .one , two , three , three .it 's a great way to stretch. [CLS] [SEP]and then what you 'll do is once he gets to ten , he 'll go ahead a break .go ahead and stand up. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll go ahead and drop him down on the ground and what he 's going to do is the butterfly stretch .and he 's going to pull his feet in and again. [CLS] [SEP], he 's going to push down with the legs .and he 's going to really make sure that he 's warmed up and that he 's stretched in the area because once those ; once the abductors and the groin muscles become agitated , it takes a long time to recover from and you 're not going to perform the same ; not for quite some time .so , you really want to make sure .one , two , three , one .one , two , three , two .one , two , three , three .and again go on to ten .it 's not an actual ten seconds .it 's a little bit longer , but again there 's no race to a good stretching and warming up .
the very first thing is everyone antes one red chip .you can have your ante be whatever you want .say five pennies .and i am going to deal five cards to every player at the table .and now the key thing about skinny minnie is that it 's played high/low .so your may not be so great as a high hand but be a good low hand .and that 's something to consider .now we have a betting round .and let 's say the player to my left checks .and we look at your hand and. [CLS] [SEP]you have , you actually have middling cards .and i want to stress that in a came that 's high/low. [CLS] [SEP], it 's best to not play middling hands .but we are going to go ahead and proceed with this hand for demonstration purposes .so , you 'll check .this player checks .and you checked because you 're hoping to see the draw for free .and i 'm going to go ahead and check. [CLS] [SEP]and you will see the draw for fee .
small real , real small. [CLS] [SEP]it 's going to be delicious .i 'm going to wash my knife here ,i 'm chopping it up really thin because i do n't want to see it in my rice .that is why i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]using a bigger knife to get really small pieces in there , meanwhile my bacon is cooking back there .still not crispy it 's soft. [CLS] [SEP], you want to keep an eye on that make sure that it 's not getting overcooked or that it is not cooked yet .come back over here. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to chop this up .
if you want to transition into gymnastic from a different sport , it 's kind of hard to get your flexibility if you have n't started from a younger age .i started when i was probably 5 , learning how to do the splits. [CLS] [SEP]and then i got my strength for doing bars and doing the beams and doing my cartwheels in the outfield .i definitely think that you can transition to gymnastics if you do work on that flexibility everyday .
so once you purchased your tea and you put it in the right place , you have to know how much tea can you make before you have to go buy some more .some teas are very dense .for example the masala chai is made of mainly herbs and it 's black tea leaves. [CLS] [SEP]that 's a bit heavy , so when you scoop it out , it looks this little , but. [CLS] [SEP]this brews a full 16 oz . [CLS] [SEP]cup of tea .so a 2 oz . [CLS] [SEP]cup , a 2 oz . [CLS] [SEP]container of tea will go a quite a long way , fifteen or twenty five cups of tea .and you might not realize this but loose leaf tea when it 's high quality , you can get two , three , four , five infusions out of the same tea leaves .the oolong that i mentioned , that tea can go for about ten , fifteen brews .you get the best oolong , twenty five infusions .not crazy ?well , you get a white tea that 's volume ease. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's light. [CLS] [SEP], you 're going to need a full tbsp .of tea , which means that the huge bag , that when you purchase it , it comes out to be this big , but you can only make the same amount of cups of tea , fifteen to twenty cups of tea .just because it 's denser , does n't mean you have to use more tea .
be sure the dog understands in the beginning what 's expected with the trick , so they do n't move or strain their body too quickly .once the dog does this on a regular routine , repetition , exercise format , it 's going to be just as easy as getting your dog to sit .so most importantly , a soft , a soft mat , or a soft , soft bedding , is going to be a , is going to be the best way to ensure safety for your dog .
i have also have the poblano chilies that we roasted , pan roasted and we let them steam .i 'm going to just pull the stems off of those , you can leave the seeds in .the seeds add a little bit more heat , you can take them out to depending on how much heat you want .we can always add more spice but you can not take it out something to keep in mind when working with peppers .also wash your hands very well after you handle them before touching your eye .i 'm also going to add 1 of my chipotle peppers and these are very very spicy .so that is going to spice them up and then into the food processor. [CLS] [SEP]and we would puree that .i 'm also going to add some chicken stock which is going to help the pureeing process .probably for all those peppers , i 'm going to use about a half a cup of chicken stock .now you can see , we have puree peppers .those are spicy !
once you 've mastered both your toe and heelside edges , you 're going to want to get on the chair lift and really give it a go .you want to be with only one foot strapped in , so you want to go back to skating .you 're going to skate up to the lift line and get on .show them your ticket and skate up to the chair lift .you want to wait behind the chair .there will be a red line to show you were to stop .and , just follow your lifty 's cues as to when to sit down .keep your legs straight as you 're leaving the snow , so it does n't get tangled under the chair .and , you can put it on top of your other foot. [CLS] [SEP]so you 're nice and comfortable .that 's how you get on a chair lift .now , you 've just got to enjoy the ride .
ok.the general shapes are coming out .once again , in order to help separate this from the background use contrast .contrast is our friend .so , enhance the contrast wherever necessary in order to help separate this from the background and make it stand out .i am now using black and because i 've got a lot of pastel already on this board. [CLS] [SEP]the black is n't ever going to get real black .because , it 's mixing with the other colors .but , watch how see how that makes the cat stand out from the background. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's also providing some weight and making it sit on this cloth .
most of the sugar melted and some sugar stayed on top .and i want to show you. [CLS] [SEP]i did n't mix it. [CLS] [SEP], all this liquid came out of the fruit .there 's a lot of sugar on the bottom which became hard because of the juice .that 's why it 's important to leave it with same pot that we 're going to cook it with because it will be hard , not impossible but hard to remove it to a different pot .fruits have different amount of pectin in it .pectin is what makes the mixture gel .in our case plums have a good amount of pectin in it. [CLS] [SEP]so we do n't need to add any pectin which sometimes you want to add it comes as a powder .we also leave the peel of the fruit on it cause it adds a nice amount of pectin to the the mixture .as you can see i did n't fill up the pot to the top .because when it start boiling the mixture might run over and we do n't want this mess. [CLS] [SEP]but you can fill it up a little bit more than i did .i just wanted to add that 24 hours is the best time. [CLS] [SEP]but if after 10 hours you can see the juice there 's a nice amount of juice and most of the sugar dissolved already. [CLS] [SEP]it 's fine to start cooking .if you want to leave it a little bit longer it fine to because sugar is a natural preservative .but you do n't want to wait to long because the fruit my start forminting .
hi !my name is jesus cardoso , and i ’ m going to teach you how to decide on how loud should a vocal track be in the mix .first of all , we need to consider what style of music are we talking about .many times for rock , it is very good to have a vocal track as loud as the guitarist .the guitarists are the ones that basically give the rock feel to the song .in rock bands , nobody likes to have the vocals as loud as the guitarist .if we ’ re talking about pop , the vocal normally tries to stand out a little bit from everything else .especially , if we ’ re talking about a song where the artist or the singer is the main person .let ’. [CLS] [SEP]s say. [CLS] [SEP]christina aguilera , then you really want to put the vocal right on top of everything else .just make sure that if you ’ re mixing everything together so the vocal doesn ’ t stand too much from it , always try to make sure that every single word that has been sung through this piece can be perfectly heard and understood .
the phoenix monkey is one of the hardest freestyle maneuvers in a hole .what the paddler does is reach across their bow to cast water on the power face of your paddle .you 're then going to do a pirouette .once i get back to facing forward again , i 'm going to reach up to the sky and initiate a loop , tuck forward , throw my loop , and finish with my paddle behind me .a lot of the motion gets done off this one blade .the pirouette pulls me around , and then at the tail end of the loop i can pull this paddle backwards to throw my feet back in front of me .with the phoenix monkey the goal is to really stay right close to the hole .different holes are easier or harder to do these in , so find a good hole .find that sweet spot of the hole , move around , try it in different locations .
today i 'm going to talk to you all about the history of lavender .so , the name lavender comes from the latin name `` lavare '' which means to wash.and , it was used quite a bit in the olden days by romans as a dressing on their wounds during wars .but , there 's a lot of references to lavender in the bible using the name `` spikenard . [CLS] [SEP]''in fact , there was a reference to mary magdalene using spikenard to wash jesus ' feet and adam and eve using lavender to , as they escaped the garden of eden .so , the first record of remedial properties back in a.d. [CLS] [SEP]77 , it was considered a cure all for things like menstrual problems , upset stomach , kidney disorders and jaundice .in fact , in the middle ages , monks and nuns were known for using the herb to make medicine , in fact , it was found in king tut 's tomb in nineteen twenty two , and it had been sealed and it still smelled like lavender when they found lavender inside of his tomb .so , today lavender is used for quite a few things , just like it was back in the olden days .in fact , it 's very popular today as a culinary herb .people use it for decoration in their home , and the modern day. [CLS] [SEP]roman therapist use it quite a bit to calm nerves when they 're using their treatments .if you want more information about lavender , go to the internet and look up these different topics .
in this example i 'm going to show another variation of alternate melody , this time in addition to pinches , throwing in a hammer on and again using some open strings and. [CLS] [SEP]some just simply finger picked within the chord .in this example : i 'm going to play up to speed at first , and it sounds like this .so , what i 'm doing there is starting with the pinch and the hammer on and then basically doing what we call a banjo roll , which is simply going back and forth .so , i 'm going .and , then ending with a c pinch .so , back up to speed , i 'm going .you can also do something like that , just end with a nice little hammer on , where you 're pinching and hammering on and getting that nice ring of c out there .so , that 's essentially another finger stop pattern with a hammer on , pinches and little banjo rolls .
alright , so on this tutorial i 'm going to touch base on contrast .my contrast is something i like to do to always. [CLS] [SEP]every one of my photos and. [CLS] [SEP]this is probably the last thing i do when i 'm done with my curves and saturation and color balance .i usually go to the contrast button and there is no shortcut for contrast , so you just have to go into your image - mode , and then adjustments and then this little dialog box will come up .now , contrast is something that every photograph , especially digital needs .because every digital file is basically flat right out of the camera. [CLS] [SEP]and it always needs. [CLS] [SEP]just a little tad bit of contrast .now the image that i have here is already is already a finished image .i 've already completely added my saturation and messed with my curves and messed with my contrast .but , for this little tutorial i 'm going to just use the image .you got two different options in the brightness and contrast dialog box .you have first one which is brightness , which i never ever use. [CLS] [SEP]and i do n't ever recommend it for anything .if you want to brighten your image use curves or use the levels , but do not use brightness .it 's just for some reason , it 's just funky .it brings noise and it makes your picture look horrible .so , just do not do it .one thing i do like to use though. [CLS] [SEP]is contrast .so , what you do is just slide your contrast over and. [CLS] [SEP]as you can see my picture just got a lot more contrasted .if i hit the preview button you can see there , you can see the before and after .it just pops out just a little bit more than what it was .and i actually like the look of contrasty colors in a picture .it just makes it pop a whole bunch more and when you get a print back. [CLS] [SEP]it just looks so much better .usually that is the problem with most photographs .they do n't have enough contrast to make the blacks look black and the whites look white .in contrast usually you have to do more with the blacks than whites , but as you can see here contrast is a fairly easy tool to use .although , it is a very helpful tool to use and it 's very effective and it 's very important that you do use the contrast tool on every one of your photographs .now there is another way to get to contrast and to saturation. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's through this button down over here. [CLS] [SEP]where i 'm at .if you click on that you can actually individually work on the layer that has curves .an individual layer that has contrast and that 's something that i can touch base on later , but for now i 'm just going to stick with what i 've shown you .thanks .
the little separation in between the two hands in between the activity what we are doing with the two hands .we learned already how to play with two balls in one hand .but we have n't used so far the other hand during all this time .of course you can make a lot of different kind of separation. [CLS] [SEP]not only this one .then you have two ball in one hand and one ball in the other hand .but as an introduction , we do now like that .so i have the two ball in one , in my hand .i throw them .and i just start to play with my other hand .this is the easiest way at the moment .so what i 'm doing with this hand that i only move it up and down .and i 'm likely to follow one of my ball .so now i always follow the ball what i throw in the first .so the separation is exactly this .i have one hand what is doing some activity .my right hand is just doing the throws but at the same time my left hand is going up and down , moving the ball in harmony with one of the other balls .
it 's going to involve overhand punch into a pancake throw off of a basic grip .this is good for a combat sambo competition where you wear the jacket or you could use this in mma as well with no jacket .so from here , we 're going to use our overhand punch as an entrance for our underhook to do the throw .okay ?i have a grip on his sleeve ; he 's got a grip. [CLS] [SEP]my lapel , overhand punch , continue the motion , underhook , i 'm going to sit on my weight .okay , now i 'll show it to you again in real time , overhand to a pancake .okay .so , again , what 's important here , like all combinations , is that you continue your motion .
okay so as you can see we 've completed our candlesticks here .and you can see how they will look when there 's a candle inside of them .very nice presentation .so there are a few things i 'd like to review in regards to preparing for the first firing .which is the bisque firing .first of all , this is the last time we 're going to be able to do any tooling .so any kind of decoration you want to do where you 're gouging into the clay or making marks , now 's the time to do it .i 'll flip it over and put my name into the side of it .which i like to do with all of my parts .to show you how the clay is still workable .and the date .may sixth .in preparing these to dry these , it is important to know that you want them to dry out nice and evenly .often times the tops will dry out too quickly .you can actually develop cracks in the clay if this happens .so you do n't want that .so if you 're in a very dry environment you might want to take a spray bottle and simply spray them down .if it 's really dry you might want to put some paper towel around it and put plastic on it .you just want to understand that the clay wants to dry out nice and evenly .when it 's dry. [CLS] [SEP]it 's going to look like this .as you can see , when i scratch this it 's hard to tool and does n't make very nice marks .but when it gets like this , it 's ready to go into the kilt and bisquified .which is the first firing in the process of making ceramic ware .so now these are completed and ready to go on to my drying rack .i do hope you 've enjoyed joining me in my studio and making candlesticks .join us again on expert village and learn how to make a variety of different types of ceramic ware .
now bring your head back. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's supported on the ball .arms straight up over your head .now keeping your elbows pointed up towards the ceiling , bend at the elbow .so you 're bending as much as you can .and then you 're going to straighten up and squeeze hard in the back of the arms .your triceps , your three muscles which run up the back of your arms , and what they do , they straighten out your arms , so making sure to bend and straight as much as possible will make this a tricep specific exercise .keep breathing. [CLS] [SEP], if you 're hard core , breath out when you bring the dumbbells up , otherwise just make sure to keep breathing .these are tricep extensions on the balance ball .they 're also going to help your core because you got to keep your entire body tight. [CLS] [SEP]so you do n't fall off the ball .
on this bracelet , we 're going to have a skull that we 're going to attach with a split ring .a split ring is like a key ring .it goes around in a circle and has an end that you use to attach the charm .what i do is stick my fingernail in between the wires on the split ring and just roll .twist it through .this way your charm is going to dangle on your bracelet. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to look really cool .i try not to use the other kind of rings because they come apart .the charms have a tendency to come off .if you use a split ring , they 're going to be more secure as well as dangle .it 's going to make it look really nice .
i 'm here to answer the question. [CLS] [SEP], how do you change your identity ?well the answer is really ,you ca n't , legally .yes i know there are a lot of internet sites that promise to help you change your identity for a specific fee , but the bottom line is you ca n't really change your identity .yes you can change your name , you can change your social security card number , but short of the witness protection program with the federal government , there is no way you can change your identity , so you got to keep that in mind .now , if you really do want to change your identity , perhaps the best thing to do is change your name legally , which is another legal process , take up a different profession , a different line of work , move away , change the way you walk , change your habits , and that sort of thing , and that 's really the only way you 're going to change your identity .i 'm robert todd , and thank you for watching .
so now what we 're going to do is get our shoulder dimensions , our shoulder dimensions , and that is going to be from the back from the shoulder seam here and the shoulder seam here , the fullness between the two , and you 're going to need someone to help you out because it 's going to go from down there all the way across to there .and i 'll draw it out. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's much clearer , how to get the exact dimension and where to place the measuring tape .it 's going to start here at your shoulder seam. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to go across the fullest part of your back to the other side. [CLS] [SEP]and then whatever is in this dimension , across here , which is your shoulder dimension .
the next one of our moves is going to be a double arm bar .this position is done from someone getting hold of your shoulders .okay .so this where melissa is grabbing to my shoulders this way .again , this action is very simple to perform .i 'm going to bring both of my hands through the inside of her arms this way , okay .as you do it , this is a wedging action .this wedging action is going to loosen the grip this way .i 'm going to circle the arms around this way and pull them into my body .from the in position , my hands rotate up , okay , so i 'm locking her palms under my armpits , my forearms are in her elbows .now from here i lean my body up and lift our arms this way .now this one you have to be very careful as you 're working with your partner , `` go ahead and grab again melissa '' , because they do n't have a hand free to go ahead and tap .so you have to perform this one go ahead light and easy .if you go too fast , they have nothing to tap. [CLS] [SEP]so you do n't know. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to keep squeezing. [CLS] [SEP], you 're going to hurt your partner .one last time , up , around .now you see that i make contact that do n't loose .i 'm not going like this .okay .i ca n't lose grip. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm going this way , `` shooh '' , in .okay .grabbing , lifting and squeezing .so this is standing grappling double arm bar .
 , they feel like they 're driven by a motor , they feel that it 's never quiet in their heads .this is where complications with sleep can happen with adhd .the minute you lay down to try and rest. [CLS] [SEP]is when every commercial jingle you know starts running through your head .a good way to start learning quiet time is to engage in meditation activities , and practice meditation , and i say practice meditation because it takes practice .it 's not an overnight fix to anything .by learning meditation and mindfulness we can start to become aware of the state of our heads , the state of our brains , and get a sense of. [CLS] [SEP], this is what i 'm feeling. [CLS] [SEP], i feel energized , i feel motorized .there 's a lot of sound in my head and by exercising , breathing , and meditation skills , we can actually learn to control the amount of noise in our head , and the amount of motorization in our day to day lives , and in our feelings .i think it 's essential for someone with adhd to seek quiet , and learn to seek calm .
now , i will show how to sew the strips on to our carpet .i 've already started sewing the strips on as you can see .what you do is you take the folded strip that has already been cut and lay it , start right at that starting line , and lay it right along our one inch marker .if you want , you can put in pins to hold it in place .and remove the pins as you sew .and then you put it on the machine , using a normal stitch , at 2 1/2 stitch length .you want to sew like right about 1/4 inch here on the edge .you are going to sew right along that fold and keep the edge right up to the line that 's been marked .so start by backing up a bit .now , remember that you 're using a heavy needle , a jeans needle , or heavy duty needle , depending upon what your machine instructions call for .and remove the pins as you go .and continue down until the end .and then you sew on all of the strips in the same way .all folding flat in one direction .now i am going to show you what to do as your carpet gets longer. [CLS] [SEP]and it gets more difficult to put in to the machine .you 'll want to roll the excess up like this .roll this up to sew the next panel .okay .that makes it a lot easier to manage .okay .and the other thing that you can do is to turn ,when you get to the half way point , we have about half of the rug done , turn the carpet over .and now this part is going to be the part that goes under .and it 's a lot more manageable .just place your next strip going in the other direction so that they are all going the right way and continue .
in this video , i 'm going to be talking about juggling three balls in one hand .this is a hard trick .this actually might not work very well until after you 've mastered four or five balls , even .but conceptually , the trick 's very easy .all you 're doing is juggling three in one hand .just like you juggled two , you 're going to add a third one , and they 're all going to go a lot higher and a lot faster .so just show you what this looks like .three in one hand looks something like that .if you remember from when we learned four balls , this is actually a fountain pattern .that is , each throw is moving from the center to the outside .there are other patterns you can use .another common one is cascade .if you remember , the normal three ball cascade is just like this .we just throw across and side to side .you can do the same thing with just one hand .again it 's very high , it 's very stretched out vertically , but it looks something like this .if you can tell , it might be a little hard at first , but the balls are actually traveling in a cascade pattern and my hand is moving side to side underneath , throwing up to the right , then up to the left .when you practice this trick , just really give yourself enough time .throw those balls high , try and get them all the same height and all the same timing .practice it a lot .and this is a difficult trick , but when you incorporate it into a normal three ball pattern , people are very impressed .
what we 're going to talk about and discuss , is how to properly inspect the firefighting part of the ensemble , known as protective hand wear or the glove .the gloves are a very important part of the ensemble where there should be no holes whatsoever or no loose stitching .gloves can wear out rather quickly under heavy use and mechanical damage .as we can pull and tug on each part of the seams to make sure our stitching is all intact , we can go over each finger one at a time to make sure that we do not have a hole or a problem in those areas .we then want to inspect to make sure our inner liner and thermal barrier stitching is still intact .on some gloves , there 's a short gauntlet made of nomex , that also needs to be intact , and now on these gloves , there 's not .we take these gloves to inspect them and feel to make sure all the fingers are intact while again inspecting for any holes or physical damage and to make sure none of the fingers and the inner liner has pulled free from them. [CLS] [SEP]so we can quickly don them inside of a heat filled environment .the glove , very important part of a firefighting ensemble , should be inspected after every fire .
you have this great big bowl and what if you only have a half of cup to cream to whip or two or three egg whites .that is what only that is the speed is for your mixer .it 's a little bit harder to over whip something when you have a small amount of it .so this is what the fastest speed is going to be for it 's going to be able to get into small amounts of egg whites or cream .so that you can whip it up properly even if you do n't have a half of bowl full .so we 're going to turn it all the way up to ten. [CLS] [SEP]and you can see how much faster this is working on a small amount of egg whites .whereas we only had it at eight the egg whites were taking a lot longer to whip part of that. [CLS] [SEP]is because the power and part of it is also because having a more powerful beater beating a small amount is going to work better than a slower speed .that is what the highest setting of your mixer is for so you can whip up even the small amount of materials without having to get a smaller bowl .
and now we 're going to talk about `` looming shade '' .`` looming shade '' [ technical ] and now we 're going to discuss `` looming shade '' .`` looming shade '' is out of the basic set .it has been around since the beta .it is the creature `` shade '' .once again , `` shades '' were very very popular when magic first got started .it is a common card , which means you can find it in your booster packs or at any gaming store for 20 to 25 cents , and `` looming shade '' cost you 2 and a black to play , which means its converted mana cost is 3.now , with the converted mana cost of 3 , you 're getting a 1/1 , which once again , you 're paying 2 extra for a 1/1 , which means that it 's going to have an ability .the ability on looming shade is very powerful because if you pay 1 black , looming shade gets +1/+1 until end of turn .now what this means is that , as long as you have black mana , you can play this. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's not a tap ability , which means you can pump as much black mana into this creature as much as you want .and if you say , `` pump nine swamps , '' and tap them , `` looming shade '' will get plus 9 , plus 9 , which will make him a 10/10 , which would make him a very large and very power creature , and once again , he only cost you 3 to put in and then he would at least be able to be pumped up at least by 3 , so therefore , for 3. [CLS] [SEP], you 're getting a 4/4 as long as you spend the mana .
okay our next step is going to be is to clean this piece of wood where we 've got the patch out .it has to be very , very clean. [CLS] [SEP]and it has to be especially clean around the edges .so i 'm going to take my little pointy knife , and go inside the edge , very carefully , and cut little fibers and little chunks of glue and debris and just cut around and clean out around this edge .then i 'll take a chisel , and go over the interior of the patch , making sure i get off all the old glue and get down to bare wood .come back with the chisel , just very gently .you do n't want to lift up the veneer that surrounds this. [CLS] [SEP]or you 'll have to make another patch , so be very careful about this .sometimes i like to take the chisel and pull it instead of pushing it , kind of use it like a pencil and clean , clean , clean .so we have this all nice and clean now , and now we 're gon na install the patching and. [CLS] [SEP]this time i 'm going to use super glue .
okay in this next section we 're going to go ahead and remove our tail pipe. [CLS] [SEP]so let ?s go ahead and get started on that .we 're going to remove our bottom bolts. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 're going to remove our u bracket and take off the whole pipe , the exhaust and the lower pipe .okay. [CLS] [SEP]so first we 're going to go ahead and take off. [CLS] [SEP], there 's a bolt. [CLS] [SEP]right here , we 're going to go ahead and take , loosen this , but we 're not going to take off the clamp all the way because we are going to reuse it .so i got ,i 'm using a 12 millimeter with an extension and a wrench and lets go ahead and take this off .so just get it real loose but do n't take it off all the way .alright so go ahead and squeeze that bolt out and this will be nice and loose and then leave that on there because we 're going to reuse it for our new pipe .okay. [CLS] [SEP]so now we 're going to go ahead. [CLS] [SEP]and , we 've got the bottom pipe moved , we 're going to go ahead and take off this whole section .we 've only got one more bolt holding it on. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's going to be this one. [CLS] [SEP]so we 're going to use a 12 millimeter with our wrench and torque it to the left .alright you can go ahead and take that out and set it in a nice safe spot .alright. [CLS] [SEP]so let 's go ahead and take off our tail section now .we 've got it all loose .there we go .pull it all the way out to the side and first we 're going to wiggle it loose .we do n't want to pull it too hard and break anything .there we go .that 'll come off just like that .and there is your stock exhaust and go ahead and set that to the side .
and he 's off balance trying to make a tackle on the quarterback and the quarterback will either step up in the pocket or scramble to the outside .the defensive tackle worked that hard for nothing .we want to make sure we break down .on this play , we 'll have a running back coming hard to his right side .if the defensive guy does n't first take a good angle and then break down that running back will run out around .the running backs will always be faster and quicker than the defensive tackles .we 're going to show what this looks like when he gets in the backfield ( video demo ) .he breaks through , he 's going to get out , he does a great job of breaking down .he did n't just run by the play and let this guy cut back inside of him .he gets outside , he breaks down , then he explodes up and makes a good tackle .you have to do that in order to be a good defensive tackle or you 'll waste a lot of effort for nothing .
welcome back , we 're in a lotus 111 car this time , it differs from the ninety-six elise in that it has a little more horse power , but the layout is the same , so you want to use the same techniques that you learned using the other lotus and apply it to this lotus .so here we go , same thing as the other lotus , it does n't have much power , but it does have a little more -so you have to be careful with your throttling. [CLS] [SEP], it 's a little more in this car than in the other car .steering is pretty much the same , technique of lift-off works really well for these type of cars , so you want to still practice lift-off over steer in these mrs because that 's simply what they like to do .so control your entry speed into corners , that does n't change .control your steering and your throttle , that does n't change .it 's just the initial feel of an mr car is different than the other drive trains .so use your power , what you have to get through , remember lift-off works really well for mr cars , so use that technique , see , lift-off , and just turn right around the corner .come to this fast corner , watch your speed as always , you do n't want to over speed into these corners like that .that was too much steering input .so here you go , we 're going to lift off the first second , watch it with the accelerator .so use throttle control in this car , it 's not as important as the following cars that we 'll cover , but it is a good habit to use feather throttle if you 're not sure at the corner , check your speed .feather. [CLS] [SEP]the throttle when you need to get the back out a little more .you have to be very smooth in these cars. [CLS] [SEP]otherwise you 're not going to be on the right line and that will prevent you from drifting through a section cleanly ,so these mr cars are more about trying to be smooth with the smooth line rather than using the power to get around the corner like you did in an fr car .so practice using lift-off technique in this car as well , it 's an mr platform. [CLS] [SEP]so you 're going to slide around and maybe spin out quite a bit more than an fr car if you are steering intensely .so keep your steering inputs small in these engine wheel drive cars and they will reward you with nice , long , beautiful drifts , so try attacking this course one last time in this car .so use weight shifting like we talked about in fr , it 's going to be a little more touchy in this mid-engine cars simply because the weight is behind the driver and not in front of the driver like in the other fr cars .try and keep your steering inputs small and smooth .balance with the accelerator as best as you can as you get through .the more and more you drive these cars. [CLS] [SEP]the easier and easier drifting will become , because these cars do like to slide quite a bit .
alright , drink we 're about to make is called flat tire .and we 're going to make this as a shot or two .put some ice in a glass , we 're going to go ahead and chill the ingredients .make it nice and smooth when we take it down .alright , two shots of tequila .there 's one , and two , eventually .and one shot of black sambuka .there we go .stop .alright , let 's go ahead and chill those ingredients .so if you run out of jagermeister at your bar or the bar you go to does n't have jagermeister , but they happen to have tequila and black sambuka , you can go ahead and just ask for a flat tire .it 's going to taste pretty similar .okay , grab your strainer and two shot glasses , and go ahead and pour .there 's one , and two .so you see , it 's not so bad having a flat tire .bottoms up .
alright you just learned 2-5 in b major .now i am just doing 5 's .two 5 's in every key .now you can just pick out keys e flat , g flat ,b flat , c ,e flat , so it is an important tool compositionally and just to get all the scales under your fingers .so you can just go forever and. [CLS] [SEP]land right where you want b major as you go through the pianist pallet .
okay , monkeys inside out .i 've got the leg folded over .i 'm going to start close to the fold. [CLS] [SEP]right. [CLS] [SEP]cause the socks folded this way .so here 's the fold from the outside .the natural outside of the sock .i 've got my embroidery thread .i 've got a knot in the end already .i 'm just going to kind of run it right there and that will be where the knot goes and. [CLS] [SEP]like i said i am going to kind of sort of curve the stitch around and go right up. [CLS] [SEP]the in seam .so let 's see i want to flip it around a little bit .so okay. [CLS] [SEP]i am just going to kind of curve the stitch around .and you know if you use embroidery thread , embroidery thread is pretty robust you can do. [CLS] [SEP]i mean depending on who you are going to give this too .i do n't mind doing fairly course stitching .when i say fairly course. [CLS] [SEP]i mean each stitch it does n't bother me. [CLS] [SEP]each stitch is an eight inch apart or even more .you know you do n't have to get to precise with it .cause. [CLS] [SEP]like i say embroidery thread. [CLS] [SEP]i mean we are doing three strands .it 's pretty strong stuff .so i am just going to kind of stitch it here kind of around the foot .you see i am curving it a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]and if you ca n't see that i will hold it up in a second so that you can see that .okay , good .see i just kind have not really curved it. [CLS] [SEP]but i have kind of angled it around .okay. [CLS] [SEP]so there we are .so now i am just going to run this you want to make sure that these are lined up .you do n't want to get like any other project in sewing ; you do n't want to get to close to the edge .especially you know on the sock .it 's a knit material. [CLS] [SEP]so you need to kind of be careful that you do n't get to close to the edge. [CLS] [SEP]so that if it unravels that the thread will stay in it .so i am just going to finish this seam all the way up. [CLS] [SEP]and i am going to do the other side .
hi. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm seth maxwell malice , i 'm going to show you how to draw on the fly .what we 're going to talk about now is where you are going to work .i tend to work anywhere. [CLS] [SEP]i want .i 've , i escape my studio for better digs , better place to look at things , other people , other surroundings , much more interesting than staying in a stagnant room which could be your studio .which i call the room of death .so for your entertainment value , i make everything portable .i have a portable kit for my art supplies .everything is portable .hand held size pieces of paper .you name it .with this i can go on the road , i can go to a cafe .where people do n't see me drawing them ,where i do n't see them looking at me. [CLS] [SEP]drawing , it does n't even matter .there is a plethora of subject matter and everything you need .along with coffee , beer that 's good too .essentially a good surroundings makes more fun in drawing .so anyway that is what i have to say , i 've done drawings in cafes , once again in bars , essentially where you can just like sit and have a flat surface , you , yourself , your paper and the things to draw behind people 's backs .that 's the way to be a wrong artist .
after blockers have been declared , the combat damage step occurs .during this step all damage is assigned as follows .the power of any unblocked creature is assigned to the defending player , the power of creatures that have been blocked , and are blocking are assigned to each other .the grizzly bears assigned 2 damage to the honor guard ; the honor guard only assigns 1 damage , the grizzly bears .now there 's an opportunity once the damage has been assigned to activate abilities that can be played anytime instance are played .this ability can be used because there 's 2 white men available to save the honor guard from dying to the grizzly bears .at this point the ability will be activated twice giving it 0 , 2 until end of turn , this makes it a 1/3 , that means that it will survive the 2 points of damage the grizzly bears deals to it .the grizzly bears still survive because it 's only still dealing 1 point of damage to the grizzly bears .once the ability has been activated , the damage is dealt , that reduces the life total of the defending player by 1 point because the scryb sprites were n't blocked .
now we ? re going to go in to your , first off before we go any further in to anything .writing any kind of verses we ?re going to discuss bars .here goes the thing about bars .there measures there counts .i use to think that a bar was every two rhyme words when ever i was young and that 's wrong .cause sixteen bar verses then was turned into thirty two bar verses it 's a measure .like depending on the speed of the beat will be the measure .but let ?s just say it 's a regular tempo beat like. [CLS] [SEP], once again were going to go back to my favorite analogy .fifty cent .when i pull up out front. [CLS] [SEP]you see the benz on dulls. [CLS] [SEP], when i roll twenty deep it 's all we drum in the club now. [CLS] [SEP]then i roll with dre. [CLS] [SEP]all the girls show me love when you sell like m and m. [CLS] [SEP]all the groupies will show you a.that 's four bars .cause it was in his rhyme words .you see what i 'm saying ?like if you want to go back , i 'm trying to thing about some other things that i can really , cursing down the street , in my six four , clocking it , jocking it. [CLS] [SEP], you see. [CLS] [SEP]what i 'm saying that was two bars .but this way , but you know sometimes the beat might be quicker sometimes it might be like , man. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm all about that money. [CLS] [SEP], these people thing it 's funny. [CLS] [SEP], i telling about that honey .see what i 'm saying ?but it 's still got to be a measure .see what i 'm saying ?you know what i 'm saying ?so when you find your bars , this way you know exactly what you ?re going through. [CLS] [SEP]and you know the average song has sixteen bar verses .but if you trying to keep it interesting you want to just do what you feel .i know people that have spent sixteen ?s on the first verse .twelve ?s on the second verse and did eight bar bridges on the third verse .so people that did sixteen , sixteen , sixteen .people that have don two twenty four bar verses .but as a radio expert .i would tell you all to try to keep your verses between twelve and sixteen bars .never really go over just to keep it really soft .any were twelve is really is phenomenal .because it keeps you in that line in that realm of of things .and that 's how you write bars .
when you start practicing linking spins in flat water , what you 're really focusing on is the timing of when you switch your edges and when you switch the rotation of your torso to keep your body in front of your boat .when linking spins what i 'm first doing is bow pivot turn , which is a reverse sweep and sinking bow down , and then catching myself on a stern pivot turn for the next end .sinking the stern down and pulling the bow back around .this is the way that we spin in holes or just doing some nice flat spins even .the timing is really important .every time that i 'm sideways , my paddle can only be on my downstream side , and my up stream edge has to be up .anytime that i 'm in line or straight onto it , now my boat can be nice and flat .when i link spins , i begin with a lot of edge , flat in the middle , a lot of edge , flat at the end .that way i 'm continually pulling the boat around .the other that changes with our sweep strokes with this is the first pivot turn is the same .once i get to backwards , i do n't need to start all the way up my toes because it wastes time .i 'll actually start just at my hip here. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'll catch the oncoming water on my paddle , and that 'll give me the extra push to bring the boat around .starting at the hip , we already have a lot of that momentum built up from the first bow pivot , so we 're just continuing the momentum by getting a bracing sort of stroke against the current .
powerade is the main sponsor on that. [CLS] [SEP]so it 'll be the nhra powerade drag racing series schedule. [CLS] [SEP]and then you also have your lucas oil drag racing. [CLS] [SEP]and they cover all the divisional events .so as you are putting together your schedule for that year you can look at maybe the races that are close to you and also you can take into consideration if you decided to run any nationals whether the dates line up because they are not always , they do run races on the same date .so you have to choose whether you want to run the nationals or whether you want to run the divisional and. [CLS] [SEP]a lot of that is dictated , they 're pretty good about having those races really far apart .so if you 're not wanting to drive to seattle there might be a race close to you .
okay now we 're moving on to our next area in our loft .this is our dining area and here are the materials that are needed .we are using a rectangle folding table , a folding chair 2 folding chairs , a decanter a glass is for our shelf back there , some wine , a cup , a coffee maker , a container with utensils , and that stuff is for our shelving unit on here and at the bottom of the shelving unit is a small refrigerator .for actual table a side with tables and chairs we have 2 small area rugs and the colors that are in this room will be green and black .we 're going to put these under the table we have 2 cups , 2 plates , 2 place mats and a chinese lantern that will hubber over the table .
you could practice this from standing position .so start with your fist to your hips .okay , chest straight out , elbows pulled back .okay , now the fist , you want to start by slowly coming out with the form rubbing against the side of the hip and the rib .okay , you want to twist out and then twist the fist over the last second .okay , now with the punch , if you notice his shoulders , after he throws the punch , okay , you want your shoulders almost in a completely straight line and the fist parallel .it 's very important that you rotate the shoulder .if you punch squared like this , okay , this puts unneeded tension right here on top of the shoulder and there 's no power coming in .all the power 's coming from the side , see , and you could be push back easily .very important that you twist all the way out to get the proper extension. [CLS] [SEP]and then you get more power coming from the hips. [CLS] [SEP]cause. [CLS] [SEP]that 's where the power from the punch comes from , the rotation of the hips .okay , if you look at the difference , okay , if i throw a regular punch squared , okay , there 's really not much power , but if i twist a little bit , so you twist in. [CLS] [SEP], you can use your palm for practice , okay , straight back .i get much more reach .so i have this , okay , just like that , and if he stays there , see there 's no reach , but if i twist out ,i that much more distance .so you want to come straight out. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to twist at the last section , the last second to perform like an exploding action with the hand .so straight out and then twist .okay .and that is the proper way to perform a straight punch .
now , she is just going to rest there for just a moment .she can take her hands down while i bring the pillow for just in case .it 's always good to have a pillow as a safety measure in case you fall backwards .and she is going to bring her hands behind her ankles .good , and press her palms in to ground .good .she 's then going to use her core to lift her body up and bring her legs out to the side .good .she 's pressing her inner thighs onto her upper arms and her upper arms into her inner thighs .good. [CLS] [SEP]and then shes going to bring it back in and lower all the way down .lengthen through her spine and end in anjali mudra .and thats the firefly pose .
when is our painting finished ?when it captures the mood that you are trying to capture .the level of detail you put in is irrelevant .we can work this for another ten , twelve hours and put in every little spot and every little detail , or we can stop now .or , we could 've stopped an hour ago , or two hours ago .make no difference , it 's entirely subjective .the art is n't the important thing , the important thing is the process .art is n't about creating pictures , it 's about training your eye how to see .if you train your eye how to see things like shadows and light , when you look at the world , you 'll see so much more than you can possibly imagine if you do n't go through the process of practicing visualization .leanardo devinci was n't a great artist because he wanted to be an artist , he was a great artist because he was a scientist trying to study nature , and the way he studied nature was by observing .and the process of drawing and painting forced him to see things the way nobody had ever seen things before .this a nice bi-product of the process , but what it 's all about is really learning how to use your eyes in ways that you ca n't learn how to use your eyes in any other way .the process is more important than the painting .it 's nice to have a painting , but it 's even nicer to be able to see things that nobody else can see when you look at a still life .enjoy the process .
okay .so we 're nearly done with this one .i check out our outline and see if we need to make any more shadows to make sure that 's nothing 's blending too much into the background here .we could start to work on the background a little bit .we do need to work some issues with the outline shadows particularly on this ear .and we can also define it by putting alignment at the background .that 's better , and so i really like it .okay .let 's see .it 's about riving in as you go and work on the background and filling the background more , there 'll be more definition in this outline and the face will come out a little bit more .
as your dog becomes older , becomes geriatric , they might not be as comfortable having some of the maintenance done on them .your care , nail care , coat care .it 's very important that you maintain a routine with these guys .you might need to get a softer more gentle brush .certainly , the hair is going to be growing and shedding .sometimes they actually start shedding a little bit more , so you just want to do a gentles , soft ... [CLS] [SEP]good girl , good girl ...routine that you work with the dog .it will certainly keep the coat cleaner and as you 're doing this , you have a chance to go over the dog and make sure that there 's no growths that you had n't spotted or if the dog had some growths that they 're not getting large quickly .because if that 's the case , you would certainly want to bring them into the vet .this girl actually had just 7 months ago quite major surgery .she had 2 very large growths on her .one over here and one over here .as it turns out , she had osteosarcoma in her mammary glands , so she had major surgery .she 's doing very , very well .it 's important especially with a situation like that , that you go over your dog regularly .by regular brushing you can notice if there 's any new skin tabs that have come up or if there 's a new tumor or lump coming up .you can keep an eye on it and see how fast it 's growing .you 're also removing the dead hair .as you can see , i 'm getting a lot of hair out her .i 'm removing the dead hair from her .it 's going to make her more comfortable , more clean in the house , and just give her a general overall more healthy coat .again , a geriatric dog might be a less comfortable .they might not have the tolerance of lying down for as long .you might need to change the kind of brush you are using .maybe you want to get a softer brush .this in fact is a brush for humans , but it works quite nicely on this dog .of course , this is a short-coated dog .she does shed a lot so keeping that coat coming out is going to be important .
what we 're going to do is a criss cross through the ladder and we 're going to do ali 's , an ali shuffle with the hands .now what this means is remember , when you workout we got three plays of motion .we 're working in a transverse playing motion here , so you in out , in out , in out , in out , in out , in out , dropping it down here bringing the hand into the circle , back into the circle , back ... [CLS] [SEP]keeping the chest up core height and that is how to kick your butt in two minutes .
well everybody knows that the camera is the most important tool for a photographer .not everybody knows that the tripod comes in at a close second .it 's very important when you 're a photographer to always have the tripod with you .you never know if you 're going to need it for a low light situation .you never know if you 're going to need it to have the camera in the exact same position every time you 're taking a photo .and you never know if you 're going to need it just to allow yourself to step away from the camera for little bit as well .tripods , like i said , i really ca n't say enough about them .if you do n't have one , you need to go out and get one , and just make sure you always have it with you because you 'll never know when you need it and a lot of photographers can look at an image and tell if it was shot with a tripod or not .because typically an image shot with a tripod is going to have a much crisper look to it and everything is going to be sharp and in focus , and when you 're taking photographs , that 's what you want .you want things to be as crisp as possible , as sharp as possible and as in focus as possible .
if you 're going to learn how to skateboard the first thing you 're going to need to learn is how to push .the easiest way to figure that out is to have a friend stand behind you and push you forward. [CLS] [SEP]whichever foot you step forward with is going to be your front foot .i usually step forward with my right foot meaning that i would ride goofy .which is with your left foot in the back , right foot in the front .but some people may ride regular which is right foot in the back , left foot in the front .and the important thing to keep in mind when you push is to aim your foot in the direction that you want to go .and it 's pretty much just a kicking motion against the ground , controlling it from that point on .and like i said , this is pretty much the basic foundation of everything in skateboarding .you 're going to need speed to perform the tricks that i 'm going to be teaching you in the rest of the series .so just keep in mind to aim your front foot forward or wherever you want to go because where you aim your foot is the direction that the board is going to send you .
let 's talk about to talk about how to stop your dog from chasing their tail .one of the first things you need to do is try to determine why is your dog chasing his or her tail .is it because they 're bored , they 're overly hyperactive or it 's an enjoyable activity ?it is something you can put on cue for your dog if they seem to enjoy. [CLS] [SEP]and then if they do it off cue , in other words you have n't asked them to chase their tail or spin in a circle. [CLS] [SEP], then you would n't reward it. [CLS] [SEP]and hopefully that behavior will diminish .a couple of the things to take care of right off the bat are look at your dog 's diet , is your dog 's diet high in something like grains that could be causing hyperactivity to which they may be allergic .you might want to work with somebody who is very interested in nutrition for example , a small boutique pet food distributor in your area or your veterinarian .that would be the first step .the other question is is your dog getting enough mental and physical exercise ?lady here came to me at four years old as a rescue , she was n't getting enough physical exercise nor was she getting enough mental stimulation .she was also twenty pounds overweight .so we got her weight down , we gave her plenty to do and to think about , and that behavior diminished .every now and then , she 'll get a little excited and she 'll chase her tail. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's nothing like it used to be .if you try all of these things and your dog is still chasing his or her tail , then you might want to - you probably need to go and talk to a veterinarian , you might need to look at an obsessive compulsive disorder .but that would be a very rare thing .and there are medications on the market for that .but again , you can try to deal with it a little bit on your own and then outside of that certainly consult a professional .
now the derailer hanger is the small tab of metal that your derailer mounts into .typically when you crash or your bike gets dropped the hanger acutally bends and not the derailer .so , to remedy the situation , you actually need to remove the derailer and straighten out that tab , and align it back in line with the drive train .to do that you will use a five millimeter allen wrench on the center of this bolt here on the derailer , and just going to remove that .you can do that with the chain attached .typically easier if you shift it into the smallest cog first .so once you 've dropped the derailer down , you can clearly see the derailer hanger , and this is a special tool that is used for straightening the derailer hangers , it 's just called a derailer hanger alignment gage .this threads into the derailer hanger and uses the rear wheel as the gage for being in line .so for this you just thread this in , and then you use this metal rod as a guide , and you just push this up against the braking surface of the rim , set it down , and check it directly across at ninety , make sure that that should fall directly against the rim as well .here it 's a little inside , so you just bend it a little .reset it , and check it .then you also do it for ,yeah .basically check this all the way around .it should maintain the same distance to the rim all the way around .once you have gotten that straight , you then remove this , re-install the derailer .that 's how to straighten a derailer hanger .
hi my name is geoff sterling. [CLS] [SEP]and i am going to be showing you right now the reinforced block which means that you are going to use both of your arms to snap and lock .this is a more powerful heavier type of block .it may be a little slower and you are sacrificing speed. [CLS] [SEP]but you will gain power .you are going to do it this way and close your body because this is a defensive hip .both your arms are going to hang down together now and think of it like you are drawing a pistol , drawing it this way and blocking with both of your hands .a way to look at it is with soo bahk do with the punches you strike with these two knuckles here .the way to look at it is it is more of an impact on the surface area .it is easy to think of things like these two knuckles and not all four .you have a kind of a notch right there in your bone. [CLS] [SEP]and basically it is a perfect crevice for these two knuckles to go. [CLS] [SEP]and so it is kind of like the place it lands when you hit he block .it lands right there .right there .that was reinforced double block .from hollywood soo bahk do , thank you for watching .
hello .my name is gabriela garzon at g.g .image and etiquette consulting in miami , florida .in this clip , i 'm going to talk about women 's fall wardrobe .so basically this is like the cold time of the year , so of course you 're going to wear like usual , the darker colors , the burgundies , the navies , trench coats , or just like really. [CLS] [SEP], of course , it depends on how your winter is .this is how , how you should just go ahead and pair it with like different types of pants like tweed type of skirts .use lots of boots .high boots , low boots .use different types of sweaters for layering .this is the time where you 're going to start layering like crazy .this is a nice navy type of color .use pants that are like kind of like the tweed type of pattern or pleat , and also use like lots of like different jackets that have like hoodies or just wear like sweaters with the hoodies , and then the jackets and the trench coats .and of course , just go ahead and have lots of fun at buying different type of boots because that 's the type of accessory that you want to have fun with your clothing .once again , this is gabbie at g.g .image and etiquette consulting .
my best wood that i prefer if i had one wood to choose out of all the trees would be the sycamore .sycamore grows anywhere , almost anywhere in america .where there is water , there is usually wood .even here in the desert , where there is dry wooded bed , all around lake montezuma , here in cottonwood , cornville , there is plenty of sycamore , dried creek beds .you will find limbs and stuff like cottonwood is a good wood .especially in the inner side , inside the bark , not the roots , the native americans , the hoppies use to roots .but the inside is a nice firm wood .so this is in between hard and soft .what i am going to do is split this down the middle. [CLS] [SEP]and then it will give me two masks .i really do n't want a mask in here because it is curved that way .but i would n't mind two masks here , coming off the side .so what we are going to do , we are going to get two for one .so i got some safety glasses on and we are ready to go .so i got a nice good grip in between my feet .
ok , in this segment what we 'll take a look at is the major components of the lathe .what makes the lathe go is the head stock .the head stock on this machine is driven by belts .if you can look inside , you 'll see that there 's several different levels of belts , as you change the combinations between the motor and the head stock. [CLS] [SEP]you 'll get a set of different speeds .with this larger lathe , everything is done electronically .by the twist of the dial , i can adjust the speed faster or slower as it goes along .this lathe also has what 's called an electronic brake , which when you shut it off , will get the lathe to stop quicker .what holds the work , especially spindle work on the lathe is your tail stock .in here , you 'll have a center that , you 'll have a drive center in the head stock , and a tail center back here , and the work will be held in between .the tail stock also has a feature where as you spin the dial , you 'll have what 's called a quill on the inside , which will allow you to advance the tail stock forward and back .you have a part of the lathe called the banjo .this is what holds the tool rest .this is where you work with it holding onto the tools .this will give you just a quick idea of the different components that you want with the lathe .one last item to take a look at is the positioning of your switch .your switches need to be relatively in an easy area to get a hold of in case you need to stop the lathe .
i 'll take my lunch bag and go ahead and pack that in this big bag .another thing that you definitely want to have at work at all times is your planner .you make your schedule at work. [CLS] [SEP]and you know when you 're going to come back .i take my planner all the time. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'll know when i 'm coming back to work and what needs to be done .i 'll go ahead and pack my planner .i need nursing supplies .whatever you like is up to you .you may want a pencil case .i use this cute little case that i got from the 99 cent store .i keep pens , highlighters , things that i might need at work while i 'm charting or documenting .i pack this little case .i also might put my medical scissors in also .i 'll go ahead and pack that .you know hand washing is the number one thing to prevent infection in the hospital .i also take hand sanitizer with me also just in between if i 'm eating or just if i ca n't get to wash my hands .i also want to pack my thermos just in case i want to make tea , hot chocolate , or have a hot cup of coffee throughout the night .you can put this in your bag , but you might want to save this on your way to work in case you 're drinking something on your way .stethoscope ; always need it .ca n't live without it .ca n't work without it .make sure it 's in your bag .there 's blood pressure cuffs at work .i take mine because i just like to keep it with me .you never know if you may need it to check on yourself .i just like to keep all my supplies with me .that 's pretty much all that i have in this bag .what you put in yours is up to you , but make sure you have the necessities .
it 's in the melrose shopping district called melrose hair studio .today we 're going to go ahead and show you how to blow dry your hair properly .we 're going to blow dry it straight .this is my client grace .hi !we 're going to spend these next few minutes showing you how to blow dry your hair with the right products , the right brushes , the right blow dryer , and we 're going to get your hair straight , volume , and all the other stuff that everybody always asks me how do you do this at home what you do in the salon .
ok , let 's try counting some half notes now while we 're playing with the long bows .back to the french bow .a half note goes for two beats .one , two , three , four .just like that so let 's keep about that tempo and play some half notes together for two beats each .one , two , ready , begin .one , two , three , four .one , two , three , four .again , one , two .one half upper string .one , two , three , four .one , two , three , four .one , two , three , four .one , two , three , four .now we can play in three-four time .we 'll dotted half note which goes for three beats .one , ready , begin .one , two , three .one , two , three .one , two , three .one , two , three and back down .review this lesson for counting half notes and dotted half notes .
alright now that you know the minor chords we are going to go to the dominic chord which is also known as the 7th chord .it starts on the 5th degree of c. [CLS] [SEP]so we got 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5 , g .so now g is our root , so there is a void note for g which is ironically the root of the major scale c which is the 4th .so when you are doing voicing you want to avoid that c. [CLS] [SEP]so now i 'm going to show you some voicing for g7 .notice how i avoid the c. [CLS] [SEP]but you can get a cool sound if you want to do a d sus as you play the c. [CLS] [SEP]but it changes the note value to a sustain chord .see how i 'm still playing g. [CLS] [SEP]it goes back and forth. [CLS] [SEP]and if you add in the minor chord you get what jazz musician call a 2 ,5 where you go from the 2 of the scale to the 5th .and you hear how that wants to go back to the one major .
in this clip , we 're going to talk about the proper service procedure for removing and replacing a front strut on a front-wheel drive vehicle .in this step , we 're going to talk about the proper service procedure for aligning our upper mount and remounting it .as you can see , there is a little nipple here .that nipple is going to point out , away from the vehicle , straight to the tire .we 're going to want to line that up with the center of our strut mount portion that goes to the spindle .just like so .once you have these aligned , you 're ready to mount the upper portion .now on the body of the vehicle , there will be a corrosion mark which will indicate where this part goes .as you can see , we have a corrosion mark from where our upper mount seats to the body of the vehicle .and what we 're looking for is an indicator tab .that will let us know the proper alignment for installing our new strut .as you can see , there is a little dimple right here .that 's what we 're looking for .there will be a corresponding dimple on the mount .we 're going to want to make sure to line those two up when we install it on the vehicle .i 'm going to go ahead and slip it up inside the vehicle and starts with my nuts on the top .just like so .i 'm going to take and hold onto a coil and grab one of my nuts and get it started on there .alright , i 'm going to go ahead and tighten them down .we 'll use a x pattern for torquing this down .they do n't have to be extremely tight , you can break them .right there is good .i 'm going to jump all the way across to this one and perform an x pattern .what that will do is ensure that it seats nice and flat to the inside surface of our suspension tower .jump over here .and then diagonally across to complete our x pattern .and there you go .that is the proper service procedure for aligning and remounting your upper strut mount .
we used a regular light .it produces enough heat to dry the nails .you can also use a fan , which will provide a constant air source to dry them .if you do n't dry your nails completely , then you could end up with polish on your clothes .you 're going to smudge the polish and the nail art if you 've put any on , which will then have to be completely removed and done all over again .so you always want to make sure that they are completely dry .if , when you gently touch the tip of them , you do n't want to just smash your finger down on it , but you gently touch it , if it does n't seem dry , it 'll feel a little tacky. [CLS] [SEP], you just want to allow it to dry under the same nail source , or the heat source , or fan , whichever that you used , for another five minutes at least .then your nails should be completely dry .they 'll be tack free when they are .you 're still going to want to be careful when you 're putting them in your pants or anything else. [CLS] [SEP]so you do n't cause an indention into the nail polish .joyce 's nails seem to be completely dry , and that is how you dry your nails , and why you should dry them .
there 's a whole category of large connecticut wall clocks or wall regulators that are rare and expensive. [CLS] [SEP]but they 're wonderful to own .and when you get into the higher levels of collecting you really want to have some fine rare clocks in your collection , depending on how much wall space you have , should be some of these early large connecticut wall clocks .this happens to be a seth thomas number 7.these clocks again are quite rare .i was lucky enough to have one recently .sold it for around $ 14 ,000 .so when they 're in good condition that 's what they bring .they were made by seth thomas but also made by the other large companies we talked about as well .gilbert , waterbury , ingram , all those companies made these big regulators because they were competing with each other .these were rarely used in home settings although mostly collectors now have them in their homes .but you need to keep in mind that back in the 1880 's 1890 's nobody would have had a clock this big just hanging on their living room wall like you may see now in a collectors house .you would have just seen them in post offices , banks , lawyers offices , places where you needed to be able to see the time from far away .as i mentioned they 're desirable , people want them in their collections .you can see this very clock on the cover of a recent auction catalog .it shows again this very model that was sold at this auction as well .so , desirable .we 'll talk about this auction company coming up soon .
so take a look around out there , there are other creative ways of financing and leasing a used car that you may not have known .take a look at your local dealership and ask them if they have any leasing programs for used cars .usually you can find that with mercedes or bmw or lots of high line cars .so remember that there are other options for you .leasing a used car is a great way to find a great car at an affordable price for you. [CLS] [SEP]so do yourself a favor and look into leasing a used car .
i 'm beau timken , master sake sommelier .in this segment we 're speaking about ginjo sake and specifically we 're talking about how do you drink ginjo sake .what do you drink it out of , if you will ?now , again , i have a theory that drinking alcohol is a luxury and drink out of whatever you want to make you happy .if it 's time , place and occasion , tpo , drink out of whatever glassware that people have and you 'll enjoy it all the same .but if you specifically want to test ginjo sake , for a vessel that will really put it through its paces , i would recommend a white wine glass , like a vienne chardonnay glass .where , you know , maybe i 'd do a little bit bigger bowl something very delicate , very soft .ginjo is supposed to represent sort of delicate , light , clean , soft , aromatic qualities .so , a ginjo , you know it 's difficult to drink out of something like this .and in fact , this comes from way back centuries ago when they used to drink sake out of seashells .it 's actually , this kind of glassware is the modern day version of the seashell .but ginjo sake , typically , should be consumed chilled .i would say sort of out of the refrigerator , right up , straight up. [CLS] [SEP]or you can go about ten or fifteen minutes .but on the whole , think of chilled sake when you think of ginjo .and , again , if you want to see the sake go very well probably with food pairings , i would drink out of a bigger bowl .now one thing i would n't drink ginjo sake out of a little ochoko .a lot of people think. [CLS] [SEP]oh do i have to drink my sake out of little cups .that 's just the wrong perception .you 're supposed to drink your hot sake out of little cups .but to drink a beautiful ginjo , you would miss all of the layers of nuances and subtleties just by throwing it .it 's such a small little surface .acidity is the distributor of flavor and feeling .it 's just too choked up by drinking , coincidentally enough , an ochoko .so for ginjo glassware. [CLS] [SEP]i recommend definitely , like vienne chardonnay white wine glass. [CLS] [SEP]or you know something more fluted , this is more of a daiginjo glass .and , if you 're so bold , you may get one of these , which is an ice carafe .you put ice in the pocket and you put your cold sake on the outside and never do the two meet .so then you would pour and enjoy that way .but again , ginjo , think clean , think light and think dry , and very clean , light , dry glass .
what we 'll cover at this point is finishing the outside of the bowl .typically you would like to get a piece of sand paper and fold it into thirds .this gives you a little bit of a padding as you go in .i will be using a 120 grit to start with .as this goes around you will see a number of lines and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm trying to use the sand paper to take those lines out .what you will also do at this point , once you get the lines basically out is to stop and look around to see if there is any rough portions. [CLS] [SEP], i 've got a little bit in there , then i 'll work at standing those out .be sure to get a coarse enough piece with the paper .then with those marks basically out , go back in with a finer grit .as you go through you want to be sure that you eliminate any lines that you have in the work .the lines that you come up with like a lighter line tends to indicate that there is some tear out or some other defect in it that needs to be sanded out .
if you get to the point in a diabolical puzzle where you have potentially three numbers left going in a column and probably three numbers going in a row and they intersect essentially what you do is , you start by selecting one of the numbers and go up with the other potential numbers and go across with the other potential numbers and see if that fits .when it doesn ’ t you back up the same way you put the numbers in , so you end up back at the same square .now you take one of the other potential numbers and go up and go across and see how that fits ,if that doesn ’ t complete that column and that row you back up the same way you put the numbers on. [CLS] [SEP]they shape. [CLS] [SEP]so you end up back at the same square .this time you take the third potential number put in the other potential numbers in the row and the column and by that process up and down , up and down. [CLS] [SEP]you get to the point where you completed the puzzle .
the difference between cranking amps and cold cranking amps is the amount of juice your battery can send to the starter at different temperatures .your battery is going to be rated for two specific things , above 32 degrees and below 32 degrees .cold cranking amps is below 32 degrees .if there 's ice on the road , your cold cranking amps are going to matter .if you suspect your battery is beginning to get weak. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's not quite wintertime yet. [CLS] [SEP], it 's a good idea to head to your local parts store who will test your battery for free .they 'll hook it up to a machine and actually load test the amount of cranking amps the battery has .the battery i have here on my truck is rated for 750 cold cranking amps .this engine , specifically , needs 500 to start .as far as regular cranking amps , this battery is rated for 935.as you can see , it is the decrease in temperature the cranking amps is going to drop off .so like i said , before winter hits , what you 're going to want to do is head to your local parts store , like i said , they 'll do it for free , is have the cranking amperage of your battery tested .and if you happen to live in one of the northern states already and you notice that your vehicle cranks extremely hard or slowly , you may want to go to the parts store and get a heavier duty battery .a heavy duty battery is going to come with more cold cranking amps , which is going to ensure that , at least , the starter is going to get enough juice to revolve the engine to the point that it operates under its own power .if you happen to be moving from a southern state to a northern state , it 's going to be one of the things you want to do right away .in the southern states , they do n't sell a lot of heavy duty cold cranking amp batteries .it 's just not required for people that live in that geographic location .so if you head like from , say florida to michigan , one of the things you 're going to want to do is head to the parts store when you get in town and have your battery actually tested .the five minutes you spend having your battery tested , for free of course , is going to save you a real hard time of your vehicle not starting .
in this clip , i 'm going to show you how to find the right hair color .now , there 's different colors out there , and it depends what you 're looking for .if you want to cover your gray hair and. [CLS] [SEP]you just want your basic color ; you might want a brown or a blond ; just go straight to what your color is naturally. [CLS] [SEP]and you choose the color according to your hair .you can also turn around and get a little bit more spicy and add different dimensions of color in your hair .just depends on what you want to do with the hair color itself , okay ?we have reds and we have other tones that might be , that might suit you fine .maybe something a little gold , okay .and it depends on the upkeep of your hair too .if you want to just constantly keep up with hair color , and you and you do so , and you , you know , have to do your touch-ups often , then you do n't want to go maybe too light where you have to highlight constantly .you 're going to have to be on it , because you can see the dark roots. [CLS] [SEP], okay ?so , just choose something that 's going to make you happy. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's going to go with your lifestyle .this is liz muller , and this is how to choose the right hair color .
it is a common card .it is tribal instant faerie which means it gets benefits for being a faerie and gives anything if you play a faerie spell , get a certain thing , then this card would count towards that .peppersmoke costs you 1 black to play and. [CLS] [SEP]what it does is , is that the target creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn .if you control a faerie , draw a card which means other creature that you choose gets -1/-1. [CLS] [SEP]so its good for taking out a creature that was played first round or a little annoying 1/1 creature that has the ability such as a lorwyn elf or another faerie or anything that is 1/1 such as a raging goblin and if you control the faerie , if you already had a faerie in play , then you get to draw a card which allows you to cycle faster through your cards which allows you get to the cards that will make your deck work and essentially that is a key to playing this card .
the other two vegetables we 're going to be adding here , are mushrooms and zucchini , so we 're also going to slice our mushrooms , as we did our red peppers and onions , and we 're going to take our zucchini , and we 're going to cut off the ends .then , we 're going to do these like we did the carrots , in little disks .all right , now we 're going to prepare our rosemary , so what we can do , is either pick off each leaf individually , like that , or you can grab about three quarters of the way up , and you can tell where it starts to get soft .that 's where you want to grab , and then you can just pull down , and all of the little leaves will come off .then , you can go ahead , and pick the leaves off the top , avoiding the stem .mince and turn , and. [CLS] [SEP]we 'll cut it until there are no large hearts of the leaf left .
side crunch side laying on the ball with the elbow out .if this is the first clip that you happened to find , i would highly recommend that you check the previous clips on this series to learn how to get into the position , or even further back to learn how to do the exercise kneeling with ball support .cause this is a progression and you happen to stumble upon something that 's a little more challenging , a little more advanced .however , i 'm going to show you how to do it .what you want to do is wedge the ball , okay ,your outside leg with the foot support and. [CLS] [SEP]you 're going to push into it .hand down on the floor , if you ca n't reach that means the ball is too big for you .now , a lot of times that tends to happen is as shoulder wants to come forward , if you do any of that , the ball is going to roll from under you .so the challenge is to keep these shoulders stacked .you 're going to push with that foot until you can mount the ball with your hips .that down leg , that under leg is going to stay straight .you can go into this position , this is the easiest of the three positions , believe it or not , you 're thinking easier , of the three it is .stack , stagger feet or stacked .and either way you 're all stacked up right here .the head is going to continue , the line of the spine .there 's going to be a tendency to want to do this , that 's not good for the neck .so , for the elbow out , you 're going to place your fingertips on your temple .not on this cause you 're going to be pulling on your head .you keep the chest open , everything is facing forward .take an inhale and as you exhale , you crunch .so now i 'm supporting with the hands , but. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm not pushing with the hand .it 's a very different move .this is supporting me , but i 'm really doing the move from here , crunching right here .inhale , exhale , inhale , exhale .do a feel , make sure you keep alignment .if i am , somebody 's looking at me from above , they should see my elbow on top of my shoulders .so they should n't be elbow and shoulder separate .keep the hips stacked , move into a more challenging position when you 're ready .and before you know it , you 'll have the best looking core in town .see you soon .
and that means something. [CLS] [SEP], it 's kind of a non sense saying , but ras geesumadara. [CLS] [SEP], geesuma means , i do n't see or i ca n't see , and dara just means nothing .so basically the rhythm is called ras. [CLS] [SEP], i ca n't see anything , i see nothing .and you 're usually doing a waiting move while you do that step .so for example , we can go side to side with that , the drum rhythm will be playing , and we 're just singing , ras geesumadara , gin , gee-gee , ja-ja gin , side to side , until the drumming proper begins .
alright let 's play the bass drum on beat one , the and of one , the and of three , and the and of four .alright to practice this. [CLS] [SEP]i like to separate it into two ideas in terms of the bass figure .on one hand we have the bass drum surrounding the beat of one as in playing on beat one , directly before beat one which is the and of four , and directly after beat one , the and of one .sounds like this .and the other part of this equation is to play the bass drum on the and of three .which is directly after the back beat where we play the snare on beat three as well as the hi hat .put it all together and what do we get ?
it is an uncommon , and once again , it will cost you forty ; fifty cents at your local gaming store .it is an artifact ; phyrexian vault costs 3 to play , is 3 colorless , and it 's a very powerful card , because it gives you an option that most artifacts wo n't give you .but it 's 2 and a tap , sacrifice a creature , draw a card .now the reason you would play this is a , you get to draw a card ; b , is because you get to sack a creature .now some people do n't like to sacrifice creatures ; however , people who play black and red know that a lot of creatures have ; when they go into the graveyard from play , they have abilities , like they do damage , or they deal loss life , or a creature gets minus something , minus something until end of turn .so , you need a way to sack the creature .well , this artifact right here , which is cheap , gives you a way to not only sack the creature , and yield those benefits , but it also allows you to draw a card .this makes this card very powerful , especially in blue/black control domination decks .
i can even add a little bit more .i 'm doing the inside stroke .exaggerated serifs. [CLS] [SEP]and i do the outside stroke .see now , i 'm doing this in just black because i 'm being simple about this. [CLS] [SEP]but this could be a beautiful color , easily , or many colors .i 'll do one more .do the inside and the outside and join .let me just do one more still because here 's what called the rounded e. [CLS] [SEP]influenced by the unchel hand which we will deal with .watching the counter , slightly above center .so , there you go .this is versals .there 's a million variations on this theme , you can make up your own. [CLS] [SEP]just understand what the purpose of the versal is .it 's to draw your eye to the write place to begin reading , that 's the basic idea .clean the brush , clean the brush .
another category of english clocks is really a hybrid .they 're called anglo-american clocks .the cases , all the decorative part you can see here , were made in england , but the movements were , were inexpensive american , connecticut , movements that were imported to put in these cases .as a lot of the cost of english clocks was in the old fashioned , high quality method of making the movements .so if they could get an inexpensive movement , and put it in an attractive case , that was something they could do and sell a less expensive , less expensive clock in england .these were typically quite ornate .you can see in this case , we have inlayed silver or mother of pearl in the case .they often have this kind of school clock design , as you see , but they come in other designs as well .inside is probably a movement made by new haven or one of the connecticut companies , it would , in this case , it 's just a timepiece , you see , but often they were time and strike as well , and at least some of the history suggests that these cases made in england were made by very skilled italian craftsmen who were coming to england in order to better themselves , to find better paying jobs .so they were very skilled and they were available for work at a reasonable wage .so a lot of these anglo-american clocks were made by very skilled craftspeople of the time .
and then the power ball will come out of the orange one .and now we 've trapped our power ball or we will have trapped it , in an infinite loop .you can see that it 's just coming out of the orange portal and going into the blue one .but what we can do now is , since we know where the receptacle is. [CLS] [SEP]and since we know where the ball is , we 'll be able to deliver the ball to the receptacle if we wait for it to go into the orange and shoot a second blue portal over here .so we 'll wait for it to come through again .did n't quite get the distance right , but that 'll bounce through the orange , out of the blue , and should go right into our power receptacle .great , it did .
michelle and them have great broadheads .so it 's just a personal preference ,whatever you feel the most comfortable with , that 's what you need to get .there 's two types of broadheads , we have expandable broadheads which are like these here , and on impact they open up. [CLS] [SEP]and they cut a bigger whole .then you have the fixed broadhead which is like the slick trick and the muzzy 's and the razorcaps , all of these are fixed broadheads .so any of this is a great product to have .this is the little stabilizer i was showing you that was on my bow .i love these little stabilizers , its compact .it 's really not even needed on my bow. [CLS] [SEP], i guess it 's more of a habit than anything , but i like having it on there .then the next thing that you make sure you get a very good high quality rest. [CLS] [SEP]and you 'll be very pleased that you did that .spend the money to get a good rest , do n't put a cheap rest on there , and , again , it improves your accuracy .a lot of things like this , you 'll find out when you go into stores , so enjoy that .and first of all , archerers are gadget people , and we love to go in to see all the new stuff out , so go into every pro shop you can and just see all the new stuff that 's out there .but anyway , good luck and god bless , and enjoy a lifetime of archery .
hi , i 'm art malov from your dating coach in new york city , and i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]the author of `` park bench dating '' .in this clip we 're going to talk about how to be a good flirt , and jess here will give me a hand .and the flirting is actually quite simple .what most guys are afraid of is say something and look stupid , and that 's why they do n't do enough flirting .so when you flirt , it 's ok to , you know , to be playful .it 's really , it 's just a , you know , joking around and going back and forth , and you know , you can say anything of ,oh , those shoes are , are great .it 's pirates of the caribbean .and you see. [CLS] [SEP], it 's nice and playful , and everybody love pirates , so you ca n't go wrong with that .it does n't even have to make sense , it 's just playful , fun , and she will respond , with a smile , with a smile , or say something .it really , but the thing is , do n't take it too seriously , once again , just have fun , enjoy .this has been our art malov , and it has been how to be a good flirt .
do n't come into the office and say , ``oh i need a phone , can i borrow your phone . [CLS] [SEP]''one day i was conducting an audition and an actor was holding a receiver of a telephone as if he was on the telephone. [CLS] [SEP]and i looked at him. [CLS] [SEP]and i said , `` where did you get that receiver ? ''before he got a chance to answer. [CLS] [SEP]i said , `` that 's my fax machine , is n't it '' and it was .what he has done is he had disabled my fax machine by removing the receiver and my fax machine was ringing busy while he had the receiver. [CLS] [SEP]and he was using it for his audition .so make sure whenever you 're going to use a prop , you bring your own props .
all right , we 're going to start off , by making the marinade for our chicken , so we 're going to grab two cloves of garlic .then , we 're going to look on either end , for the little brown parts , and once we find them , go ahead and cut them off , and discard them , because they 're about the size , of what we want our garlic to be .all right , we 're going to mince these down , and then we 're going to add them right here , into our bowl .we 're going to measure a half a tablespoon of curry powder , and of cumin .we 're going to cut a lime in half , and we 're going to squeeze the juice , right over , and then we 're going to add the same , about a half tablespoon of honey .then , we 're going to stir this all up together , until it makes sort of a paste .
and you use your legs to stop the person from closing in when they kick , but if you want to use your hands , it 's called `` kwan sau . [CLS] [SEP]''the left hand here is in low gaan sau , this is high gaan sau .so if i do it on the left side , it looks like this ; if i rotate it to the right side , it looks like this .so in other words , if he 's throwing a hook kick towards my head , i shift out of the way. [CLS] [SEP]and i block with kwan sau .as i shift out of the way , i can also attack him with a kick the same time that i shift .so he goes to attack. [CLS] [SEP], i shift , i go in , and now i continue my attack .what 's better is when he goes to do the kick , if i step in , i throw him off balance .that 's more effective than blocking , but these are some just hand techniques to understand .if you have to use a hand technique and the kick is already heading to you and you have no choice , then you can deflect with kwan sau .that 's how you use hand techniques from wing chun to block kicks .
i talked about dribbling using the shoe laces , outside of the foot and the inside of the foot .now what i want to talk about is the technique that i call a roll over .basically what you 're doing is you 're using the bottom of your shoes ( soles of shoes ) and you 're just rolling over the ball .you 're not touching it hard , you 're not hitting it in the middle. [CLS] [SEP]you are just rolling it over .this is very good if your trying to control the ball in a little space. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're not trying to roll around. [CLS] [SEP]cause you can just pivot and turn the ball .it teaches you to touch the ball every other time the more touches you can get on the ball when striding , the stride the better the more control you have .all these drills when you practice doing it backwards , roll it forwards , side to side with left foot. [CLS] [SEP]then you can put them all together and you can go in a circle .in the game you 'll find that this will get you out of really tight spaces and open you up to a space that you can start to push forward in .
training your dog to pick up a toy is very much fun .what you want to do is get your dog very interested in the toy. [CLS] [SEP]and then you want to be prepared to tell your dog that picking up the toy is what you want them to do .so if you work , she 's pulling rather hard , `` drop it '' , `` good '' .if you have a working relationship with a clicker. [CLS] [SEP]it 's a very fast and easy way to teach them to pick the toy up .initially you would get them interested in the toy , make sure they see it , you would drop it on the ground , and click touching it .in lady 's case lady is very use to this activity. [CLS] [SEP]so she 's jumping right to picking the toy up , which then is what we 're going to reinforce .`` good girl '' .as you work you can even get to the point where you can name individual toys and have your dog go find them or pick them up for you .this is a great activity for you to do. [CLS] [SEP]that helps your dog work their mind .
we 're going to take our twist and accent it back and use it to turn around in a circle .so keep your right foot forward , left foot back and accent ’ s on the back .downbeat 's on the back , not the front .back and forward , back , so this is a single twist .back and forward , back and forward .good .now start to turn , accent that backward action .back , make sure you 're not letting your butt stick out , okay .keep the belly button pulled in .keep it a twist , do n't let the hips come up or down .twist straight back and forward , back and forward , back and forward .let 's try it on releve .back , forward , little faster .back , back , back , we can switch the arms out .back , as long as we 're not waving around .back , back , back .left side , left foot forward , right foot back .back and forward , back and forward , so that left hip 's coming back and forward , back and forward , back and forward , back and forward .double time .back , up on releve , keep that weight on the balls of your feet , do n't let your butt stick out , keep your body position nice and clear , good .make sure you practice in front of a mirror , you can get the body position correct on this one .
but if you do want to bring one for a backup , make sure you always get permission from the person to not have it hidden , you know or something like that .so the first thing is gathering your facts .so you are going to have to know what you are going to write a feature story on or what are you going to do a new story on. [CLS] [SEP]and then you do some research maybe on the internet about that .then you are going to write your questions up prior to .when you get to your interview , make sure you are there on time .try to be there 10 minutes early .feel at ease and interview your subject and write everything down .the best time to write your newspaper is immediately after while everything is fresh on your mind .
i 'm a professional stand up comedian .why did i become a comedian ?well for me , the reason i became a comic is i had to become a comedian , because as a youngster i was very shy , introverted , very insecure , had a very low self esteem. [CLS] [SEP]and i did not enjoy that .i hated being like that .so i would see stand up comedians performing on tv. [CLS] [SEP]and i thought ,wow look at the praise they get , look at the , how the audience loves them .the ability to stand out in front of that audience and just take control .i wanted to be like that , so the seed was planted from the time i was a youngster .oh sure , as i grew up i applied for jobs as a fireman , i was rejected .i , i had a lot of other job , and i got a job as a government investigator , and some people go ,wow. [CLS] [SEP]that 's a great job , but to me it was just another stepping stone to the point where i could make some money and then go on to my real journey .which was to become a professional stand up comic .the path i took to become a stand up comic was , i quit a very good government job. [CLS] [SEP]and i moved to los angeles and. [CLS] [SEP]i became a struggling person , a struggling stand up comic .i was going to open mics , three different open mics a night .three different audition performances every night , all across los angeles for a year before i got my first paid gig out here in los angeles .but it took my three or four years before i could actually start making decent money .i 've had several agents over the years , i realized i did n't really need an agent to become a successful comedian , what i needed was to have a strong act. [CLS] [SEP]and then i got in touch with booking agents .there are booking agents all around the country and i developed relationships with them. [CLS] [SEP]and they would call me all the time wanting me to come to their area of the country to work .the way to get a booking agent is to send them a tape of your act .how do you get a tape of your act ?you have someone tape you in a club , or you buy a video camera and tape yourself .it 'll never be high , high quality bu. [CLS] [SEP]it should be good enough that that booking agent can watch that tape and say , `` yep , that person 's funny .that 's the kind of person i want to hire '' .
hi , have you ever wondered about the history of a massage chair .well , i 'm going to tell you a little bit today .i 'm sundae , with natural sundae .now , the first massage chair was invented in 1986.it weighed thirty-six pounds , and came in a wooden box that quickly expanded into a massage chair .now , this was a little bit heavy .thirty-six pounds is n't that much , but if you 're lugging it from location to location and it can be quite tiring .so , it took about ten years , but ten years later , in 1996 , a new version of a massage chair was built out of metal which made it much lighter for the therapist to carry around , and much more comfortable for the client to sit in ; specifically because it contained more padding in the head rest and in the chest guard , which is what my client is sitting in right now .it helps pad the chest , and for ladies this is very important .and then , also you see this chair down here , the seat .so , padding was very , very important and this was embellished a little bit more when the chair was reinvented .so , it took a little while , but the massage chair now enjoys many different kinds and varieties , and there are hundreds of different table , table and chair manufacturers out there , so it 's important to pick the one that you like .there are different colors , and and different sizes , and there 's a very large variety out there .so , good luck pickin ' your chair , and i 'm sundae , with natural sundae. [CLS] [SEP]
in this clip , we 're going to go over the strike zone .the first thing you got to do , get behind the plate , call a play in , play ball .now it 's your job get in position right straight over the catcher 's head .so you can see both sides of the plate without moving .you got a nice peripheral vision of home plate there .now , stay in position you make your call .in little league , it 's right below the letters right there .that 's a good call and then down to the knees .now in little league , some guys they throw the ball on an arc .so its a little more difficult to call a strike when you have an arc because its where it crosses the plate , not where it ends up in the mitt .where it crosses the plate .now , this is called a paint .you can throw over the corners , that 's the paint .that 's a good pitch if you throw over the paint .a good pitcher always hits the paint every pitch , paint , paint , paint .so , throw them hard , throw them fast , throw them straight .over the plate get a strike , got them out .
today i am going to show you on how to make a collage for toddlers .the first thing that you should do is gather different materials. [CLS] [SEP]and you can use a smaller piece of construction paper or a bigger piece .for the toddlers , you probably want a bigger piece. [CLS] [SEP]so they have more room to work on .the materials that i have gathered to make the collage is a bottle of glue , these are just bone shapes , there is heart , circles and squares , just small pieces of yarn , different colored crayons , some colored doodles , scrap pieces of construction paper , shriveled up like shredded paper , pom-poms and some feathers .the first thing you would want to do after you have gathered the materials and the paper is just sit down with your child or a toddler that you are with and make sure it is like a hard surface that they can work on and then just help them with the glue to open it and just let them grab materials and show them how to glue it .my final collage looked like this .hope you enjoy creating a collage with your toddler .
next thing we 're going to talk about. [CLS] [SEP]is how to put together a hermit crab cage .and in order to do that , of course the general rule of thumb for hermit crabs is one crab per gallon of cage .so if you have a ten gallon aquarium , you can put ten hermit crabs in there .today we 're going to be using this little , they call them critter keepers .they 're kind of like a tupperware kind of thing .i like to use these for hermit crabs .they 're small , they hold humidity very well , and they 're not very expensive .so what you want to do is you 're going to take that. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to fill it with a pretty decent amount of bedding as you see here .we 've got coco bedding in there .and then you 're going to take a water bowl. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to add a water bowl to it .okay , and then you 're going to take some sort of , something to add to the enclosure , something for them to climb on .i like to use cork bark .it looks nice and it 's virtually indestructible as far as bacteria and things go .so add a little bit of that to it .i like to make little like cave things that go over the water .i just think it 's kind of neat .and then of course , the last thing you 're going to need is a food bowl .just put that anywhere you can .make sure it 's easily accessible for the hermit crabs as well as the water bowl should be relatively easily accessible and easy to get out of as well .and bingo bango ,you 've got yourself a hermit crab cage .
there are several brands .i 'm not saying that these are the best or the worst or the most expensive or the least .there are so many different prices and so many different kinds .if you can find them at someone 's yard sale , go ahead and get them .it 's worth just trying them to see if you like them .they 're very unusual .they 're like a crayon .they can be blended just like oil ; they 're oil based .you probably ca n't see too much going on yet with that , but you will in a second i think if i can get the right colors for this .now see with a crayon , there would be all bumpy and spaces in between , but this one is not .it 's actually blending just like oil .it 's getting a lot softer and you can go out the edges blending .if you were making a picture with this , you could use it for highlights , you could use it for shadowing .that 's a very poor , small example of this .we 'll keep doing this here for a second to maybe show you a piece of sky or some clouds poking thru .i have used my finger and. [CLS] [SEP]i have also purchased nibs that are specifially made for blending these and they 're twists of paper with a heart and some are round , some are pointed .depending on what you 're using them for , you would get the different shapes .i 'm just going to try and do this quickly here. [CLS] [SEP]where i 'm blending some of these colors together to soften them .you can use a lot of that .you can make it as thick as you want .for blending , sometimes the thicker , the better .alright .if you 'll come back to our next segment , you 'll see us blending .i think i 'll try and do a flower where you 'll actually see the blending work out .
the easiest way to get your stencil onto the vinyl is to cut a piece of vinyl that is about the size of where you want to put it .you 're going to put your piece of paper that has your pattern on it , you can put it on the vinyl , or the vinyl on it , and then you 're going to put another piece of vinyl on the back .so you 're making a vinyl sandwich with your stencil .so this is the one piece of vinyl on the top ,my piece of paper that has my graphic is underneath the top piece of vinyl , then there 's another piece of vinyl on the back , and we take the paper off of the vinyl on the back , and then this one 's going to go on this plate .so , we will just place it in the middle of a plate and cut off , smooth it .now if you get edges , like on here , we have some of these edges sticking up , you can just cut them off or fold them over .sometimes you might have a little bit of edging here that sticks out , we 're going to cut that off and just trim it up to make it easier to work with. [CLS] [SEP]is all we 're going to do .
malt is usually going to come in two different forms .you have your malt extracts , you can get a dry version which is a little more concentrated than the liquid versions but a little more expensive .or , you can get the liquid extract which is like a very , very thick syrup .the other form of malts that you are going to be adding to really kind of flesh out the character of the beer that you are making are specialty grains .these are grains that have been roasted somewhat differently , maybe steeped for a little while .and basically they are going to add some of your more complex flavors .when you get your specialty grains , your local home brewing store will help you mill them like this .this will open up the grain allowing extraction of the sugar and the color .next we have hops .and there are two major forms of hops that are available .there is whole hops , which you can see right here .this is actually just the cone of the hop .and then there is also pellet hops which is basically. [CLS] [SEP]all of your whole hops crushed up and then put into a condensed form .the differences between the two : whole hops tend to have a shorter shelf life where pellet hops will last longer .you will also get a slightly better extraction out of pellet hops than you will out of whole hops .however , for today 's purposes in our brewing session , we are going to be using whole hops because they are a little easier to get out of the wort .hops can add three things to your beer .first , they can add bitterness , then they can also add flavor and finally , they can add aroma .hops , which are added early into the boil for around a sixty minute time frame will add primarily bitterness as the flavor and aroma components are boiled off .hops that are added in at a twenty to ten minute time frame will add flavor .they also add a little bitterness , but mainly flavor .and finally , the aroma hops which are added usually in the ten and under time frame down to actually just steeping will add mainly aroma characteristics .
we are going to have emily here coming into some nice leg extensions to kind of finish off her practice today .she is laying on her side , hands together in pray , neck is comfortable .yes !perfect and it kind of using the hip open and then take it to the next level .so we are working with the breath very slowly .inhale , lift the knee , open up that hip .excellent !extend the leg all the way up pressed to that heel .inhale bend the knee .exhale and release all the way back down to the knee .doing it again inhale , open up the hip .exhale , extend the leg .perfect !inhaling bend the knee , exhale release back and bend the knee closing that hip up .one last time inhale , open up the hip , lift the knee .exhale extend. [CLS] [SEP]that leg straight out pressing through the heel .lovely .inhaling bend the knee .exhale knees down bend the the knee making sure that you do both sides at home .
definitely money well spent .very fun , just enjoyable .if you stay with one of the better brands at a bike store , you will get a bike that will be backed up by the manufacturer , in most cases lifetime warranty on the frame and a year on the parts .if anything is going to happen , usually we notice it out of the box if it 's a damaged item or within the first couple rides .but for the most part , when you buy a quality bike , very , very few problems .
how often should you wash your wig ?it depends on the factors such as air quality and humidity .in some regions of the world , you need to wash it more often because your wig be , starts to look a little more matted or dingy before other places would .usually they say it 's about approximately every eight to twelve wears. [CLS] [SEP]you would want to wash your wig .to wash your wig , you 're going to brush your hair , wig with your wig brush .wig brushes tend to have a little bit more of condensed brushes .they 're more bore bristle in order to be a little bit nicer on the actual hair .they do n't pull as much .so you would brush it with the wig brush .you would then add one tablespoon of your wig shampoo to a sink filled with cold water .you do not need to. [CLS] [SEP]and you should not wash a wig in hot or warm water .you should always keep it cold .you 're going to immerse your wig for one minute and agitate it gently .do not shampoo as if you would shampoo your own head .i usually just kind of do a washing machine effect and put your hand in and just kind of move it around so that way it moves and the hair opens it .do not actually scrub , rub or ring it .we 're then going to rinse it with cold water , twice in order to make sure all the shampoo has comes out .you will then use a slender object , such as maybe a hairspray can. [CLS] [SEP]and you would lay the wig over your hairspray. [CLS] [SEP]can in order for it to be able to air dry , plus have the air go from inside to out , so we can get the underneath .the last thing you want is a moldy wig .then you 're going to spray your wig conditioner onto your wig and use your wig brush in order to brush it through and smooth it .you should use , about every eight to twelve wears , if you should do the shampoo .however , your conditioner , you can in between your shampoos , in order to help smooth , tame , and make your wig look a little more woolly .you can use the conditioner in order to kind of brush through it occasionally , just do n't be too heavy handed because you do n't want it to start getting that wet look. [CLS] [SEP]and you do n't want it to start looking a little more on the oily side .that is how you wash your wig .
here we go again , just into sayunage , into this kubishime choke .i really like this .you can come here , switch and then drop them .simply just pass it to the side , one , two .if you do n't feel like dropping them , again take the thumb down , break their posture , make sure you maintain this control of this arm , and then drop them .sayunage to the kubishime , here .another way you can do this , it 's not from sayunage , but it 's an iriminage choke , is to come in this way .instead of finishing the iriminage technique , step in , plant , grab just like that .grab that hand and put the crank on their neck .from this direction , one , two , three .very painful .if you 've got multiple attackers , this may not be the best choice .as he comes to grab , parry to the side .you 've got your strikes , you 've got your strikes .one of the things i like to do from here , is from here , boom , hit him like this , then get their head up and choke them .remember i talked about the munetsuki , one of the points is that liver 14 point , right down from the nipple , out on the ribcage , that 's what i 'm going to strike into , here , boom .strike like this , then take him over .
the shower , the cartridge is in and now all we 've got to do is turn the water back on and see how it is working .now i just want to tell you that i left the valve open in the shower and the reason you want to do that is when you turn the water on , there is going to be a build up of pressure. [CLS] [SEP]and there is going to be a big air gap where all that water came out when we had the water off .so we want to fill that air gap and it all blown out once you 've turned the water back on .you do n't want any problems as far as bursting a pipe or seal or something like that. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's a good thing to do. [CLS] [SEP]so we just left it open .now let 's go turn off. [CLS] [SEP]the , i 'm sorry turn the water back on with one quick flip of the wrist , here we go .ahhnh , the sound of rushing water .that means it is going to be running in the shower. [CLS] [SEP]so let 's get into the house quick and turn it off .
a lot of people are going to be on different levels. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's important that everybody does n't start off in a dead run or a dead sprint .so steve 's just taking it easy. [CLS] [SEP], he 's got his arms going .he 's going to loosen up all of his muscles .this is something that anybody that 's older can appreciate , just a simple walk .this is what you see people doing at night during the week , walking their dogs and everything else .there 's no race .there 's no race to warm up .steve go ahead and build it up into a little bit of a quicker walk .he 's got himself a little trot there .this is a great way just to get things going .for a lot of people , it 'll be all the conditioning that you need and that 's recommended in a lot of cases .it 's good for older people. [CLS] [SEP], it 's good for everybody at all levels.it 's not hard on the body .what he can do from here he can pick up his pace .then , once he gets really going for a good athletic guy like himself , then he can break it down and we can start to stretch .
 , many of you are familiar with this particular movement .it 's called the chin-up .most people ca n't move their own body weight .i 'm going to show you a way to progress into it more effectively moving your upper body .this is called an assisted chin .what we 're going to use is the squat rack over here .you see i 've got a bar that 's kinda sitting low .it does n't have to be real high .we could even drop down to this next level .what we 're going to do is come underneath the bar , put our feet out , make sure the bar is stable and put our body in a planked position .we are going to come up , stay on our heels , pull our body all the way up. [CLS] [SEP]so our chest touches and then come down , your upper body down .i 'm a little close .i could even turn around and come up the other way .but you could do this at home , put a bar between two chairs , make sure they 're stable so they do n't fall over .but come in here if you 're at the gym , kick through , come up , hold , come down , keep your body in a planked position .great way to develop some upper-body strength using your own body weight , very safe movement .
au lait is a home espresso machine with a steam wand , to be able to steam your milk .and since we 're steaming milk , i like to keep a wet cloth on the top of the espresso machine to wipe down the steam wand after you steam your milk .you 're going to need your cup for assembly and a milk steaming pitcher , your whole milk , and then a-all. [CLS] [SEP]a cafe. [CLS] [SEP]au lait is , is a french for coffee with steamed milk on top .and so , then you 're going to have everything that you would normally make your home coffee with .we 're just going to use a normal home coffee with steamed milk on top .
how to draw a cartoon bus and a cartoon truck .bus is the easiest of all for the vehicles i think .its basically just a big rectangle with rounded corners .the bottom corners can kind of be less rounded .and do n't forget the wheel wells .everytime you draw a vehicle do n't forget those wheel wells .now make this front window kind of look like that .and play around with those side windows as many as you like .you can give it a little detail here , add the fender .so it does n't look compleltely like a box with circles .and you can give it a headlight , but. [CLS] [SEP]basically there is your cartoon bus .now a truck is almost as easy , like an eighteen wheeler .we have kind of a strange shape like a square with the corner. [CLS] [SEP]cut off for the front .the front window , the side window , the cab .and then you just have a great big rectangle for the back .connect them .give yourself a front wheel .and give yourself two wheels for the back part .and remember exactly what i told you , do n't forget the wheel wells , and that 's exactly what i did .but that 's ok.and the rest is just detail .you want to throw some detail in there , draw the door , headlight .but there is your truck and your bus .
how about this ?another day , another beautiful day in northern arizona , with the grand canyon in my background .anyway , let 's talk about straight glide .another perfect opportunity to practice something when you 're getting ready for a class. [CLS] [SEP]or you 're after your class .it is merely a matter of finding just a small , a very small hill .put your front foot in , put your back foot on the board and just glide straight .i 'm going to demonstrate .straight glide , with good athletic stance , knees bent .
now i 'm going to show you how to do the crackle technique .it 's kind of a tricky technique .in a way it 's simple and in a way it 's not .but all you need is he crackle medium .again i 'm using the wax paper for my palette .if you put a real thin coat of crackle medium on you 'll get a real fine crackle .if you use it thick you 'll get wider cracks and a larger crackle which means larger spacing between the cracks .i 'm going to attempt to do both for you on this frame .it looks a lot like varnish .it 's also water base. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's just a special medium .so we 'll put a little bit here .i do n't want to do it all over the frame .and i 'm going to do a little bit down here in this corner .if you do back and forth strokes kind of like cross hatching like this you will get more of a shattered crackle .if you do a technique like this where it 's just one straight line you will get a more uniform crackle .so we 'll do both to let you see how those look .now we have to let that dry for a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]and then we can come back and put our top coat on .
if you are bringing a new adopted dog home it is very important that you know how to introduce your pets with the new dog .hi. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm nancy with utopia animal rescue ranch .we recommend if you adopt a dog. [CLS] [SEP]and you take it home. [CLS] [SEP]it is best for you to have another family member or friend bring your other animals outside on leashes and then start walking .do n't try to get the dogs to know each other immediately .do n't even try to get them close to each other .if you can walk for an hour with these animals , usually by the time you reach home everyone is comfortable with each other , relaxed and they 're not going to be territorial when the new dog comes into the home .it is also very important , do n't forget , when you do get a new dog do n't forget the other dogs , the ones that were there first .they might be jealous and the best thing to do is just show them a little more attention .thank you .i 'm nancy with utopia animal rescue ranch .
next let 's begin painting our sandcastle and crab .now for this it 's going to be a little counterintuitive because we 're going to start with black .and for the black we 're going to color in all the windows first off in our black which is the easy part .this is going to be a situation where you 're going to have to do kind of this first painting step here. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 're going to let it sit for a day and dry .so paint all your windows in a nice black .make sure you do n't have a whole lot of speckles poking through , and then here 's what we 're going to do .we 're actually going to outline our marker in the black as well .you 're like what is this ?this is starting to get like you know a strange castle , kind of a creepy one .is this a haunted house or a nice underwater mural ?all we 're doing by putting the black in here is we 're basically outlining the castle and what you 're going to see we 'll do next. [CLS] [SEP]is we 're going to put like a layer of light brown over which is actually going to kind of cover up a lot of the black anyway. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 'll also go in around the windows .so it 'll basically have the effect of brightening up but at the same time the black will make sure that our different spires and turrets are all looking like they 're still separate .like they still have some lines separating them out which is why we actually use the black for this .so we 'll keep doing this throughout all our different lines on our castle. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 're going to move over to our crab on. [CLS] [SEP]it 's first layer .now i have a nice reddish brown color i put on my foam brush to start filling in our crab .this is a really nice versatile type brush because i can use it to fill in the central section very easily. [CLS] [SEP]and i can also use it for all the contour of the lines very easily .again , as soon as the paint gets light go back and grab yourself some more .you 're going to hopefully at least a whole can of this for yourself .something else. [CLS] [SEP]i also learned the other day , and would be good for you if you 're a muralist on a budget , is going to big hardware stores and asking if they have any extra samples of paint .oftentimes you can get a whole gallon for like five or so bucks .a nice way to save yourself a chunk of change .now you 're going to continue filling in this whole area .one of the reasons i like using the foam brush is because you can kind of turn it on. [CLS] [SEP]it 's edge .you can use it like this sure , but you can also go like this and look at how much easier that is to do to fill in the little eyes .fill a little eye with tendrils going up .much much easier than using a brush .you can do this all the way across until you 've filled it in to your satisfaction .now we 're going to finish filling in , again , like the legs and the pinchers as our first layer. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to use an additional color for some extra definition on our second layer .just make sure you get a nice good solid layer down the first time .so you can see here we 've been adding in black highlights onto our crab .now this has to be done after the red layer has dried. [CLS] [SEP]otherwise it 's going to smear it all together , but adding in some black lines here on the legs and. [CLS] [SEP]also the outline of the claws is a great way to add some extra definition .what 's more it 'll really bring out the eyes adding in some black up there rather than having it be more transparent and blue .
when i start my dotted nail art. [CLS] [SEP]i start with the person 's right pinky nail , which is my left hand side .it 's the same nail that i 've started with this whole time .depending on the size of the person 's nail bed is the size of the stylus you want to choose .joyce has a medium nail bed. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm not going to want to choose my smallest stylus unless she 's just wanting super small dots .the size of the dot you want is also going to depend on the stylus that you are choosing .for joyce 's we are using the next to smallest for her pinky nail .we 're just going to dip the stylus in the polish ; we 're just going to place random dots all over her nail .you may have to re-dip your stylus occasionally to apply some more dots and then when you 're done you want to wipe off your stylus to make sure that the polish that is on the end does not dry up and cause it to start getting stringy over the nail. [CLS] [SEP]and that is how you do your right pinky nail .
today i 'm going to show you how to replace a lamp cord .it 's a pretty common problem around the house .here 's a basic little lamp with the cord on it , we 've got a faulty cord here .basically , what you want to do , is you want to find out where the cord is going into the lamp .okay ?once you figure out which where the cord is going into the lamp , you want to flip it around .on this particular lamp we can tell that it 's got to be accessed through the bottom .so , what we 're going to do is we 're going to move this cover on the bottom. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to expose out lamp cord .okay ?now , nine times our of ten. [CLS] [SEP], if there 's something wrong with the cord , it 's going to be somewhere in between here and here .now , on the inside of it , there 's a knot that 's tied to keep it from pulling out .so , most times , there 's going to be a short , it 's going to be somewhere in here .so , what you can do is just pull this wire back some , take your wire strippers , go ahead and cut that wire out , pull your wire out of the way. [CLS] [SEP], you 've still got your lamp and you 've still got something you can attach your new wires to .then what you want to do is you want to separate these two , here ,just like so .you want to strip these back to expose the wires , like so .once you get them separated a little width apart , you can also tell that on one wire there 'll be some writing and on the other wire there 'll be nothing .the one with the writing on it is the hot wire .okay ?or the black. [CLS] [SEP], in this instance , okay ?so , what you 'll do is you 'll take your replacement cord ,okay ?take your cord , do the same thing .you want to separate it here .it 's actually easier if you use a pair of side cutters you can go ahead and get it started right here .get it split , pull them apart like that , you want to make sure that none of this is exposed , you do n't want any of these two wires touching together .so you want to make sure that that 's all , the plastic sheathing on it 's in good shape .once you figure that out , go ahead and strip that .your electrical wire 's like that .go ahead and figure out which one 's your positive and which one 's your neutral .this one you can tell has the letters on it , so you 're going to match this one up with the same one over here that has the writing on it , just like so .and the other one goes to the other one .once you 've got them put back together like so. [CLS] [SEP], you want to use some electrical tape and you want to make sure you wrap these real well. [CLS] [SEP]so you do n't have any other kind of , these two wires wanting to touch to one another .wrap one of them. [CLS] [SEP]real , real good .wrap it kind of down , away from where the wires are mended together , a couple of times , just like so .in a way you can tell that this wire is not ever going to be able to touch that other one .once you 've got one of them taped up just like that , you come in and bring the other one around just like so , and tape up your seam .and that 's how you replace a lamp cord on a lamp .if you 've got any other questions on how to do this type of repair , you can log on to my website jnchomerepair.com .
now in this segment we 're going to learn what the zoom control is , what the focus control is , and how to use them both .now the zoom control is right over here .all it is really is a not really a trigger , but. [CLS] [SEP]if you 've every played with a remote control cars with the little wheel on it to steer them. [CLS] [SEP], that 's kind of how it is .you want to take it like this , it does have nice little grooves for your fingers to go in , and you always want to use your thumb while controlling it .that way it 's you do have a little more control with your thumb than you can think of .now to zoom in you push to the right hand side .to zoom out you push to the left hand side .now when you 're zooming you always want to make it smooth if it 's on air , if it 's not go right ahead and zoom in fast. [CLS] [SEP], zoom out fast , which ever you want to do .and then with your focus what you want to do to get proper focus on a subject , is you want to zoom in all the way to that subject , and with your focus you want to either take your focus inward or outward .which is actually moving the lens inside inward or outward .now if you go to the left it moves it out , just like with the zoom .if you go to the right it moves it in .and once you have perfect focus , which really you have to look at with your eye. [CLS] [SEP], there 's no button or sensor saying that 's focused .you have to look at it with your eye , and you can tell because it 's going to be a really sharp image .then from there you zoom out , and you set your shot , and then you get ready to go .now you always want to make sure you focus on a subjects eyes if you 're doing a human .that way because obviously the face is going to the subject of the shot , that way you have absolute focus on there .now there are some guys out there that may want to focus on other parts of the body , but that 's not the correct way to do it .
hi welcome back , my name is meagan moe. [CLS] [SEP]and today i am showing you some tips and suggestions for keeping yourself safe from germs when you are working out in your gym .now here we have another piece of equipment that does pose some specific risks. [CLS] [SEP]so i am going to talk to you a little bit about that .this is just a weight machine .it is pretty standard but there are lots of different kinds and what i am going to tell you applies to all of them .now you need to be very careful when using this because as you see there is a pad that people sit down on and. [CLS] [SEP]a lot of times if people are wearing either a tank top or sometimes shorts , their skin is going to make direct contact with this. [CLS] [SEP]so you need to be very careful .now something that is good to do is like everything else spray it with ethanol and let it sit for about a minute before you wipe it off or you can use an antibacterial wipe if that is easier for you .and you want to be sure not to miss the handles which are right here and also if you are wearing shorts or something , you want to be sure if your leg is making direct contact that you clean this piece right down here as well .so just let that sit for a while and let that engage and kill all the bacteria. [CLS] [SEP]and then something else that you want to be very weary of is the pin in the weight stack because this is probably a pretty dirty piece of equipment since people 's hands are touching it all day long .and so something good to do is you do n't have to necessarily disinfect the whole thing. [CLS] [SEP]but if you are going to grab it. [CLS] [SEP]and you have maybe an antibacterial wipe in your hand or a towel you can go ahead and just grab it with that when you pull it out and that way you do n't have to make direct contact with it .also if you are more comfortable you can always take a towel and if you are more comfortable when you sit down you can cover this part of the machine up here if your legs are exposed or if maybe you are wearing a tank top and your shoulders are exposed. [CLS] [SEP]you can always put it up here .basically wherever your skin is going to be making direct contact is probably your primary concern and. [CLS] [SEP]where you want to put the most attention into .and so that 's a weight machine and next i 'm going to show you a little bit of information about the free weights and the dumb bells and what you can do to protect yourself from germs in there .
are you ready for an advanced combo with you rocking reverse undulation ?i 'm johanna , and this is karen , and we 're here with hip expressions belly dance studio in st. [CLS] [SEP]petersburg , florida .so let 's start with our rocking reverse undulation traveling backwards .so our right foot 's going to be back , our timing is scooping in the back .ready , and , back , two , three , roll up .keep it going , and back , two , three , roll up .good .now we 're going to switch it to going forward .slow it down .six , seven , eight .now forward , back , forward , back , forward , back , forward , back .now we 're going to switch it going back .forward , six , seven , eight .and back , front , back .and i 'll do it from the side. [CLS] [SEP]so you can see .switch it forward just a little faster .and it 's forward , back , forward , forward , back and hold .and back , forward , back , back and hold , and forward two , three , four , forward two , three and switch .back two , three , back two , three .good .make sure you practice that in front of a mirror , and soon you 'll have a nice , smooth undulation that goes forward and back .
ok.now we 've got all our heart shaped petals cut out in front of us .and we have the base for our flower .we 're just going to flip our flower over. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're also going to want to take the pattern side of your flower and flip it over as well .and you 're going to want to line up your points , just along the edge of the flower .and you can flip it back over , pinching it , because you 're going to want to see a good amount of that petal sticking out .and you 're going to want to take either tacky glue or an elmer 's school glue and just on the edge of your photo , squeeze some glue down .make a little line down .make a little line .and , again , start just placing the points of those petals down .and if you made a lot of glue , you can do a few at a time , and you want them to overlap so that when you place your petals down and you pick it up they 're overlapping petals .and you 're going to continue this process all the way around the edge of your photo until you have all your petals and the whole edge of your photo covered .just like that .
let 's play our g harmonic minor scale .that 's our g harmonic minor scale , okay .now we 'll go over the first degree of our scale which is g ,okay ?we play g as a open g ,okay ?it 's one of our open strings on the violin .that 's the first degree of our scale .the notes named g. [CLS] [SEP]it 's scale degree one , okay ?so next , we 'll learn about the second scale degree .
we just trims the dog ears off with our little scissors .and this gets rid of that. [CLS] [SEP]so it matches our other piece real well .and some people save theses little pieces of fabric and make quilt jelly out of it .you ca n't eat it though .you put it in a jar ; put a lid on it , a nice pretty lid on it .it 's called quilt jelly .now then , we are going to find our strips , we got two strips we got to sew together now .i have these cut here .it 's a light and a dark and we are going to sew them 1/4 inch seams .put our ends together and sew this all the way down .then we will be cutting this after we stitch this .okay , we are going to start on our lead fabric , our starter scrap piece of fabric. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to sew a 1/4 of an inch all the way down .keep the edge together .i do n't think i mentioned that the block we are working on today is called monkey wrench .when you need to , stop and adjust again. [CLS] [SEP]so you have your edges together .
okay , we 're going to do a little combination here .we 're going to go ahead and go for the crotch. [CLS] [SEP]and then , while we 're there , we 're going to go ahead and hit in the gut with a butt of our bo staff .first move , we 're going to go ahead , boom , just like earlier today .what you 're doing over here , you 're leaving some slack .you 're holding up the stick like this. [CLS] [SEP], you 're moving up the stick to the tip , and then you 're adding in some slack with some sliding motion , heading for the crotch .ideally , this will hurt the person very much so , but if you want to go ahead and finish them off , bam right there , stepping into it or you can even step in towards the head , bam and such .now , if the opponent starts off with coming towards you , in the back , then you can go ahead and just start off with the back and then go in for a forward crotch , side again .again , if they 're coming towards you , go ahead and just spot them in the back , boom , the head , boom .from this position , just slide it in , just start start sliding with the bo and slide in , bam , right here .it 's all about coming up with combinations .you can come up with your own combinations , but i suggest you go ahead and look into akido for some various sound .kada combinations that you could go ahead and learn from , and perhaps , bisect and create your own ones , but for the time being , that 's something you might want to consider .butt , crotch , crotch , face , or do different combinations ; face , crotch , crotch , face , gut , crotch and such .get creative , not too creative .do n't go crazy on your opponent , but you do want to match up with something reasonable and sound , and that 's how you start with combinations with the crotch and the butt of your bo stick .
probably , the most used component in circuit bending is going to be the potentiometer .here i have a slide potentiometer right here .this is one is one that adjusts with a thumb wheel and. [CLS] [SEP]then i have the most common potentiometer , i have the knob .and these can be found on almost anything .anytime you 're turning a radio dial , anytime you 're adjusting the volume on your stereo , what you are actually manipulating is this , and what 's inside here is a little wiper .what happens is that wiper is connected to a piece of graphite , and as i turn it , it 's going to move across that piece of graphite toward one side or toward the other side .now you can see we have the sides here .if you connect up a signal to this side and you turn it all the way over in that direction , then the wiper is going to be connecting the middle with this side .as i turn the wiper away from that side , there 's a greater distance between these two connections therefore a greater resistance .and that causes in our circuit bending -- that causes greater change .so that 's when i get that pitch shift when i have this circuit coming in and disrupting the flow from one side to the other .for these circuits , generally you just need to connect up two of these .if you connect that from the middle to one side , you 're good .if you want to turn the knob the other direction , all you have to do is connect from the middle to the other side. [CLS] [SEP]and then your control will go the other way .just try experimenting with them and realize that they come in many different shapes and sizes. [CLS] [SEP]but essentially they do the same things .once again , they come in different values as well .if you 're looking at an on-line supplier or looking at a local electronic store , this one is a 20k potentiometer .that 's a pretty good value .i recommend that you keep around a 10k potentiometer , a 100k potentiometer , a 1 meg potentiometer , and a 2-meg potentiometer .that way you have the four major values , so 10 , 100k , and 1 meg , and 2 meg .these 2 meg potentiometer was the one we we 're actually using and the one we 're going to use in this circuit .so , keep a couple around .you just got to do it by trial and error to figure out which one works best .that 's the potentiometer or a knob in a nutshell .
so the next two aspects of the open hi-hat that i want to talk about -- these are kind of more of accessory sounds .if you 're trying to get a little out , they 're not going to use a whole lot , but if you want to get some kind of special textures , you can use these sounds .and this is getting the wash out of the hi-hat. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's the sound that you get when you start to have a lot of the different overtones from the cymbals. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're striking the side of the cymbals -- or towards the edge of the cymbal .that 's what 's going to affect the wash.so this is striking the side of the hi-hat getting that wash sound .it 's a bit of a crash , you know .if you want just kind of another crash in your vocabulary -- a smaller one than your eighteen and your seventeen , whatever you have around your kit -- you can use that .that 's always an option .the other aspect of the hi-hat -- also not used often but good to know about just because it 's a different texture and color -- is going to be your dome , and you can play it open .it 's that real piercing sound like it 's time to eat , and you can also play it when it 's closed .it 's a real choked sound --just adds another flavor , another texture , another color to your musical soundscape .
receivers to do more blocking , maybe an extra tight end to do more blocking , again you 've declared you have six people up here. [CLS] [SEP]and you can move them quickly to the flow of the ball and be able to stop most of the runs that they bring at you .unless they start doing a lot of miss direction , if offenses start doing a lot of miss direction to where their giving flow one way and then bringing a running back another way to where their getting you to flow , then you 've got to start playing what we call more of a base defense where your just gap control. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 've got to be strong enough up here to win the battle one on one against your offensive person because if the offense is better at one on one blocking and being able to move you. [CLS] [SEP]then it 's a long day for a four-two defense because they ?re going to be able to run the ball at will on you and create seams to move the football down the field .
the compound patterns divides the body in half in an imaginary vertical line and , what happens part of the pattern is on the left side and the other part of the pattern is on the right side .our first pattern is the 5/4 pattern .what happens on the 5/4 pattern , we have three beats , one two three , on the left side ; and then the other two , four five , on the right side .i 'll show you how that looks .one , two , three , four , five .one , two , three , four , five .now depending on how the music is written , that can be reversed .so instead of having a three plus two pattern , you would have a two plus three pattern .so that would look like , one two three four five , one two three four five .our next one is the 6/4 pattern and , likewise , you have two sides to this .one , two , three , four , five , six .one , two , three , four , five , six .you notice how one two and three is on the left , and four , five and six on the right .one , two , three , four , five , six .one , two , three , four , five , six .finally , i will show you the 7/4 pattern .we have one two three four five six seven , one two three four five six seven .and it would go like this , one two three four five six seven , one two three four five six seven .just like the 5/4 , that can be reversed. [CLS] [SEP]you have four , plus three , one two three four five six seven , one two three four five six seven .there are other subdivisions that can happen ; you can twist these around. [CLS] [SEP]so we have different patterns on each side .that 's why they 're called compound .they should be called complex as well .that is our compound patterns .
hi. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm travis corpening coming to you from carolina beach recreation center ,and i 'm going to show you just how to do a teardrop jump shot .what you want to do first is of all is , it 's really this shot is really effective if you 're in the paint. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're playing again players a lot taller than you .so you 'll see if you watch the nba. [CLS] [SEP]you 'll see a lot of the shorter players in the nba use this and execute this shot .what they do is they want to come in the paint , and as they come in the paint , as they see it 's just like a regular shot except you shoot it with one hand , and you do it to the point where the defensive man never expected you to shoot it .so you come into the paint , and as you come into the paint you do n't want to directly look at the basket until the very last minute .you already have spotted the basket , but you want to look as though you do n't know. [CLS] [SEP], you have know idea what you 're about to do .so you come in , and as you look around you see the defender in front of you , then you can start to look toward the basket .spot the basket , and as you do as soon as you spot the basket , you want to throw it up with one hand .and that 's what makes it so effective .it 's unexpected .you want to throw it up wit one hand , but you to practice it first because this can be a little difficult in the paint .you want to throw it up with one hand to where you drop the ball directly into the basket , so that the defensive man can not get it .you want to throw it up high enough to where the defensive man ca n't block it .so there you have it the teardrop jump shot .
it 's really important now that you 've practiced your song , to make yourself a little audition check list .especially if this is your first time .this will help you when you 're nervous .so make sure you show up prepared with everything you need .on your audition checklist , you should have your song , your head shot and resume , your outfit .now i recommend bringing your outfit with you .there 's always a place to change .that way it does n't get wrinkled in the car , you do n't get it sweaty and when you 've changed , you are crisp and ready to go .you also might need to bring dance clothes and appropriate dance wear .if it 's a movement call , bring sneakers .do n't try to do a movement call in flip flops or bare feet .besides the fact that you might fall down , you 'll make the choreographer nervous because this is a recipe for disaster .you might want to bring a snack .if you 're not union , you could have a long wait ahead of you .you do n't want to wait for eight hours or six hours on an empty stomach .the other thing you want to make sure you bring are your directions .do you know where you 're going and how you 're going to get into the room ?where are you going to park ?write these things down and check them off before you load yourself into your car and. [CLS] [SEP]you 'll be much more comfortable at your audition .
today i 'm going to discuss interactive games to do when babysitting .interactive games can be both inside and outside .inside interactive games can be board games .make sure that if you 're doing a board game that it 's age appropriate and that the child understands the concept of the game .additional interactive games in the house may include arts and crafts , things that have the two of you interact with one another .if there is a grouping of children , more than one , you may have a couple of different activities going on at the same time .if you 're working with board games some of the children may want to play one board game , while the little ones may want to play one that 's more age appropriate .allow them all to play and give them ownership of the game .while different groups will be playing , make sure that you interact with them as well .outside interactive games may include playing tag , or even red light and green light .make sure that before you play outside interactive games that the location is safe and that you have permission to go outside .so remember , be dependable , be safe , and always be on time .
it 's something that i 've just really been quite excited about .working with tissue papers and doing collage with wax just really is a lot of fun , and what i 've liked to work with is these papers that are called [ ph ] josh papers .you would find these in an asian market , in the hardware section .they 're just wonderful , colorful papers to work with and imbed into the wax .you can use other tissue papers that you find at , really , specialty paper shops ; they also work great , and even things like angelina , which is sort of like a fancy packing material that can be imbedded into the wax , produces some interesting results .i 've even used coffee filters .that 's a coffee filter imbedded in the wax with some metallic wax on top .here 's a couple of christmas ribbons in here .and then , when we were talking about monoprinting before , i just cut long strips of paper , waxed them , and flipped them over , heated the backside to create these patterns .this is even a little piece of us postal --oh , i should n't say it --tyvek material. [CLS] [SEP]; i think it 's also a plastic material. [CLS] [SEP]but when it 's heated , it crinkles all up , and then you can wax on top of that .here 's just a can that i heated up and made some marks on paper and a couple of the stylus .altogether , you can create kind of an interesting composition with tissues and wax .
you are going to want to go to the next , this is where the capture page .now you can either convert something directly to the video. [CLS] [SEP]all capture and editing programs even these really basic ones usually have a little where it has the files .in this case we have a file under family reunion we are going to hit open and that file is going to be added to the line on the bottom .let 's for instance if you wanted to a add a slide show even with the videos on your file dvd. [CLS] [SEP]then you can add a slide show .grab your jpeg and it would show up down here on the bottom .so what you want to do is want to get familiar with any items even though they are all different they are very similar to .
you 're going to have to add friends , customize your profile , make your own background layout , add special table contents , keep up with your friends .when they comment you try to comment them back .when they write you a message try to message them back .if you 're a musician or a filmmaker , that 's especially important to keep your visibility .
okay , let 's reach up high , stretch high , rise up out of your hips and then bend forward , dropping down .from here , we want to touch the floor .now , if you ca n't touch the floor with your legs straight , unlock your knees until you can get your hands down on the floor .it does n't necessarily matter how much you need to bend your knees , just so that you can get to the floor .and then , from here , we 're going to wag our tailbone from side to side , stretching the backs of our legs , the lower back , and the hip .once you get this motion going , return to your breathing and relax .
musicals usually feature characters engaged in dialogue and then all of a sudden , they break into song .usually , these characters are larger than life , and also , they 're accompanied by an orchestra or a band .there are many examples of successful musicals , `` chicago , '' `` rent , '' `` wicked , '' `` cats . [CLS] [SEP]''these musicals usually feature a character coming on stage and engaging in a dialogue and then all of a sudden the music comes up and usually though , they 'll feature long lines of dialogue and they 'll feature the rhythm of the music and they 'll usually have large sets .usually , a musical can have a set that slides out , and then another set slides in .they 're very spectacle driven .it 's just the nature of how a musical goes .so if you 're thinking about writing a musical , first off , you want to think , do have someone who can write music or can you write music yourself ?do you have the ability to assemble a musical that you ca n't -- you could potentially do a musical with a little home keyboard , but it kinda lacks the epic scope of a musical and what a musical is expected to be .these are some of the things you might look at when considering maybe writing a musical .
and we are back. [CLS] [SEP]can you smell the garlic and the thyme infusing the vegetables .i can it smells wonderful .so now you are going to want to turn off your heat and give a little check. [CLS] [SEP]it looks beautiful , make sure and take your pot holders and take it off and the best part about straining is it is all done .you take it out and look it is all done you are going to want to take your pot , you are going to want to come over here. [CLS] [SEP]and i always like to set it on one of my pots on one of my pot holders , open her up , and you got the wonderful vegetables just coming a waiting to get out .then you are going to want to take them and just arrange the on our plate like so and. [CLS] [SEP]the best part of it is you can take them. [CLS] [SEP]and they do n't even need any salt and pepper .they 're wonderful .a little bit hot but extra yummy .enjoy !
so make sure you got room for them. [CLS] [SEP]but once they start coming in with the crop. [CLS] [SEP]well that is when things really began to pay off .now a lot of people have a tendency to over plant these and that is when you start ended up with a bags full of zucchini on your door step because the guy the road decided that he buy the whole 6 pack and plant the whole 6 pack. [CLS] [SEP]so maybe you just need 1 or 2 zucchini plants and that would take care of you and probably your friends and family as well .but summer squash is the yellow type the yellow goer neck type i ca n't get enough. [CLS] [SEP]we have put in a lot of plants .the other trick here is i do n't like to wait until they get really big and. [CLS] [SEP]one squash feeds the whole family i like to get them when they are small. [CLS] [SEP]they tend to be more tender , more flavorful , more concentrated in there flavors. [CLS] [SEP]and they really really are taste of summer for me that is why they are often called summer squash .some of the things that you have to worry about as your growing your summer squash , squash beetles. [CLS] [SEP]they are going to show up they are little orange guy with black strips on them. [CLS] [SEP]he is going to start chewing at your leaves and you would first notice that your leaves are kind of getting skeltonize. [CLS] [SEP]there is a look almost like the lace to them as he chews all the part in between the veins .its one of those things that when they show up they could do damage fast so keep a eye out for them both at those little over stage where they look like a little orange pale and later for that beetle that has the stripes on him .now that is just one type of squash and there is a lot of other squashes out there things like pumpkins. [CLS] [SEP]are consider squash or another one that i have grown in my garden is acorn squash .now this is a real new england flavor me. [CLS] [SEP]and maybe you have seen them with that dark green skin and that orangey flash. [CLS] [SEP]it just have that flavor to it that it is a little reminiscing of pumpkin. [CLS] [SEP]but it is again on of those falls things .a fall flavor for me just a little butter a little cinnamon , cut them in half , put them on a roasting pan and give them say a half hour or 40 minutes until there are tender and that is about as good as eating in the garden. [CLS] [SEP]it gets .so all the way from summer with your summer squash to fall with your acorns squash , squash make really good eating in the garden .
he 's got c , b , a , a , b , c.so , now as a quarterback you 're dropping back , you 're trying to get the ball off. [CLS] [SEP]and now you 've six people rushing you .well there 's six coming. [CLS] [SEP]and you 've got only have five offensive linemen here. [CLS] [SEP]so they can only theoretically block five of them .if you have a running back back here he 's got to block the extra one .now , the theory on this is though for these guys to hit it at the right time and these guys to be quick enough off the ball to where you mess up the concentration of your line and the coordination of your back. [CLS] [SEP]and someone misses their block. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 've got people coming free and getting on the quarterback immediately before he has a chance to get rid of the ball .now , saying that this would be a full blitz out of this three-three front .
so as you get more comfortable in the feet , the stability of that leg , that supports the kicking leg , the balance , we can add a little more height .so let 's take it middle high .using the hands to support the feet , finding your middle , your high .`` pah '' !kick , kick , step back , switch .a little moment of hesitation , before you kick , cause you 're sneaking up. [CLS] [SEP]and then you kick them out the door .low , middle high , middle high right there .continuing to breathe let your breath support the kick .sense the agility , flexibility in your knees , ankles to support the kick .last one . [CLS] [SEP]`` pah '' !martial arts kicks .
so at this point you want to get your scoring rib ready. [CLS] [SEP]so you can make these connection happen .so i 'm going to grab about this much clay .cut it at an angle. [CLS] [SEP]and you just attach it to there and there , and then do there .alright .throw that form back in there .alright .i like .check the other side .i like my little handles on my things to look like little arms .it makes my pots come alive .this is a little thick so i 'm just going to thin it down .no problem .just take a couple runs through it .you can see where it starts to pull you can see the integrity of the clay getting really messy .i do n't want to mess with that just go ahead and get rid of it and pull another handle out .spend too much time messing around with something like that. [CLS] [SEP]and you just get frustrated .just get rid of it .alright we 're not saving lives here .we 're going to go ahead and score , score , score. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 've got to remember how much clay i cut off for the last one .put another one on there .attach it .like that .with vases i like to leave those little .i 'm not even going to touch it .it 's done .
alright .so now you have a lot of tricks together and your arsenal of four ball tricks , it 's time to come up with a four ball routine .well , it 's kind of like coming up with a three ball routine in a sense that you need a beginning , a middle and an end .the difference however is you can seamlessly go into a four ball routine from a three ball routine using the toe stall that i talked about the pickup , you can have three , you can be do. [CLS] [SEP]your three ball routine and the whole time have one laying on the floor and scoop it up like i showed earlier .but , four ball routines are even more essential to have tricks that flow in and out of each other , because the chances of balls colliding , the chances of you kind of getting messed up are so much greater .so you really have to take a lot of time to figure out what goes into what seamlessly and easily .ok , those go into each other very easily , but if i try to go into a shower right there that does n't work .so you need to figure out a way to make ,if that 's what you want to do next the shower , you need to find out a way to seamlessly going into it .ok ?and there 's a million ways you can do that .you pick , the best ways to do it is pick the trick that you want to do and deconstruct it until you can figure out the first minimal throw you need to make in order to go into that pattern .then all you need to do is pick a cool beginning and a cool end .so there you go .now you can make your own four ball juggling routine .
this flavor is cherry ginger and when we get to the bottling process i will talk more how the flavors are made .i 'm going to pour out little samples for everyone here while i talk about some of the health benefits of kombucha .the biggest health benefit i believe from kombucha is the fact that it helps alkaline the blood .now what is that ?the ph of our blood is determined by the types of food that we eat meat , dairy products , and other things contribute to acidic blood stream .a acidic blood stream is a magnet for sickness. [CLS] [SEP]we can contour act. [CLS] [SEP]that by eating fruits , vegetables , citrus fruits especially and kombucha .so it helps the body heal itself at the cell. [CLS] [SEP]you level your body could function and heal itself .some of the other things it helps questioning , it increase metabolism , immune support , appetite control , it helps with weight lose , again with the increase metabolism , liver function , it also serves as a detox , and anti aging , cell integrity in some people say that it turns there gray hair back to its natural color .so now you may wonder how much should i be drinking .it is best to start every morning on a empty stomach about 4 ounces that is half a glass. [CLS] [SEP]and then i will say listen to your body .this is a exciting journey for you , this is a place where you can invite nature to come back and live in harmony with your body .your inviting the healthy yeast and bacteria to live in your intestines and to heal you from the inside out .and if you are looking to lose weight and using kombucha for that specific practice it is recommended that you have a 4 ounce glass before every meal .it also help with digesting so. [CLS] [SEP]if you are feeling like you have a upset tummy having a little bit of that would also help smooth you out .also if you are trying to detox from alcohol. [CLS] [SEP]maybe you have a hangover or something. [CLS] [SEP]kumbucha is really good for that as well .because it is detox it is important that you drink a lot of water afterwards to help flush out the toxins .
hi , i 'm emily larew and we 're going to look at hip hop lunges crossing back with a turn .so continuing on , our feet are together. [CLS] [SEP]you 're going to step out .i 'm going to pull my pants so you can see just my feet. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 'll just add on .what you 're going to do is step out on the right cross back with the left. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're on the ball of your foot .step out , cross back that is all we 're doing , step cross back , step cross back .now i really would like to stylization to lead with your heel as you step out cross back , heel cross back , heel cross back , heel cross back .alright , with your arms this is what i want you to do , you 're going to step out and snap it open with your opposite hand .so we 're going to go out. [CLS] [SEP], we 're going to bring it down , cross back and go straight down .it 's like you get over here now ,alright you 've been told that before , now .alright , so we step out. [CLS] [SEP]so we go 1 and down and reverse your arm. [CLS] [SEP]so we got right arm ,left foot goes out .so step out bring it down ,okay let 's speed it up , 5 6 7 , so we go out bring it down , out. [CLS] [SEP]bring it down , heel toe down , heel toe down , 1 2 3 get down do n't give me a shady little lowness here .i do n't want to see you do this ; this is not how we get down , get low , get low ,alright .adding the turn with it you 're going to do three of them with a backwards spin .so feet are together. [CLS] [SEP]we go 1. [CLS] [SEP]this is 2. [CLS] [SEP], this is 3 from here. [CLS] [SEP]your left foot is crossed behind .all you 're going to do is from here unwind all the way around together , alright .then you 're going to reverse it. [CLS] [SEP]so left down , 2. [CLS] [SEP], you have 3 your right foot is behind. [CLS] [SEP]so you 're going to turn towards the right .if you want to try to go to the left. [CLS] [SEP]you see how i. [CLS] [SEP]'m all tangled up and it does n't really work .so if you are here you are going to push off your back foot and around , back up with your feet together .so here we go , we got 1 down , 2 down , 3 turn to the left and use this arm to open you up and spin around , 3 together .left down , right this is a 3rd one , which way are going to turn ?to the right and around , ready. [CLS] [SEP]let 's do it quick , 1 2 3 4 5 6 roll it and. [CLS] [SEP]1 2 3 4 5 6 spin it back .that is your hip hop lunges to the back with a turn .
hi , my name is madeline franco and we 're here to talk about birds , specifically we 're here to talk about adopting a bird .this here is molly , she 's a bare-eyes cockatoo , she is an adopted bird .she was previously loved and they taught her how to say something like `` hello molly '' ,but i 'm not sure what that is .if you are considering having a parrot , you might want to consider adopting one .there are many fine adoption situations available and very many people involved in finding homes for birds .it 's called re-homing birds .i belong to the wasatch avian education society which is located in utah , and i 'm also the president of the southern nevada parrot education rescue and re-homing society .responsible pet rescues , including parrot rescues , will arrange for there to be a health check on the birds that they try to adopt out and very often they 'll put them in foster homes as a first step which helps the bird re-socialize and enables you to get a reasonably tame , well adjusted bird .molly , here , has adjusted really well to being a member of a new flock. [CLS] [SEP]and i think she rather likes it .she was an only bird , as far as i know , prior to this .or a bird with just a few birds around the house ,but she seems to enjoy the community that she 's in right now .the adoption fees associated with taking in a previously loved bird , are often less than what you would pay for a bird retail .but there are still those people who want to have young , baby birds , and. [CLS] [SEP]that 's okay too .adoption is just another thing you can think about .so , if you 've got a local adoption agency in your town you might want to look into it .
hey there .we are talking about types of persuasion that you might be looking at as you write your great persuasive speech .next we 're going to take a look at questions of policy .now , this is one that you might want to play with , you might not want to play with .value might be a little more exciting for you , but when we talk about a speech , a persuasive speech , dealing with question of policy , what we 're looking at is what should be done .okay , it has to do with laws and things in existence. [CLS] [SEP]and we want to talk about changing them .like procedures that are followed .an example might be a sexual harassment policy at a college or a job .what is the procedure that we follow and should we change that procedure ?you might want to talk about that .laws changed , and this is where those of you ,i know a lot of you as soon as you got this assignment , you were thinking you already knew what you wanted to write your persuasive speech about and that was legalization of marijuana .okay , this is going to be a speech question of policy , laws changed .you can talk about legalization of marijuana , but what you 're going to be doing is proving that the law that is status quo right now has to be changed .and then you 're going to present to me why it has to be changed .and it better be good .
so we want to talk about draws that you almost always have to fold and basically i 've only put out one example. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's because this is the hand that hangs up most players .it 's called an inside straight draw .what that is , is you 've got four to a straight but. [CLS] [SEP]instead of missing a card on the end that gives you eight outs , you are missing a card in the middle that gives you four outs .if you have four outs and you have one draw round which is what we 're talking about in five card draw .then you have an approximately eight percent chance at catching that out .you have n't. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm talking about an eight percent chance of discarding this six and having it turn into a nine .so think about how many times does eight divide into one hundred .well it 's eleven and a half. [CLS] [SEP]so you know again we 're talking about getting great odds if you call .rarely in five card draw will you be getting eleven and a half or around that to one to justify the call .so almost always i hope you will throw this hand into the muck .
so i already have my hair sectioned off into the back sections .what i 'm going to do is come up. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to pull down a little bit of hair. [CLS] [SEP]and i want to make sure that i 'm taking clean and even partings .i 'm going to go ahead and pin this up out of my way .so this is going to be my first section. [CLS] [SEP]now my cape is getting in my way of my guideline .so i 'm going to go ahead and take that off for a few seconds .i 'm actually going to use her neck as a stabilizer for my hand and that way to i can actually go ahead and carve out that area that i need .since i need this to kind of come up in an angle. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to start at an angle. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to come straight down .i 'm going to go ahead and do the other side first .this is where i 'm going to use the back of her neck to help me out. [CLS] [SEP]so what i 'm going to do is comb the hair straight down on her neck pressing against .i 'm going to hold my hand here. [CLS] [SEP]so i hold the hair in place. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to come in and get rid of all these little extra hairs .as you can see when i 'm cutting. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm obviously wanting to leave a length on the sides because if you remember we 're going to have the haircut going from short and gradually going into long .i 'm going to do the same thing on the other side , you need to make sure that she 's even .at this point what i 'm going to do is i 'm just going to kind of let the hair naturally fall. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'm going to see where i need to adjust my line .i 'm not going to use any attention. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm just going to let the hair naturally fall where it needs to go .still making sure that my sides are longer than the middle section of my hair cut .so at this point this is going to be my starting point and my guide for the following sections that are going to end up coming down .stay tune for the next segment which i 'm going to show you how to cut the back section of the hair cut .
hi , i 'm natanya nielsen from saratoga springs , utah .we 're talking about crochet basics .today we 're going to talk about the double crochet .to make a double crochet in your project at the point where you 're ready to turn your row , you will chain three .this chain three , as you turn your project , becomes your first double crochet for that row .if you 'll notice , you have a hole right here , from your previous row of stitches .that 's where your hook will go in .the first thing you do is wrap your yarn around your hook .then with two loops on your hook , you will run your hook through the hole that you created , and pull up another loop , and pull it through the first loop on your hook .then you will wrap your yarn around , come through the first two loops , wrap your yarn again , and come through the last two loops .we 're going to do that one more time .you 're going to wrap your yarn around. [CLS] [SEP]so you have two loops on your hook .i like to hold mine with my fingers so they do n't slip off .then i will go back through my project in that hole , grab a loop , and pull that up .then i will wrap my yarn around again , pull it through the first two loops , and again wrap my yarn around and pull it through the two remaining loops on my hook .that is a double crochet .
first off interval training is where we go out to a full sprint , try to get up to a maximum heart rate and run until we ca n't really push ourselves any more and then have a full recovery .interval training is where we physically exert ourself for a specific amount of time and then recover for that same amount of time .so let 's just use for example say we are running , we want to increase our speed or our pace especially for a 5 k or a 10 k or a marathon or something like that where we run full out for let 's say ten minutes .then we are going to drop back almost to a walk or a fast walk and recover for ten minutes. [CLS] [SEP]let our heart rate come down , we 'll get the air back in our lungs. [CLS] [SEP]and then as soon as that ten minutes is up we will go right back to it again where we are running full out and almost at dead sprint for another ten minutes and then have that recovery time for another ten minutes .interval training as opposed to endurance training is a lot shorter because we are really taking our heart rate up and keeping it there for a long period of time. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to burn ourselves out quicker .the amount of energy expenditure over a 60 minute period of time for an endurance runner is going to be that about the equivalent of about 20 minutes of doing interval training .so the treadmill is a wonderful tool to use to do that especially as a training method because it 's a low impact machine , it 's going to help save our joints and also we 're going to be able to maintain and monitor the changes that we make using the display on the treadmill .that 's been how to do interval training .i 'm aaron hale at fitness for life .
so basically with that , their immune system , what happens is if they have the peanuts they 're allergic to , the egg that they 're allergic to , wheat , milk , soy , whatever that allergen happens to be , their immune system gets all riled up and what happens is all this histamine gets actually flooded into the body and that 's where you get those other reactions ; the hives , eczema , or the mucusy problems or any of those other issues , the stomach issues .and basically , all that does it actually makes an exhaust in your child 's adrenal glands and their immune system .and basically all they can do , is later on in life , they may have seemingly unrelated health issues because of this little small , little thing like wheat , eggs , peanuts , soy , milk or anything like that .and you do n't want that to happen .you want to make sure that they are ultimate health , and if they are allergic to these foods , not only is their immune system flooding their body and stressing all their organs out , but they 're actually not even absorbing the nutrients from these nice , healthful things .so if they 're not , if they 're actually allergic to these foods , it 's not going to be healthy for them .so either alleviate them or you can do other things to help them out .
hi , i 'm angela martindale and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm talking to you about how to get out of obesity in twelve weeks .nutrition and lifestyle , which is step two of your program is extremely important .it 's important to eat five small meals a day , keeping your metabolism revved up .shooting your proteins and clean clean vegetables and clean carbs .now that would mean lowering the glycemic index .and you can look up any glycemic index on the internet in any nutritional book .you want to be under fifty in every food that you eat on the glycemic index .it 's important not to have starchy foods , sugary foods , and yeast free foods .stay away from high fat and milk products .this is a change in your lifestyle that will make huge , huge results .this is a change in your lifestyle that will be incredible and you will see amazing results .
so , now we 're in my bedroom , and the first thing that we want to look for , like we have in every room , is things , are things that i do n't need , that i do n't want , that are broken , that i want to give away .and , some kind of key places to look in the bedroom , for those kinds of things , are the bed side , bed side table , where random things tend to collect .and , the desk , if you have a desk in your room .this kind of serves as my desk .any closets or cabinets that you might have in your room .shelves , these kinds of places .you 're going to want to look for things that you do n't need , you do n't want any more , are broken .so , for instance , i might , i 've actually already done this .but , i 've gone through my journals , gone through these blank books , and some of them , that i 'd just kept notes in , that i did n't need any more .i 've thrown those away. [CLS] [SEP]and i donated a couple of blank books , that i had n't written in at all .underneath on my bedside table , i gave away some of the books that had accumulated there , and there were a couple of knick knacks , that i got rid of and donated .so , that 's all kind of in the service of just cleaning things up , so that i , when getting rid of things , so that i do n't , so i have less to move .
first place , nine out of ten times , you signed a financial affidavit with your divorce attorney , at the time of divorce , so many circumstances vary with this one , and depending on your jurisdiction within your divorce , what state you 're in , and what county .the other thing also depends on the benefits administrator .you might want to check with them , in terms , of if you can assign a 401k to someone else , or not .the other thing is , that also you may be able to work out a trade , where in lieu of breaking up your 401k , you may be able to give some other asset , so that you can keep your retirement plan intact .these are all things that should be discussed with your attorney , and they should also be certainly in line , with what 's happening in your jurisdiction .most people have other assets , if they have a 401k , so you should be able to work some kind of barter out , if possible .with that in mind , i would like to say good luck to you , and please always consult your attorney , on these matters .thank you , and have a great day .dr. [CLS] [SEP]felicia .
in this clip i 'm going to show you how to make a pony tail .we have nice , pretty hair here .we 're going to go ahead and brush it and make it nice and soft and easy to manage when we do the pony tail .now , depends on how you want to wear your pony tail .if you want to wear the pony tail high , you come up high like this , and it 's really great for the young people , they usually love to wear their pony tail 's high , especially young girls , high school girls , and cheerleader 's , and all that stuff .they usually wear the pony tail 's real , real high .you want to take it and brush it , make it neat .this is actually in the middle of the head .you can take it and put it in there like that , little band for the hair .you 've got yourself a medium sized cute pony tail .look how nice her hair is , it 's fluffy .you see , now that 's me. [CLS] [SEP], that 's right in the middle .it can go up here in the middle of the head , it can go even lower than that , ok.business women wear theirs a little low sometimes , all the way down here .this is is liz muller , and this is how to make a pony tail .
so , you find your gap , and go ahead , come up to it , ollie regular , that way you get the feel for it and the timing , and then you can go ahead and try to switch ollie .and that 's how you switch ollie a flat gap .just remember , use those five steps , good flip position , pop , slide your foot , suck up , and land on the bolts .
and , we want to continue to whisk and make it a very nice and smooth consistency .and , with the ganache as most ganache recipes. [CLS] [SEP]( there 's many of them out there )it 's best to make it a day ahead of time .and , let is setup overnight .you can also use a chocolate butter cream frosting or whatever kind of flavor your prefer .i like the chocolate ganache , myself .
well there are several reasons , but the most important one is it 's just plain cool .the second one is , if you look behind me , the guitars you see on the wall .to build or to buy a comparable guitar would probably cost you anywhere between $ 3 ,000 to $ 5 ,000 .if you were to build one of the guitars that you see on the wall behind me , you can probably build it for somewhere around $ 700 .that 's a really big difference .one of the most important things about building your own guitar is that you can not only choose what type of guitar you build , but you can choose what sort of scale it has , how it plays , whether it 's electric .you can choose the pickups , the electronic layout , the actual size of the guitar and , even more importantly , you can contour neck to fit your hand , to be exactly the way you want to make your playing as easy as possible .ideally what you want to do when you build your own guitar , and one of the most important reasons for building your own guitar , is to make an instrument that removes any impediment to you being able to play the best that you can possibly play .a good guitar can make a bad player good ; a great guitar can make a great player famous .
and then the second link has a pin on it .then i 've skipped a link and i 've got the next pin .i 've got seven pins across on the chain .so , the next stage , means that we will have to attach this chain to the earring component .in order to do that , we need to very small jump rings .take the end link of the chain , we hold the jump ring with a pair of pliers. [CLS] [SEP]and then we simply slip the chain onto the jump ring .then once we 've done that , slip the jump ring through the hole .see i 've got the three holes here .make sure its on the bottom of the earring , on either the left or the far right of the earring piece .then we need two pairs of pliers in order to close the jump ring .wiggle it back and forth till it 's closed. [CLS] [SEP]and we do the same thing again on the other side .we 're slipping the jump ring through the hole and closing it again with two pairs of pliers like so .okay , now its starting to look more like an earring .for the third piece , i 've already taken my three beads .this time i 've decided to use an austrian crystal in the middle just to give it more of a focal affect .i 've already bent the pin over just to start off the loop. [CLS] [SEP]and then you slip it in through the middle loop .grasp the pin , and then with your second pair of pliers wrap it around .make your wrap loop , straighten out the pin , so it falls nicely .you do n't want the loop to be bent or anything .now we have it in the middle .
before you can start painting its important to have your subject matter in mind .i highly recommend using a photograph .what we 're going to do is we 're take this photograph. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to start painting it ,but then we 're going to throw in different elements , change things around , make the alternative version from this .but as you find your photograph you also have to keep in mind the size of your painting .is this the actual size of your painting that you want to have ?or would you rather have a much bigger version , much bigger painting that you 're going to create today .so in this case i 'm looking at creating a bigger painting. [CLS] [SEP]so what i 've done is i 've blown up the original photograph and made a copy of it .i 'm going to be including this near my easel here , kind of for reference .so that i can basically keep in mind kind of the original shapes , sizes and tones of the original portrait .because while i 'm going to change things some of the same , you know , shapes and sizes are still gon na come through .some of the same lines , spaces of the eyes , those types of things .and you also have to keep in mind the blown up picture and the size of the canvas you want to use today .you want to make sure that your canvas size is not going to crowd the picture .that you have plenty of room to express your creativity and not to crunch things .
now we have the lydian in a g scale and what that is going to have is a raised four brought about by its corresponding major relative d where the key signature is f and c. [CLS] [SEP]so instead of having g to g with only one sharp. [CLS] [SEP]you are going to have g to g with two sharps .one thing that is nice about this particular scale is that it has a particular pull towards the five .the sharp four as we discussed before , its position and why it is called a sharp four will pull very nicely up to the five because it is a half step under the five .
alright. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm going to elaborate on triads a little bit .once again a triad is a chord that can be played simultaneously .and a lot of times it 's played as an arpeggio , regardless of how the positions of the notes are on the keyboard or on the guitar for instance , in which there are many literally lovely combinations .but it 's easily c , e , g and a c on top or b flat , d , f and a b flat on top .that sort of thing .played not simultaneously but one by one is what we call the arpeggio .but what 's fun about that is you can play some pretty cool sounding licks .now i 'm a firm believer in playing nice melodies , but. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm also. [CLS] [SEP]a firm believer of throwing some flash in there like guitar players do .because i found that it generates a positive and enthusiastic response from whatever audience. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm playing with .you can even combine these .
you have you split energy here. [CLS] [SEP]like you ’ re pulling something .go back with your back , then your shoulder , then this energy , this is heavy energy , that ’ s roll back .you come from it here , sit , push off with the back foot , sink , step , sink , turn your shoulders turn your hands at the same time , your arms around , sit .this is roll back .
hi , i 'm sarah hauer .sig hauer : and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm sig hauer , and we 're professional practitioners of traditional chinese medicines .sarah hauer : we 're here on behalf of expert village .sig hauer : and welcome to our video .this is a `` zhi gan cao '' which is sliced , honey-fried licorice root .this is used in quite a few formulas because it tends to help lead herbs to all 12 channels .and the other thing , big property that it has , is that it also helps to ameliorate or kind of settle the properties of other herbs so that they do n't come across so strong in a formula , so to speak .a very commonly used herb , i also kind of use this as a remedy for people with sore throat .i 'll tell them just take a piece and chew on it for while .do n't swallow it , but just chew on it for a while , and this soothes a sore throat .
in this video i 'll be talking about how to build a major arpeggio .so let 's start with f. [CLS] [SEP]you remember the major scale ?well remember the scale degrees , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , and one .to build an arpeggio you 're going to play the first , third , fifth and seventh degrees of the scale .so here we are at one , we skip two and play three , skip four play five , skip six and play seven , and hit one .so it should sound like this .this is called a major seven arpeggio .a guitarist or pianist uses these notes and plays them all at once and that would be called a major chord .
i 'm looking for an l shape right here .once i have those two things , i am going to fold my binding back so that this folded edge right here lines up with the raw edge right here .and these three raw edges , one , two , three are all together .once i have that , i am going to insert one more pin right here .i 'm going to make sure that these two folds right here are lined up .i 'm going to fold this down , and this folded edge is now lining up with this raw edge here .i 'm going to take an awl , and i 'm going to feel right here .and by the way , this is a very necessary tool .i 'm going to stitch down until i can feel that fold right underneath there , and then i 'm going to hit reverse on my machine and do just one or two reverse stitches .and then , i 'm going to bring my needle to the highest position so that my thread will move. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to pull out my quilt top just enough that i can flip this dog ear back , make my turn. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to sew right off the edge this time .now , we 're going to pause for just a moment. [CLS] [SEP]and you can see that we have made a nice mitered corner .in our next segment , we will be trimming this off and flipping it to the back and finishing it off .
alvin dedeux :so the next thing you want to do is actually start attaching some of these materials to the hook .and what i 've done is i 've clipped off my materials so that the front end is nice and even .this part is going to be hanging back. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's not really that big of a deal if it 's uneven. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's actually the kinda uneven back. [CLS] [SEP]sometimes is more attractive .it looks a little bit more realistic than if we cut off really blunt thing .now , the trick is to sort of pinch this between your fingers , lay it in position and then wrap your thread around the materials without letting them spin around the hooks .so that when i let go , all my material is right. [CLS] [SEP]where i set it , just right on top of the hook .and then once you do three or four wraps to lock it down , it 's pretty much on there .it 's not going to go anywhere .so that 's --i 'm tying the fly now .that was my first step .attach my materials to the hook .
so now we 've got all these snips on the inside of the pillow to make it lay nice and neat. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're almost ready to flip it out. [CLS] [SEP]but i think before i do i want to go over here and make an anchor stitch right along this edge that i 'm going to want to turn over when i close the pillow .and by doing that it 's going to make , it 's going to basically create a curve that i can follow when i 'm ready to turn it under and top sew it closed .and i 'm going to show you how to do that right now .and so what i 'm going to do i 'm going to turn my stitch length to the biggest stitches i can get .that means i do n't want very many stitches per inch .i only , maybe like five or six stitches per inch .then i 'm also going to loosen up my tension a little bit .and i 'll show you why .make sure you have some extra thread. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm just going to run a real long , light stitch right here .no back stitching or anything .so .and then when you take it out you loosen it up with your hand wheel .then grab it between your finger , your forefinger and your thumb and pull .if you let them pull without grabbing them it will go ahead and pull together. [CLS] [SEP]and you do n't want that .you want to be able to control it .so what you want to do is just barely pull it. [CLS] [SEP]and it gives it like a little , little ruffle .and you 're just running the ruffle along the side of the edge .and what this does when we 're ready to close this pillow this seam just wants to turn over just like that .it helps you a lot when you 're ready to close it .so you 're not trying , fighting this fabric to make it curve when it does n't want to .now we have that and let 's go ahead and flip it out and see how this looks .okay .just push all this out .let 's see the piping how it lays real nice and smooth .that looks really good .and now in the next step we 're going to go ahead and put the pillow insert in .then pin it to be closed. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're almost done .
next you want to check that your lever cap screw and components are tight also .if they are a little bit loose , it would cause the shatter or the jumping of your plane .my next problem is that the wood shavings keep getting clogged up in the mouth of the plane .to fix this problem you would want to take apart your plane and take a look where the frog sits in relation to the throat .now it looks like it is sitting just a little bit to far forward. [CLS] [SEP]and this is going to cause the wood chips to get caught up in there .so what we need to do is set it back a little ways , reassemble our plane and test it again .
and then just smash it like that .all of those huse will come right out of there. [CLS] [SEP]and your going to have a beautiful piece of garlic to go ahead and chop. [CLS] [SEP]so you see it 's ready to go just like that .same thing with the other one go ahead and just smash it down all that will come right off. [CLS] [SEP]just roll right out of there , so then what i like to do is go ahead and make some nice chops like that .gather them together and if there 's any huse. [CLS] [SEP]just push those away and for this again it 's going to be great flavor. [CLS] [SEP]your doing fresh , you can use the stuff in the jar that 's good to. [CLS] [SEP]it 's usually cured in olive oil and that 's good to. [CLS] [SEP]but it does n't have that nice fresh flavor that your going to get with fresh garlic .
we 're going to now incorporate the mambo cha cha .mambo cha cha comes form our latin dances and it looks like ; 1 , 2 , 1 , 2 , 3.it has a rhythm change in it , quick little step to change your lead foot .transferring that to the step , i might start with a basic step .then i 'll say change that to a mambo cha cha .actually , we 'll do mambo cha cha on the floor where we cross , cha cha , cross , cha cha .you can transfer it to the bench .1 , 2 , 3.you can do it straight on .mambo cha cha , or you add more rhythm by doing one mambo and 3 cha chas .it 'll be mambo , cha cha , cha cha , cha cha , which changes your lead foot .once you have it place , you can start to travel around the bench .you have mambo , cha cha , cha cha , and mambo . [CLS] [SEP]1 , 2 , 3.it creates space , creates tensity , creates flare , and dance .then i can just come back to single .mambo cha cha .
alright .it 's not crucial that we center this entire piece of clay , but mentally if it 's somewhat centered your pieces are going to come out a lot nicer .it 's just how it works .if you 've got something all catawampus over here. [CLS] [SEP]it 's going to throw you off mentally .so , go ahead and center it on up .do n't worry about the bottom or cleaning up the bottom like we do with all those other pieces .it does n't matter we 're working from this mound up .alright , so. [CLS] [SEP]we 've got that piece centered and with the sockeye set things are rather small. [CLS] [SEP]so we 're not going to be throwing with a lot of clay .so , bring your ware board over , make sure you 've got your tools , especially this one .then from here we 're going to grab the proper amount of clay. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to start making the cups .
this is a commercial break for negative space .in calligraphy we have to pay a lot of attention to negative space and we actually have to see negative space as positive space .we call our negative spaces counters .here is my favorite example of a perfectly wonderful negative space .it 's the fedex logo .do you see the arrow ?do you see it now ?do you see it now ?do you see it now ?because this arrow is a thing or shape that we recognize it 's a positive space .now , when we do letters we do letters with the idea that what we 're drawing are the counters or the negative spaces .therefore i 'm drawing the inside of the bowl of the r. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm drawing this shape in here .therefore , i can take this brush and i can draw a line like this , which is a black line , and i can draw another line like that , which is a black line , and i 've drawn a third line because i 've drawn that white line .so , there you go negative space .
now you 'll want to decide what type of album you 're going to make .will this be an album of original material , songs that you 've written ?will it be an album of songs that you 've co-written with other people , either band members or friends or people that you would write music with ?or will this be an album of covers , songs that other people have written ?or it can be mix and match .you can have some of all three of those possibilities .now if you 're going to make a cover album , you 're going to need to pay royalties to the people that wrote the song .so you 'll need to make sure that that 's a part of your budget when you 're figuring out how much money you 're going to spend on this project .now especially if you sell a lot of albums or if it 's on radio , you 'll be having to pay royalties each time those songs are performed or aired .now if it 's original material , these will be your songs so you wo n't have to worry about that so much .but there is , obviously , more work involved as far as writing your own songs .so you might want to decide what type of music you 're going to put on the disc , and whether they 'll be original or cover tunes .
normally , i do n't go without makeup .but , i tell you , skin care is such a near and dear subject to my heart that i figured , you know what ?i might as well go bare , and i 'm happy with it .now let 's discuss the difference between my skin , which is female skin , and male skin .now boys and girls differ on different levels .of course , female skin is a little bit different because of our hormones .so , we have a tendency to break out a little bit more , we have a tendency to have a little bit more inflammation .but , on the other side , men tend to have a little bit more sun damage .why ?because they forget to put their sun screen on because it does n't make them feel manly of something .or , they just have other things to do. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's just not in their regimen .so , men definitely need sun screen because when you get older you 're going to have the same sun spots that we 're going to have. [CLS] [SEP]so you want to protect yourself .the other thing is , is that men 's skin are a little bit rougher than ours .which is a little weird , just because they exfoliate more .now , men do n't seem to have the dryness that we have due to the fact of the exfoliation .and , the reason why they exfoliate more is because every time they shave their face , they 're naturally exfoliating .they 're naturally taking the dead skin off .but , again , they do have a tendency to be just a little bit more with the sun damage , which in the same way will still give you the age spots .so guys , again , you want to watch what you 're doing with the spf .you want a good cleanser .there 's so many guys that have break outs .not because their skin is oily , or not because they 're not taking proper time with it , but they 're not using the right cleanser .they grab whatever their girlfriend or boyfriend has , or whatever is on sale , and they do n't pay attention to what they 're doing .so , every guy needs a good cleanser to cleanse off their daily dirt .just like you wash your body in the shower , you want to wash your face .other things you want to do is you want to watch products that have fragrances in it .a lot of colognes have a matching shower gel , have a matching facial balm , and kind of things like that .even though the matching shower gel is great for you , you might want to watch the matching facial balm because it might have an irritant in there that 's not really going to work with your skin .so you want to watch that .other things that guys want to do is you 're going to need some sort of anti-aging product .now , although i might not be able to talk you into a toner , you will need a moisturizer .so , an easier way to get your spf and your moisture is to combine the two products together for the guy .another thing that they really , really , believe it or not , enjoy is a facial .so , maybe if you 're thinking about giving your honey something special , or your brother or your dad .not a lot of guys are going to treat themselves to the spa .so how about doing something nice and send them to the spa .not only will it relax them , but it will be an educational thing for them too .they 'll learn how to take care of their skin properly and healthily .is healthily a word ?hmmm .hey !`` hello . [CLS] [SEP]''what are you doing over there ? `` sleeping . [CLS] [SEP]''i told you , one of the best gifts you can give your guy is a trip to the spa .wake up !hey !wake up !you 've got to teach them more about the spa . [CLS] [SEP]`` awww too bad , i was really enjoying myself in this seat . [CLS] [SEP]''okay .so when we come back we are going to show you what to expect in the spa .for not only you , but for the ones you love .
hi , i 'm masequa myers and we will talk about the sixth day of kwanzaa and the sixth principle of kwanzaa .kuumba .creativity .as the lighter of the candle , i will say , `` kuumba . [CLS] [SEP]''and you will , say , `` kuumba . [CLS] [SEP]''i will say , `` creativity , '' the definition in english , and you will say , `` creativity . [CLS] [SEP]''kuumba , to always do as much as we can in any way that we can to make our communities more beautiful than when we inherited them .kuumba .and in our next clip , we will talk about the seventh day , the last day , of kwanzaa and the seventh principle .
let 's play our a , b harmonic minor scale once again .( demo )now , let 's go over our 6th scale degree , which is g natural .between f sharp , our 5th scale degree and g natural is a half step .it 's played with the third finger on the d string .
hi , i 'm sundae with natural sundae , and i 'm going to show you a way to massage away a stiff neck .i 'm going to give you two of my special moves .now the first thing i like to do , is i like to place a hot pack on the neck of the client , because it 's a really nice way to relax the tissue , and honestly , it makes my job easier .so the hot packs been on a couple minutes .i 'm going to remove it .what i 'm going to do is i 'm just going to start with some nice , relaxing moves .pushing the shoulders down and relaxing them .you 're going to just push them down , you can do this together , or in alternate movements .going over the shoulders and back up to the neck .one more time , down the shoulders and up the neck .now , one of the moves i have is kind of funny ...it's. [CLS] [SEP]..i call the lawnmower , because it emulates the ...the ... [CLS] [SEP]what you do when you pull a lawnmower string .what you 're going to do is , you 're going to take this part of your forearm on this part of the client , right here .let me get some oil , a little bit on my forearm , and you 're going to just gently press and use your body weight all the way down .now , i know this looks like your shoulder , but underneath there is the main culprit when you have a stiff neck .it 's your neck muscle , and it 's called your levator scapula .and it 's used to elevate your scapula .and you actually use this muscle for almost everything .and it 's the muscle that gets sore when you ca n't turn your neck to the side .so you 're going to do your lawnmower .and what you 're going to do is , you 're going to rotate your palm down .you 're going to use this part , right on the thick part ....meaty. [CLS] [SEP]part of their shoulder , and you 're going to go all the way down .you 're going to do this a couple times , rotating that palm down , like you 're pulling a lawnmower string .one more time .go up the neck right there , and then we 're going to repeat this on the other side using this part of your forearm on the meaty part of their shoulder .rotating the palm down .there we go , relaxing the shoulders down , and going up the neck .then my second move will actually ... [CLS] [SEP]really do n't have a name for it , but ....i use my fists , and i put them right here , right in the neck , right in the crevice .and i rotate my fists up the neck and over the shoulders .this is really good for relaxing all the muscles in the neck .you 're kneading and loosening those muscles , as well as the shoulder muscles .you 're coming down over the shoulders , up the neck , and rotating those fists .and those are two really great moves for a stiff neck .i hope you 've learned a little something .i 'm sundae with natural sundae .
the saxophone is a big instrument .the alto sax , there are bigger saxophones , the tenor sax is bigger , but you have got a lot of ground to cover when you are playing the saxophone as far as getting your wind though the horn .it is something that does n't come to you right off the bat .you have to practice , just like , just like anything .it is kind of like lifting weights .when you start out , you are really going to feel it after a while playing the sax .it will make you tired .so breath control and strength of your lungs is real important .it is something that you can build up .do not get frustrated .as you can see , the saxophone is covered with these holes .when you are playing a higher note ( the higher the notes )the fewer holes that are covered .so if i 'm playing , for example , a high b ; the air only has to go down to the b key before it comes out of the saxophone .and that is where the sound is created .it is right where the bottom key that you are holding down is actually down .so as i go all the way down the saxophone , down to the bottom keys .this low b flat , which is the lowest note the saxophone , can play .you are going to really have to blow to get down there .it is important to fill the saxophone up .the breath control part comes in where you are not actually playing very loud , but you are playing strong .you have to push the air all the way down through the saxophone without blowing everybody 's ears out in the room .so here is a little example of how much wind you have to put through to get down that low .it takes a lot of wind .try not to blow everybody 's ears out , obviously , when you get down that low .it just takes practice , do not get frustrated .it will make you tired .pick it back up again and just keep at it .your lungs will get strong over time .
and you have a ball band inside .it actually spins right around when you flick it .and this is what the string actually goes around .so when you put your string on like i showed you in the last segment , it actually goes right around the band like so .so when you are playing with a yo-yo , it is actually spinning around the band itself which creates less friction and allows them to spin as long as they are spinning .so we will put these back together .what happens is you will notice when you are playing with it and trying to wind it back up , because there is a ball bearing here , when you move this it is not grabbing onto anything .it just continues to move around .what you need to do is actually put one finger into the gap , go around that finger once , come underneath it and skip it .do this two , sometimes three times .my ears are a little wider. [CLS] [SEP]so it needs to be a little more .you drop that loop in there and just slightly finish rolling it up and you may think that knot will stop the yo-yo when it is coming out .when you throw it , it will start spinning right away and it will go straight and that is how to wind the yo-yo .
so the best thing to start with is just a measurement of the doll .she is 18 inches long. [CLS] [SEP]so we want to make sure that this the sleeping bag is approximately 18 long to give her room .we need to add a little bit for seam allowances .so we would do 20 inches long .set here aside and measure out our fabric .so we would have a little bit of room to spare .this width is about the width that we would need it , it is 13 inches .so we would plan to make the bag 21x13 inches .that should give up plenty of room for the little doll to fit right inside .that is how we determined our measurements for our bag .
as you continue to relax , close your eyes , focus on your hands .how do they feel ?are they cool ?are they warm ?take another deep breath in , hold it and let it out , relax .on our next segment we will begin visualizing warming our hands .
so let ’ s make sure we know how to play five card draw .just so we 're all on the same playing field .if you will .first there 's an ante at my house the antes one red chip. [CLS] [SEP]and there you go. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 're playing two player .i deal five cards to you and five cards to me. [CLS] [SEP]and then we each look at our hands and access them .sense. [CLS] [SEP]i was the dealer the action is on you .you have the option to check or bet .let ’. [CLS] [SEP]s say you like your hand it does have a pair of tens. [CLS] [SEP]and you bet .you say two red chips. [CLS] [SEP]and i look at my hand .i have a hand i can play with .you 'll see it later .i call you select the number of cards that you want to draw .you tell me it 's three. [CLS] [SEP]i give you three cards .i 'm going to take three myself .three cards for me there 's another betting round .you can also check .you check i check time for the showdown .we read them and weep .you show your pair of tens .i show a ace high which means i am going to throw it in the muck. [CLS] [SEP]and you win the pot .that 's five card draw .
but i 'm just going to use a couple here and make it easy .what you do is kind of roll this into a little cigar lengthwise .what you want to do is stack all of your leaves just like that. [CLS] [SEP]so you made this little tube and it is just really easy .the french call. [CLS] [SEP]it chiffonade. [CLS] [SEP]you just cut this into just across .you know you go across just like this. [CLS] [SEP]and you are going to come out with nice little actually sort of little strains of basil that is going to go into your recipe .
alright now i 'd like to show you some ways to handle the puck .uh you always want to secure it uh protect it , and just for the reason that somebody could get it off your , someone from the opposite team could steal it , it ?s a good way to just protect it , cupping it .keeping it , keeping it with you at all times .stick handling is always very important , just cupping it on the blade and on the back side .you want to treat it an egg , very soft and gently you can move quick , go backwards , you can go forward , go sideways .
i 'm going to show you another way that you can add videos into itunes .this is kind of the simplest way , so let 's launch itunes. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'll show you .so all we 're going to do is find this video file that we have on the desktop , it 's called short area film web .we 're going to select it and drag it over to our itunes library .you can see on the top of the screen that it 's copying one of one , short area film web , and as soon as it 's complete we can take a look at it .now that it 's done copying we can go into our movies folder , and we 'll see here. [CLS] [SEP], we 've got the short area film web , and to view it we just double click , and there it is .if you want to exit out of this view mode , there 's a little x that 'll appear in your top lefthand corner , so if you click on that , it 'll close it and bring you back to your library file .well now that you 've tested your video you can see that you successfully imported it , and you now know how to use the drag and drop method for adding files into itunes .it 's pretty much the simplest method because all you have to do is find your video file , drag it into itunes , and let it copy .so that 's how you add a video to itunes .
hello , this is jb .i 'm with austin homebrew supply in austin , texas , and we are discussing different equipment associated with fermenting beer or wine .specifically , right now i 'm going to talk a little bit about air locks .air locks are a piece of equipment utilized in brewing that allows co2 gas to escape during the fermentation process , but does not allow any other contaminents in the atmosphere in general to get in to the fermentation vessel .big thing about brewing. [CLS] [SEP]is. [CLS] [SEP]you need to control the amount of contamination that happens to it .so , almost every beer ever made and every wine ever made. [CLS] [SEP]has a particular amount of contamination , but we 're trying to minimize it .so , the idea is to take a vessel , a fermentation vessel such as this , make your beer or wine , but it in to it , inoculate it with your yeast , and then put your air lock on to it , such as we have here .now , this particular kind of air lock is called a three piece air lock , and this is our most popular seller .it goes for about a dollar twenty , i believe .three pieces are the body , the bell , and then the lid .so , the way that you would use it is you would make your beer or wine , put it in to your fermentation vessel .once you get your yeast in to it. [CLS] [SEP]and you snap your lid down , then you 're going to take the three piece air lock , pour a little bit of either water or sanitizing solution in to it to bring it just below this line , about a third full .snap that lid down and then put it on to the fermenter like we have here .so , that 's a little bit about how a three piece air lock works .
there are so many different types .they can do so many different things in the garden .it is a very versatile genus of plants .my border up here in the front. [CLS] [SEP]i use three different types .they are three of the basic ones that you see an awful lot of so we will review them .the first one that come into bloom is the german iris , the bearded iris and. [CLS] [SEP]you can see why people call it a bearded iris because it has this frill in here , the beard .the other two parts of the iris flower are the standards the part that stands up right here and in this case , sort of a lilac color and the valves the purple part that you see here the beard sits in .one of my favorite iris 's is this one here .this is a siberian iris .this is caesar 's brother .now we can see on the siberian iris we still have standards , we still have valves but not beard .it is one of the things that sets it apart .the other thing that sets it apart from the bearded iris is this grassy like foliage which is much more upright narrow compared to the wide fan shaped blades of the german iris .both of these guys come into color and sequence very nicely from the german which is just on its way out to siberian who is just on his way in .probably another month down the road here. [CLS] [SEP]we will get to the japanese iris .this is probably my favorite .japanese iris does famously in a garden border situation like this. [CLS] [SEP]but it will do just as well in the edge of a pond or water feature .the other nice thing about it is it is even a bigger bloom than the siberian iris .
in this clip i want to talk to you about jumping your motor cross bike .jumping , obviously , the most fun part of motor cross bike or it can be as long as you do it right .the main part is really staying neutral on your bike .get up on your bike .you go into the jump ,which i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]sure you 've already went around the track .you know , you really want to go around the track , learn your lips of your jumps , because there 's a lot different. [CLS] [SEP], you know , some jumps are kind of more angled where you 'll just launch off of them and. [CLS] [SEP]kind of more for distance , some jumps are a lot lippier .so , you want to really pay attention to what kind of lips you 're going to be hitting on your bike most of all , so stay in neutral .squeezing your knees , can not express it enough about squeezing your knees , because wherever your bike is squeezing your knees and your head is pointed straight your bike will follow .so , you 're going to go up .you 're coming up to the jump face kind of nice and neutral .when i say neutral. [CLS] [SEP]i mean you 're not too far back. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're not too far forward .you 're in a nice neutral spot on your bike .so , when you get up to the jump face what 's going to happen is your bike , your suspension is going to compress into the face .as that compresses into the face you 're going to feel it .then right when you 're going to , just when you 're leaving the lip it 's going to tend to , it 's going to. [CLS] [SEP], you 're. [CLS] [SEP]folley is going to , it 's going to become uncompressed. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to shoot you up into the air .that 's really when you want to feel out your body and get it ; get it correctly right in the middle of your bike .so , you 're kind of ; let 's say you 're starting to go a little further back .if you 're right in the middle of your bike just move your body up a little bit .move your body up .it neutralizes the bike , gets you that balance .let 's say you 're kind of already. [CLS] [SEP]; you hit the lip of the jump and you 're coming forward on it .well , move that body back .also a nice rule of thumb to do on your bike is when you 're on your bike ; if you start to endo a little bit , endo is when your front wheel is low , you give your bike a ton of gas , as much gas it is .it 's what we call the panic rev .not really something you want to hear or something you want to do , but it happens a lot .what that will do is get your ; get your rear wheel rotating enough with enough mass and. [CLS] [SEP]it 'll ; it 'll try to ; the gravity kind of pulls it back down to the ground .say if you start to kind of come back and your front wheel is really high .it 's what we call looping out .then you 're going to want ; then you 're going to want to grab on your clutch and hit your rear break .what that 's going to do is it 's going to stop your rear wheel from rotating and. [CLS] [SEP]kind of naturally it 's going to put your bike and want to ; want to slap your front wheel down .definitely techniques that are good to use , but you definitely want to have enough practice when you use them .
calab labarda :all right .so next , we 're going to be putting our nunchucks together for double the power and double the strikes. [CLS] [SEP], okay ?so instead of moving them as two separate units , we 're going to put them together and use them as one unit ,all right ?so mostly , your form will look like l 's .you 're going to split up .but now , we 're going to bring them together and do strikes .one , two .see , back and forth , come across , helicopters or both of them ,all right ?and let 's go. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'll show you a great way to go into that .so a good way to do it is starting of with your l 's. [CLS] [SEP], okay ?showing you your nice basic l-strikes , get them up from here .now , you should know how to do a switch-up with one nunchuck reaching under and pulling. [CLS] [SEP], okay ?so i 'm going to do that. [CLS] [SEP], watch .it 's going to be a really cool trick if you do it. [CLS] [SEP], right ?it will look really neat .you 're going to come underneath , catch , with one hand grab it. [CLS] [SEP]and now it 's completely gone .it 's in my left hand .now , i 'm going to swing .i 'm going to put it back , grab my nunchucks together , one , two , three , four and five. [CLS] [SEP], okay ?so one more time , go to your l 's .bam .okay ?l-strikes , these are all strikes .two , okay ?from here , i 'm going to go up , catch ,let go .now , all i 'm going to do is bring my hand back around , grabbing my nunchuck , swinging , one .do the strikes , strike , helicopter spin around the head , over , strike. [CLS] [SEP], come back around , strike ,okay ?now , i 'm going to go to my three-hit combo that we learned .one , two , three , all right ?one more time , from here -- or you do n't even have to do off the switches .you can just do it from here .you can do your thing .it looks cool moving back a little bit go on one foot , back here , one , two , three , four , helicopter spin with both of them around , three-hit combo .bam .all right ?and that is going to be doubling up your strikes with both your nunchucks , pointing them together in the same motion .
i 'm going to talk to you about how to use a carpet steam cleaner .now the first thing you want to do before you steam clean any carpet. [CLS] [SEP]is you want to make sure that the area is vacuumed very well .in some cases you might even want to go over it a couple of times .a good thorough vacuuming is very important before you start to steam clean a carpet .the next thing is that there are several models of steam cleaners that you can use at home , there are several types that you can rent .the most important thing is to make sure that you load the detergent in the system that is designed for that particular steam cleaner .ok so you do n't want to mix and match. [CLS] [SEP]or you do n't want to use a detergent for cleaning your carpets that is n't particularly designed for steam cleaning .the next thing we 'll do is that you 'll want to fill your reservoir in this case , this has an upper chamber that you can go and just fill it with hot tap water .in most cases , hot tap water will be sufficient for using your steam cleaning .you want to make sure that as you fill this up that you fill it up to the line that is indicated here .so with your steam cleaning one thing is very important is that as you start you want to , you can move it forward to spray some heavily soiled areas but. [CLS] [SEP]in most cases what you want to do when you are steam cleaning is as you are depressing the detergent button that you want to be pulling the stream cleaner slowly and steadily towards you .ok and in this case you are not really using vigorous strokes like you may in a vacuum cleaner you are using slow , steady .and then you want to go back. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to continue to work this in parallel so as you are depressing the button. [CLS] [SEP]then move in a slow , slow method .what this will allow , the slow steady movement in parallel strokes will make sure that you get a complete clean but it will also make sure that you do n't saturate too much of your steam cleaning solution into that .and then also a lot of your steam cleaners will have a rinse mode. [CLS] [SEP]so you can go back and actually rinse and not leave detergent .and then from that you can simply let your carpet dry , and in some cases depending on what type detergent , what type of system you are using it may recommend that you vacuum it again to remove any of your detergent residue .so i 'm tim gipson and that 's how to steam clean a carpet .

now , the way we do the functional training is to put ourselves , put our bodies into situations that more , again , accurately reflect the activities that we 're going to be pursuing .the type of equipment that i have here that we use is the kinesis system from technogym , and it allows freedom of movement .it allows me to define the movement so that i can create exercises that will prepare people for particular activities .one -- some of the things that it helps with are better balance , more flexibility , muscular endurance , strength , and just general coordination , because it integrates muscle groups rather than isolating them , as i was talking about before .it makes the muscle groups work together as they do in everyday life .balance is one -- is of critical importance for us all. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's difficult to train for balance unless you put yourself in a situation where you 're out of balance and. [CLS] [SEP]your body learns how to compensate for it .if i tell you to exercise the muscles that are going to keep you from tipping over this way , what are you going to do ?what you 're going to do is you 're going to put yourself in a position where there is some reason for you perhaps to do that. [CLS] [SEP]and you make your body adjust to keep that from happening , and you exercise those muscles and become much more aware of how your body works and where it is in space .this equipment , the technogym equipment , the kinesis line , will do that automatically in addition to many of the other things .i 'm going to go through a series of exercises with the system so that you can see how it works .now , each one of these stations , there four stations in this unit : the alpha , the beta , the gamma , and the delta station .we 'll be demonstrating some exercises with each of those stations .each one , each exercise has an upper body and a lower body component .the lower body components are consistent , and there are a series of them .the upper body will vary depending on what station we 're using and each of the stations have movements in different planes , so that you can create different exercises to cover all possible movements that we can make .
you want to decide whether you have a high , medium , or low light situation .you need to choose a location in your office or home where you need plant , you need to determine whether it is high , low , or medium light .is it close to a north , an east , a south , or a west facing window .or if you have any internal lighting , such as florescent lighting that may or may not help your situation .if you are in the north or east facing light , you might find that it would be considered a low to medium light area .and you need to choose your plants accordingly .now if your , for lack of a better example , it want to move around real quick .facing south as in our store here , you would be in a high light situation .you want to make sure that you choose a plant or find somebody to help you choose a plant that would be referred to as a high light plant .just real quick , i can show you our , such as ficus trees , a very general plant .high light plants .you want to make sure that if you choose a tree like this and you want it to look good , as it does now , then you put in the correct lighting .it is a high light plant .you want to make sure it 's in a high light situation , such as in a high light facing window .on the alternative , if you have none of that kind of light or your in a north or east facing light .you want to make sure you 're choosing plants that are low light oriented .make sure for one ; you 're talking to somebody who knows .but you 're also looking at plants that are either labeled if you do n't know as a low or medium light plant .again getting back to adenomas and other plants such as cast irons and snake plants here showing behind the screen .these will help you find that , well they 're not going to help you find , but you 're going to find that there. [CLS] [SEP]great low light plants and. [CLS] [SEP]you would do better in a low light or no light situations .
hi , my name is derek tarnow .i 've been playing guitar for twelve years , and i teach and perform .in this segment i 'm going to discuss basic guitar chords .first , we have to define what a basic guitar chord is .i tend to think of them as being easy , something you teach a , like , a complete beginner in maybe the first or second lesson .and , something that 's relatively common .so , the most basic guitar chords are like three string chords .which is generally what you 'd start a very young beginner on .like an elementary age student , a late elementary age student , to like , maybe a young girl , middle school student .depending on just how their , their muscles develop .because a lot of times if you 're , like a younger student. [CLS] [SEP], you know , you 're , it 's , it 's really difficult for you to reach your , all your fingers , all the way around the neck of the guitar , and to have any kind of control over what your hand 's doing there .but anyway , the first chord that a , usually a student will learn , is c.so , to play that , just with the three , three notes , it 's the top three notes of the guitar .so this is a g , this is a c , it 's played on the b string , and this is an e. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's a very beginning way to play a c.the next chord will be g.so , this is just a g and a b , and another g.so , you might notice that there 's only two different notes on that chord , whereas the c , there are three .and , that 's because it 's not a complete chord .we 're leaving out what 's known as a fifth of the chord .but , if you stick with guitar , past basic guitar chords , you 'll learn more , what that means .the , the first major hurdle for a student to get over , when they 're learning how to play a guitar , is learning to switch chords and time .and , this is really difficult ,because you 're , you 're doing a lot of things at once .you have your right hand strumming , and playing the time .you have your left hand , switching between all six strings and time , too .and , the timing is n't , you know , you know , just exact .there 's a little bit of feel that you have to develop , to learn how to do .well , a good way to start developing these skills is to start with the really easy chords ,like i just showed you , the c and the g.so , you 'd play like , and that 's like , not something that 's terribly difficult to do .the next step , after that , are , or you can start with a step if you 're a little bit older student , or just get the knack of it , or you know , people , people learn at different speeds .if you already have some guitar experience , and you 're just trying to learn guitar chords , this might be a better place for you to start .playing the c like this .and then when you play the c , you do n't play the low e string. [CLS] [SEP], you just play the c note , which is the third fret of the a string .which is also the , written out as middle c on guitar .and you just would strum all five strings of that .and then you 'd switch to g this way .and , on the g chord you play all six strings .and then , you could learn how to switch strings .some other basic guitar chords are e , just played with all six strings .a , just played with only the top five strings .the d , which is only with all the top four strings .some other basic chords are , a minor , e minor , and some not so basic chords , but still , still basic with the d minor .just played with the top four strings , and f , which is probably the most difficult of the basic guitar chords .any way , with time and a little bit of practice and effort , you 'll be able to learn basic guitar chords .and , just stick with it. [CLS] [SEP], do n't let it get too frustrating .
ok.the drink we 're about to make is called a furlong too late .evidently someone was racing horses and did n't quite make it. [CLS] [SEP]so they decided to come up with this drink .so we 're going to do one shot of light rum .and we 're not going to pour it in a glass of ice actually .not sure why i did that , but do n't worry .every things going to be ok.one shot .and we 're going to do it the rest , about four ounces of a ginger beer .make sure that is in fact a ginger beer .so , let 's go ahead and mix that up a little bit here .get the rum and the ginger beer together .and take a lemon .get the peel .and give it a little twist in there .and drop that in .and lets get a glass .and enjoy a furlong too late .there we go .bottoms up .
you are already in an apartment lease and when you come home from work one night you notice there 's a huge hole in the ceiling and the hole is larger. [CLS] [SEP]then the last time you reported it to your landlord .and apparently they are not going to do anything about it .hello. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm robert todd. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm here to answer the questions how to sue your landlord to resolve a landlord tenant dispute .well one of the first things you want to consider is what does your lease agreement with this landlord say .they may very well be a provision in the lease agreement itself that dictates whether you can sue the landlord or whether you have to do something before you can sue the landlord such as go through a dispute resolution process or something of that nature .you also want to take a look at the statutes of the state in which your reside that would govern over landlord tenant disputes .and you want to determine whether this is a residential landlord tenant dispute or a commercial landlord tenant dispute because ordinarily even though it varies from state to state the requirements for suing a landlord are different if it 's a commercial landlord tenant dispute. [CLS] [SEP]then they are if it 's a residential landlord tenant dispute .i 'm robert todd and thank you for watching .
now we 're going to prep our board for our hand mirror .i 've had it cut with a jigsaw into the pattern that we made .and you want to decide which side is going to be the front of your mirror .and which is going to be the back .and on the back we want to round the sharp edges all around .so you take your eighty grit sand paper and we 'll fold it just to make it a little bit stiffer to work with and go all the way around the project in between the fingers and just round off the edge .only on the back of the project .go all the way around and then you 'll want to finish sand it with the one eighty grit paper to make it smooth .this side , the back side is going to be the painted side of this project .and the front side will be the mosaic side .okay. [CLS] [SEP]after you 've gotten all the rough edges off the side , you 've taken that sharp bit off the edge , you want to just finish off with the one eighty grit paper to smooth it off for a nice finish that we can paint over .
so a transition from a side kick with left heel into jaded maiden works shells .so the left foot retracts slightly and then comes out as right hand comes underneath the left .weight transfers from the right to left .bringing the left toe in , the hands turn over withdraw the right leg back into a left empty stance .hands circle outwards , pulling up at the right knee .you actually jump up into the air and turn the hands over .again , hands picking up , palms facing up , shifting on the left foot .drawing the right hip in , kicking with the right foot .now , jumping forward on to the right heel , land , leap forward with left , and right hand drawing back left hand draws forward .
sometimes , again , there 's different ways that you can actually fix something .if the mistake is really , really blatant , and you just ca n't live with it , and it 's kind of off to the side , you can always do what i 've done here with this piece .there was another part , and i just cropped the image , and turned it into a different image from when it started .but the mistake was gone , and it does n't irritate me nearly as much when i look at it now as it did before .and now i can go on and finish this piece , and i will be happy with it .we talked earlier about the gold and silver leaf ...excellent for covering errors .i ... [CLS] [SEP].i have a piece where i ...i do n't know where i was and what i was thinking , but i completely destroyed the background .it was nothing that i wanted .so i simply went in and laid some white gold leaf and some copper leaf , and that actually did some wonderful things with the background , turned it into a completely different piece , and everyone was very happy with it .so , again , if you 've studied enough of your materials , you 've experimented , you 've played around enough. [CLS] [SEP], there 's not much that can go wrong that you ca n't fix .
in this segment we 're going to cover rotating the engine 180 degrees and that takes us from cylinder number one to top dead center on cylinder number three .so i 'm going to insert my extension and ratchet and just slowly just rotated the engine over a 180 degrees and remembering or keeping in mind .that the crank shaft turns at twice the rate of the cam shaft .so if i 'm rotating a cam shaft a 180 degrees. [CLS] [SEP]the upper cam sprockets will only rotate 90 degrees. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm having a little difficulty getting past compression stroke .there it goes !once again if that 's a little difficult for you .you can remove the spark plugs and the engine wo n't develop any compression .makes it easier to turn over .now the position if the up marks to verify your on cylinder number three .should be on the exhaust side at this time .with your center marks lined up evenly and that will conclude rotating the engine 180 degrees .please watch our next segment on adjusting the intake valves .cylinder number three part one .
some of the key features are the things that you should be looking for when buying an innerspring mattress is is to make sure you 're getting the state of the art coil system .the state of art coil system in my opinion is the individually wrap coil , and you can see that right here .it 's pocketed design .each coil is pocketed individually .and so it 's hinged , or tied together , in the middle so that the coil system 's able to contour a lot better .and how that benefits. [CLS] [SEP]you is. [CLS] [SEP]it 's contouring to your body relieving alleviating pressure points better .and also you 're not going to feel the movement of you partner as much .the the second most important thing is is what type of filling materials they 're using on top of the bed .my personal preference are most people 's personal preference are the best quality materials you can use is the latex foam rubber .and that 's going to last a long time .the more you , they 're using the better off. [CLS] [SEP]you 're going to be .and that sits right on top of the mattress on these individually wrap coils .and what happens there , it 's able to even alleviate more pressure points in your body by giving you adequate support .
when tacking up the horse , we 'll begin by putting the saddle pad on .then we 'll take the back pad , put that on .then the saddle and we 're attaching the girth .once the saddle 's on , move on to the bridle .and we 're going to first put the reins over the horse 's head .take the halter off .bring the bit up and in and bring it over the ears .and then we 're going to attach the nose band and this should be snug. [CLS] [SEP]and then the flash nose band and the throw latch .
but the next thing we need to do is take care of the bottom edges .the bottom has not yet been hemmed so we would take care of that now .by turning over just a small amount from the bottom .turning up about a 1/4 of inch and then rolling up another 1/4 of a inch and making a shirt tail hem .i would start at the seam and sew just along the edge .we could have put a contrasting piece of fabric along the bottom .we could of closed this with a zipper , it could be closed with velcro .but with velcro my concern is stagging some of the garments that would be going inside the garment bag .so i prefer to just close it with just a ribboned tied at the bottom as much with decoration with anything else .i would continue hemming the bottom edges and then we would sew on the the trim .that would be our last step in our garment bag .
if you take your arms out right here , and you just push back , you 're going to stretch through your biceps .now , i 'm feeling this a little bit .if you really want to feel a bicep stretch , do it after you work biceps hard , when you pump blood into the muscles .you 'll really feel it .okay .very simple , also here , notice from the side and from here .this is also going to stretch through your forearms as well underneath , but , it 's also a bicep stretch ,okay .really simple .tricep , which is the back of your arm , you 've seen this ,when i 'm.

[CLS] [SEP]and i 'm not pulling too hard , just a gentle stretch on both sides .you 'll feel this , it 's a good stretch .and one more for shoulder .i think i showed you in the chest that you can grab a hold of the bar behind you and open up .take both arms back behind you , lift your hands behind you a little bit .so from here , i come up here .and from the shoulder as well , if i reach across on both sides , this is what it looks like from the side and from the front .it 's a good shoulder stretch as well .very basic exercises , throw them in and even if you want to right after a really hard training or at the end of your workout .
hi , i 'm jan kain and the last in our chi gong series has to do with re-balancing energy .so , just as we did before we began our practice with warm up and grounding and breathing , we 're going to finish with re-balancing energy .this can be done at the end of your practice or also anytime as a stand alone exercise if you 'd like to cultivate some energy and some relaxation .so here 's how we 're going to do that .you can also do this standing or sitting , does n't really matter too much .if you 're standing your knees are soft , your abs are tight , just like we 've done throughout the series .females are going to go ahead and place the left hand over the right , and the gentlemen are going to go ahead and place right over left .this is what we call the dan tien and the chinese. [CLS] [SEP]feel that this is where your energy center lies .so , from here , we 're just going to talk about moving a little bit of energy .moving around , re-balancing and re-grounding .again , if you 're standing , your feet are rooted to the floor , shoulders are rolled down the back , abs are nice and tight and strong , and your spine is always long .think about roots from the bottoms of your feet connecting with the earth and all that earth energy moving up your spine .again , you 're going to be breathing nice and deep .in through the nose and out through the nose and mouth , exactly as we did in the warm up .so , again , breathing in and breathing out .this is another exercise you can do by itself whenever you need to calm and relax .breathe , inhaling in through the nose , exhaling out through the nose and mouth .and again , inhaling and exhaling .make sure you 're feeling contact with the earth , contact with your energy in your spine , and contact with your breath .so i hope you enjoyed this chi gong series and learned a lot about yourself and about your body .
do you have some of these in your house ?it 's a shame for them to go to waste because they 're so handy ,just the right shape to put a little present inside , like a little lipstick. [CLS] [SEP], maybe some earrings .now , i would n't save a bunch of these and use them for your corporate christmas gifts or anything like that , but for a family member or a friend , toilet paper roll , totally works .i 'm going to use a magazine ad for this one. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to use the toilet paper roll to measure what i want .using my scrapbook paper trimmer , you can use a ruler and a scissor , of course , give that a little slice there .and that , you can see that when i roll this up , i 'm going to really see those eyes .is n't that fun ?it 's a good way to wrap a present for my sister , now that i 'm thinking about it .she 's got sparkle plenty eyes .i 'm going to fold this piece of tissue in half and cut along the fold so that i have an open end on both sides .i do n't want to have just a folded end on one side .and i 'm going to roll the toilet paper roll in this. [CLS] [SEP]and , you know , if you have something larger , like a poster , to give , you can use the same technique using different , you know , larger piece of paper with a poster or mailing tube .you know a poster tube or a mailing tube .this same technique can be translated to any cylindrical shape .you can even wrap a vase or something like that in a circle of cardboard to make your own tube that 's custom fit to match the item that you 're wrapping .a little bit of tape will hold this in place for us and then we can add our magazine .now we want to carefully select the end to roll so that we have the part that we want showing .this is kind of looking like , a little bit like an english christmas cracker , back from. [CLS] [SEP], i do n't know , maybe you could make your own christmas crackers , that would be fun .i love the way this looks so far , but it just needs a little extra something. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to use some black ribbon .i 'm going to use curling ribbon , but this would also look really cute with a skinny , like a three sixteen inch or maybe a little bit wider grosgrain ribbon or a little bit of satin ribbon would be so pretty .i could also , instead of using black , match the color of her eyes , or some other color that coordinates with the wrap that we 've chosen , or matches the tissue .i could also use a little bit of ribbon and then tie some serpentine on there if you wanted to give it as a going away present , sort of a bon voyage look .and now we 're just going to tie these ends and just pull it slowly. [CLS] [SEP]so it has a chance to gather , we do n't want it to be kind of all wadded in one direction .i 'm going to give it a second knot , sure that will make it harder to unwrap , but that 's not your problem. [CLS] [SEP]is it ?okay , nice and tight ,a quick curl. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to do a nice , big , loose curl on this. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're just going to pretend like we remembered to put the present inside .okay , this is ready .is n't that cute ?i know this will really impress your friends .i hope you 've enjoyed these new ideas on how to use things that you 've had laying around your house feeling useless all this time .you 'll see your recycling bin a whole new way. [CLS] [SEP]and you can pretend like they 're your ideas , you do n't have to tell them that i told you .but i 've enjoyed this time together. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm amy snively , be sure to look for my other clips with other tips .
most teams now a days utilize some type of four defensive linemen .so we 've got two tackles and two defensive ends .so there is four of your defensive fenders right there .the dime package means that they are going to have six defensive backs .well you 've got four defensive linemen , and you 've got four defensive backs. [CLS] [SEP], that leaves you one line backer right here .what you need to have done is to take another or extra line backer and put him out into a coverage position , or you have taken him off the field completely and you add another defensive back , a pure defensive back .either a safety or a quarterback .
located in salt lake city , utah .we are here talking about how to use microsoft windows .now i want to talk to you about how to check the amount of memory that your computer has .there 's a couple of ways to do this .i 'm going to show you both .let me start off by saying that windows xp is a registered trademark of microsoft. [CLS] [SEP]and i am in no way affiliated with microsoft .ok a couple of ways to check the amount of memory that your computer has .first thing you want to do is scroll over here and open your start menu .if you go to my computer over here on your right hand side. [CLS] [SEP]and you left click on my computer , it will give you a couple of options .the easiest way is to scroll up here , see control panel , share documents , documents , my network , change the settings , add or remove programs , ding ding , view system information .left click on that , this will ring up your system properties .now if you scroll down on here , right down here , this will show you exactly how much memory you are running on your computer .this says you have two gigabytes of ram on this computer. [CLS] [SEP], that is to me a little slow but this computer has been a great computer .i have n't had any problems with it. [CLS] [SEP]but this shows you the all the information about your system .what kind of computer it is , what you are running , how much memory you have , that to me is the easiest way to access this .another way to access it is by coming over here to your , or actually lets close down the computer screen .the best , another way to do it is to go to the start menu , come up to. [CLS] [SEP]where it says my computer and instead of opening it this time just right click on it , scroll down to properties , it will bring up the properties , there you go .again the same exact screen that shows us right here , how much memory we have on the computer .now to check out individual memory , like to see how much each program happens to be running , there 's a couple of ways we can do this .you can hit control , alt , delete , which brings up your windows task manager .this will allow you to show the applications that you are currently running .this will show you all of your processes that are running and on the right hand side right here , will show you the memory that is in usage from all these different programs .i guarantee you. [CLS] [SEP]there 's at least five or six or ten maybe programs on here that are running that i do n't need running but guess what , i do n't ever deal with this .it does n't take up enough memory for me to even bother with it , but you can see each one of these takes up a certain percentage of memory. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's out of your total ram that you have on your computer .there 's another way to bring up your task manager which i 'm going to show you right now .the best , another way to do this , is to scroll down here to your actual task bar which is this bar right here along the bottom .and it shows all of your programs your start menu , over here it 's got our quick , quick buttons. [CLS] [SEP], what you want to do , is on this task bar you want to right click with your mouse and right here it gives you an option for task manager .that 's the same thing we did with the control , alt , delete , but this is just the way to do it with the mouse .that will bring up the exact same window , the exact same tabs up here that you can choose from .it shows your processes , it shows you exactly which programs and what files are running in the background. [CLS] [SEP]and it shows how much memory that is , that they are using .again it will show also your applications , what applications are currently running .this gives you a lot of information , it will show your performance , it will give you under the performance , it will talk to you about the different memories that are being used and how much .so you can kind of tell how much of your systems memories are being used out of that two gigabytes that we saw earlier .
this harmonics happen actually at the fifth , seventh , ninth and 12th strings .and certain songs have used that with their picking styles .you can add those into your chords or you can use them individually .as you improvise and find your way around , you 'll work those into songs all over the place .neil young did it all the time .so just barely touch the string and pluck it .
i live in san francisco , california .i 'm a sponsored skateboarder. [CLS] [SEP]and i run a program for youth called sf skate club .what i 'm going to show you today is how to do a smith grind on a skateboard .now to do a smith grind , what you have to do is first find an obstacle that can grind .and what you 're going to want to do is be able to ollie higher than whatever you 're trying to do a smith grind on .because to do a smith grind you actually have to ollie above the obstacle and then land in your smith grinds , grind it and then pop out .so once you 've found the right spot that 's going to work for you , like this rail will work , you ride up to the spot or the ledge front side , that means that the ledge or obstacle is on the side that you can see , its on your facing side , then you 're going to want to ollie above the obstacle , land in this position like here with your truck locked in there and then sliding on the corner of the obstacle .so its almost like you 're doing a grind and a board slide at the same time .now once you 've ollied into this position , the way to hold a smith grind is to extend your front leg straight and then bend your back knee to lock into this position .you 're going to focus most of your weight above the back two sets of wheels or the back truck .now when you ollie into it , picture yourself sticking out the front leg and bending your back foot to hold it on there .another tip is to put the tip of your toe on your tail .now what this does is during the grind it helps you get back out because the further on the end. [CLS] [SEP]it is , the easier it is to push it and pop it out .if your foot is here you may find that you get locked if you ca n't put the weight on it .another thing you want to remember when smith grinding is that you 're going to have to lean back a lot. [CLS] [SEP]and this is going to help you lean back and poke that trick forward and ride it through .and that 's how you do a smith grind .my name is shawn connolly , i 'm from san francisco , california and i. [CLS] [SEP]'m a sponsored skateboarder. [CLS] [SEP]and i also run a program called sf skate club for youth at sfskateclub.com .
so first we want to start by prepping the skin .we 're going to first cleanse , just with a daily face wipe to get rid of any dry dull skin .and next we 're going to add vitamins to help nourish the skin .vitamins a , c and e , help increase cell turnover.

[CLS] [SEP]and then you want to add a moisturizer .a lightweight oil-free moisturizer will work well .if you moisturize the skin , the foundation 's going to apply more evenly and smoothly .i also like to use a foundation primer .a foundation primer has silica in it , which is going to help even out the skin surface , allowing your foundation to apply very even and smooth again .it also helps control oil and shine , so if you have oily skin , it 's going to help your foundation last a little bit longer throughout the day .so go ahead and feel your skin and just feel how silky smooth your skin is now .good .so our skin 's prepped for our foundation .

so , here is an example of our country song we wrote called `` houston '' .the verse , the pre-chorus , chorus and bridge of that song .[ start song ] `` in texas weather 's kinda lonesome , changin ' sky blue and gray .and though my friends seem to surround me , i find myself driving away .though i might never meet an angel , i do n't feel i 'll have to try .'cause in my mind she 's simply perfect and i will always be wishing. [CLS] [SEP]i could see a different texas sky .'cause my heart still drives to houston .girl , it 's gone so far away .and my hope is for the future , as i live for one more day .and i ca n't seem to remind myself , life is not about a chance .and i ca n't help but feel between my sight and sense .'cause , girl beneath the southern stars , all i wanted was for one more chance to dance . [CLS] [SEP]''[ end song ]and there you go .that 's how you write a country song .so , go out there , get your cowboy boots and cowboy hats and get ready to write a country song .
with this exercise you are working the lats in the back , which also attach around into the front of the shoulder .so we 're going to emulate this without equipment , so you 're applying resistance with your partner .so your partner will start with their elbows pointed up towards the ceiling and you 're going to have your hands back here on the meaty part of the arm in the tricep area , so you 're below the elbow joint .and then your partner is going to try as you 're pulling towards you , your partner is going to resist away from you towards the mat with her arms .pull down as far as you can until you feel the back muscles kick in .now it 's hard to see a little bit because she 's lying on her back .but she 's actually using this part of her body , and resist down , to initiate that movement and resist against me pulling away in the opposite direction and down .this is a great way to get started if you do n't have equipment , it builds integrity into the shoulder as well .and resist down .you 'll want to work eight to ten reps starting out and then add on ten to twelve from there and three sets for the lats and shoulders .
hi , i 'm emily larew continuing on with intermediate hip hop combination .we 're now on our sixth count of eight , counts five through eight , where we 're going to add the airplane to our movements with a pop .so , we 've just reached and pulled , three and four .from here you 're going to put your right leg down , hands over .so my left hand underneath is still in a fist , my right hand is in a blade .so this is five , you 're going to open up , and six .our heads going to go with it , we 're going to lean to the right , and six .your toes are going to go out as well , and six , and straight back in .all right , so we did three and four , five and six , your arms are going to go around your head , seven , going straight underneath your chin , left over right , and you 're going to crack it , eight .all right , so what i want you to do is pretend like you hit a brick wall.

when i saw what gorgeous wood it was. [CLS] [SEP]i decided that everything that had been painted in this house the paint needed to be removed .to just show off the beautiful barreled long leaf pine so if you move into a victorian house chances are it has been painted .do n't be afraid to take the paint off .the main thing is you have to get the stripping ingredient you have to leave it on at least 45 minutes .i made the mistake of not leaving it long enough. [CLS] [SEP]and therefore i had to use many , many cans. [CLS] [SEP]and it took longer .but sometimes you can just take off the paint and the paint will antique almost the beautiful ornate work that is in a victorian house .which you need to show it is so beautiful .
now we have our heart cut out .next i 'm going to write a message on it , and i 'm going to add a couple of little stickers .now to make this more durable i 'm going to cover it in contact paper .i 'm going to take one piece and lay it down , sticky side up , and i 'm going to lay this on there. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to take another piece and lay it on top , you 'll want to press down right along the edges to make sure it seals .now we 're going to cut this out .next we need to punch a hole in the top of it .now we 're ready to add our key ring .now we have our keychain .
i 'd like to show you one of my exercises that is my most favorite for reducing the size of your thighs .first and foremost , we 're going to start off with just a yoga ball .this is what we call a walking lunge .we 're going to start with that left .bring them together .then we 're going to switch to that right .we 're placing all the importance on our heels .so this is perfect just to start off with .this is going to help you find your balance .then i like to bump up to medicine ball .this weighs about thirteen pounds .we 're going to do the same exact .we 're keeping those abs in .all the importance is on the thighs .back and front .deep breath in , blow them out .deep breath in , blow them out .so once you 've mastered the medicine ball , we 're going to go ahead and jump to some weights .these are fifteen pounds each .this is a heavy load .this is something i like to do .same exact thing .left , bringing that knee just above .together .right .together .so that is the walking lunge .lunges are great .they happen to be one of my favorites .there 's many many exercises that you can do .but what i would like to say , when it comes to legs , they 're going to be very resistant .we walk on our legs everyday .so what you 're going to have to do is go heavy or go home .
what 's that all about ?well what we 're doing here is the first measure is bimbe .the second measure 's a combined bimbe and calypso as instead of playing the bass drum on beat one anywhere in this exercise , we 're not .because we 're using the bimbe , which is just on the and of two .the difference is in what we do with the left hand .so both times we do have the double click just after beat one .but the first time we surround the second quarter note on the hi hat like .and on the second time through where we play the calypso directly on beat four .
but if you want a real strong maybe an extension of your leader , you want to double. [CLS] [SEP]your line and spider hitch is a knot that i use quite often .you 're going to take probably a little more material than , than normal for a knot because you 're going to have to kind of measure the length of your desired double line and. [CLS] [SEP]here 's where you 're going to actually place your hand .and you 're going to do kind of a reverse six. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to wrap in order around your thumb and your finger four times , going from the outside in .you run a double line through the loop and you 're going to pull and those loops are going to come off the reverse order ; and you pull the little tab in , pull the straight end. [CLS] [SEP]and now you have a double ; a double line which is called a spider hitch .
our sauce is coming to a boil so we are going to turn all of our heats off. [CLS] [SEP]and then we are going to come here to our vegetables.

[CLS] [SEP]and we are going to stir this. [CLS] [SEP]so whatever apricot preserves did not break down , the heat of this just broke them all down .now we are going to scoop a nice piece of that wet rice which is very fragrant and flavorful and we will come back to our pork chop and place. [CLS] [SEP]that here in front and give it a little stir to bring our sauce back together and we will spoon that over the top.

verbena , a good prostrate looking flowering plant .now you can see this plant could be used in hanging baskets .it could also be used in an area near walkways , where you want something that 's kind of spilling over into the landscape .often we talk ; with flowering plants , and you talk about maybe a specimen , but do n't forget plants like this that tend to spill because these often can be used in different containers where you want something to kind of give you that prostrate look .verbenas will flower about ten months a year , so they 're an excellent plant in an area where it 's frost free , so i 'd plant em ' after the last chance of frost is there , and this plant will last until next fall or early winter .if you 're really a a stouthearted person , you may want to bring it in , and see if you ca n't overwinter it in a protected site .verbena needs good sunlight ; about six hours of sun a day , and make sure that you water it on a regular basis .if it gets too dry it 'll stop flowering , so make sure that you 're watering probably every second or third day .verbena is an excellent landscape plant .for on gardening , i 'm stan de freitas , mr. [CLS] [SEP]green thumb .
at this point we 've painted our wings , we 've cut them out , they 're dry , they 're set aside , and we 're ready to start outlining the body of the dragonfly .this we want to make sure that we do precisely because this is where we find the shape of our butterfly. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to do it with a light colored pencil .so we want to give ourselves a mark of where the head is going to go , and also we 're going to travel down the body .we 're going to give ourselves a nice straight line , take it all the way down to the bottom , and then we 're also going to plot out the wings .so we 're going to bring the wings out this way , and down here , and it 's a faint line , but we 'll be able to see it when we 're attaching everything .if you have n't already ripped all of your tape up , this is also a good time to do it because we 're going to start rolling the paper. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll need some tape available during that time .we 're going to cut paper and roll it and attach it all the way up the body of the dragonfly , so it 's important to keep your line faint because we may be seeing it in between .
now we 're going to look at the two sides of footwear in the 60 's .the main appearance that was new was the appearance of boots .especially boots as wear for women .previously boots had only been worn by men , maybe in the working environment .women really did n't wear them .they wore evening shoes .and so the mods popularized a mid-calf or knee-high boot .i 'm wearing an example right now .now , these you can see a few things , one , there 's a very high heel .you either wanted the heel to be really high. [CLS] [SEP]or you wanted it to be flat .there was n't really too much in between that .it 's suede , which was a very popular fabric and these are off-white , but it 's a neutral .there was virtually no color in mod dressing , it was white , it was black , occasionally you would have a splash of red in there , but in general it was just white or black .and so these boots really go along with that .i have another pair of boots for the mod look that i can show you .and these would actually have been worn mostly by women but maybe even by men .some men were wearing heels at the times on their boots .and these are a very small heel .they 're practically flat .and they 're mid-calf length which means they 're lower than the boots. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm wearing right now .and that was actually a new length as far as boots or any shoes , really , that emerged in the 60 's .these are also leather you can see .the shoes , really , not much synthetic fabric as far as that goes .leather was really the way to go .and these were especially popularized in england .you 'll see old pictures of the beatles and they 're in boots similar to this .it was really just the mainstay of mod fashion .now , once again , as a counterpoint to those shoes , you have what the hippies wore .and we see similarly to the way we saw in jewelry a really great love of natural fabrics and natural colors .so i 'm going to show you some hippie shoes .now these might not look so dissimilar to something we might wear today. [CLS] [SEP]but i want to point out a few things .one , they are actually genuine leather which means it 's a natural material. [CLS] [SEP]and they 're handmade , once again , which would be really important to hippie culture .they 're also a neutral color ; brown and bronze or tan were really popular .and they 're completely flat .alot of hippies did n't wear shoes at all , they went completely barefoot .but where that was n't allowed or where it was n't practical , like in a city , they would often wear shoes like this .just look at how completely different these are than a mod shoe .these really show you the feet whereas a boot covers it up as much as possible .
we have different colors and we are going to coordinate them on each side .i have 4 pictures that i have got for free actually. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to put these up to cover some of the imperfections on the wall paper .some of these imperfections that just do n't look very good. [CLS] [SEP]you wo n't even know it by the time i get through .
then we have the c minor use as the same key signature once again b and e as b flat major .[ play saxophone ] .then the five is going to be f. [CLS] [SEP][ play saxophone ] .which is also very nicely today , i do n't really mean major sound of that b flat major scale .[ play saxophone ] .once again , if you run that whole scale over the whole horn , right .if i go top to bottom [ play saxophone ] , you can hear that it is just like a lot of different scales but depending on where you start and end , that 's what gives it is characteristic sound .
now we 're going to show you a technique from the inside position of the body where you 're actually going to take and step out of the way .as you 're doing , sort of like what we did in previous clip , pushing down the head , pulling up on the arm .but instead of twisting the person in front of you , you 're actually going to be taking your right or left leg and stepping out of the way and allowing the person to actually move through .this can also be done if someone is charging at you , trying to shoot in to grab your legs. [CLS] [SEP], all you got to do is just take your hand , press down on top of their head , step out of the way , and they 'll actually sort of end up into a roll position .but for right now we 're going to throw it from a punch .we 'll step back. [CLS] [SEP]so you guys can see this .i 'm going to throw a punch .comes in , blocks .again , she throws a loosening up technique .wraps around the back of my head .now the key part here is to take the right leg and to swing it back out of the way at the same time as pulling down the head all the way down .and , also make sure that when you pull up the arm that you want to continue a good constant pressure. [CLS] [SEP]so it does n't break down .scoot over a little bit .ok , so again , we 'll try it a little bit at full speed .i 'll step in and throw the punch .blocks , throws the punch and right on the back of the head and actually go down to the ground .like i said , that 's going to bring you up into a roll position .so the person may not necessarily just fall flat .they may roll and be able to come right back up .so , in a self defense situation , that 's something that you want to pay attention to as far as having your next move planned .so , there you go .that 's what we call a side twist from the inside position .
now we want to add the arm and hand movements to the simple marking step .so we 're going to bring the arms up to fifth position , our spanish fifth .and notice now as i mark with the right foot , the right arm drops. [CLS] [SEP]and i make a circle with the wrist .so i mark out on one , and then up on two .left side , three and up on four .right side out and feet together and mark and out and feet together .and notice that the elbow stays up as i mark , and up and through and out and two and three and four .and out and two , up three and four .and out on two , and now i 'm going to use both arms and opening both arms .one and two , three and four .i finish one and two and the last mark , three and ole .
upward dog being the sister to the downward dog is going to incorporate spinal flexion and strengthen the core and really open up the chest and the shoulders .coming down with your elbows right underneath your shoulders , curl your toes , extend back and always find your active range of motion by starting here and with a slight bend of the elbows you release the energy through the top of the head .you do n't want to arch in the back , and you want to pull your navel into your spine so you 're not resting and letting that fall into the mat. [CLS] [SEP]so you 're supporting the integrity of the spine , keeping a slight bend in the elbows and looks center , release , retract in the scapula. [CLS] [SEP]so your shoulders fall right out of your ears .inhale exhale really release up to the pelvis into the top of the head , try not to let everything fall into the mat , holding for ten to twenty seconds , breathing inhale , exhale , back into child 's pose or shell stretch and roll up .the biggest mistake you 'll see with an upward dog is arching the back and putting too much hyper , flexion on the low back .your goal is to elongate the spine and reach your energy through the top of the head and work within your active range of motion on your upper dog .
in this segment , i will be talking to you about how to fight bosses. [CLS] [SEP]or they call them psychopaths in dead rising .all the bosses will have different weapons .sometimes , you 'll be fighting more than one at a time .things like that .but , when it comes down to it all the bosses you pretty much fight exactly the same in this game .you stay far away from them. [CLS] [SEP]and you shoot them with guns .close combat with bosses , usually results in you just dying really quickly .that 's one thing that sucks about this game , is the bosses are they 're ridiculously hard .even when you 're at a low level .ok.to get to the first boss in the game , which is his name is carlito .you want to make your way out into the courtyard , which i 've already shown you how to get there .and , fighting some bosses are part of your case files .others are not .this is part of your case file .so , i can access my watch and toggle it on to bring up an arrow to tell me exactly how to get to him .ok.so , there has just been a cut scene showing you that you are about to fight carlito .he 's up high , up above. [CLS] [SEP]they 're shooting you with a gun .so , you want to make sure you do n't get shot .right here , there 's a bar .there 's wine at the bar .wine 's a good source of health .i recommend remembering that 's there .because , if your health gets low you can always run back here .i recommend using the shotgun or the uzi that i told you to get earlier in other segments .but , basically every boss is the same for the most part .you kind of want to keep your distance and just fire at him with a gun .and , it 's a little tedious. [CLS] [SEP]and it takes awhile .because , they 'll move around and then you get a couple bullets in them. [CLS] [SEP]and then they move around .if you 're really feeling .see , that 's what happens when you get too close .they just shoot you and you fall .after you defeat carlito the first time that is part of a case mission .so , after you kill him it will come up saying showing you that you have completed that part of the case mission .when you exit , you exit this screen you can continue to follow the arrow to the next part of the case mission .and , eventually you will just be following someone around and that will complete case one .every time you fight a boss , he 's not it 's not always part of a case mission .sometimes , it 's just some crazy guy in the mall .but , usually when you 're killing bosses is the best for helping you level up .killing bosses and saving lives get you the most points to level up .
we would need one from both sides. [CLS] [SEP]so i would cut another length just the same .i have chosen this color of ribbon because one of the main contrasting fabric that i would be using this one .i thought that it would coordinate well with it .i 'm just going to kind of wrap the ribbon around the top edge here this top section .sew it right over the top of it like this .that is it .there is our reinforced edge .
so , after you 've taken your turn and your opponent has taken his turn and. [CLS] [SEP]you 've found out who won the next hand the tables turn , if you will , you switch dealers .so , if you go first on a turn and then i go. [CLS] [SEP]that 's one turn .that 's one round if you will .the next hand around. [CLS] [SEP]i go first so that we each get an equal number of opportunities to have the advantage .with my advantage i roll .i get a pair of sixes .i know you can probably beat a pair of sixes in two rolls. [CLS] [SEP]so i roll again .i improve to three sixes .now it 's your turn .so , that turn i still had an advantage , because i knew better than to stop with a pair of sixes .so , even when i have to use a second roll i 'm still employing my i get to go first advantage ; if you will .so remember that , but after every hand or round the person who goes first changes .
and then you want to tie it as close to the end of the pieces as possible .we 'll do a little of wiggling to get that down there and pull it down nice , and tight , figure 8. [CLS] [SEP]makes a good lumpy knot. [CLS] [SEP]cause we need that to hold the bracelet on .pull it nice and tight and remember to leave about a quarter inch on the end , do n't cut it right up close becuase. [CLS] [SEP]the could cause the knot to come undone , about a quarter inch __ discard. [CLS] [SEP]that. [CLS] [SEP]and then you can open up your loop. [CLS] [SEP]put your loop right up on there. [CLS] [SEP], the loop just gets caught on the knot like that and that 's our spiral bracelet .
hi , this is yolanda vanveen from vanveenbulbs.com. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're learning all about how to grow bamboo , one of my favorite plants .bamboo is just a grass , it grows no differently than the grass in your lawn. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's very easy to grow in a container or the ground , it 's so simple .whether you buy them as a clump in a pot at the garden center or you start them as a root , either way they 're so simple .basically , all you do , just like a piece of grass , you just divide another piece out. [CLS] [SEP]and then you either plant that in the ground or a container .knowing that this is a running bamboo. [CLS] [SEP]so it will take over , eventually ,so you kind of want to be careful with it .i like to put them in containers or at least in an area where i can contain them , whether it 's between the sidewalk and the street or. [CLS] [SEP]somewhere where they 're not going to become a problem eventually .they 're just an easy thing to grow and all you need is a little tiny piece of root and you can have a new bamboo plant , does n't take much at all .bamboo prefer full hot all day sun , they really like heat and sun to grow well but just like your grass and your garden , they can handle some shade too. [CLS] [SEP]so you can put them in a little bit of shade as well .good composted or good soil is the key too , they want something to grab onto .if you have only clay , just put some compost on top and then put your bamboo into that. [CLS] [SEP]and it 'll grow really well .bamboo are one of the simplest plants to grow , sun , part shade , about three inches deep , make sure that dirt is covered , if it 's a root , it 's covered , the sprout is out of the ground and you can separate it as needed .remember , there 's two types of bamboo there 's the running that takes over. [CLS] [SEP]so you 've got to be careful about putting that in the ground or the clumping that stays more of a clump with more of a like a tree coming up. [CLS] [SEP], they do n't really take over .so , when you 're planting them , make sure you know which is which and plant them in the correct spaces because you never want to put a running bamboo next to a park , for example , where you 're not going to be able to maintain it or a water way where it can get into the water and the seeds can get everywhere .make sure that you can contain them because they are a beautiful plant but like other plants , that can become invasive , you 've got to really be careful where you put them .
okay now i 'm going to give you my thousand dollar tip .i 'm probably going to lose a lot of money over this tip .but this is going to help you tremendously .whenever you get into an injury , for example you 're out pulling weeds in the back yard and you hurt your low back .you pick up a heavy box and you hurt your low back. [CLS] [SEP], you sleep on your pillow wrong and you wake up in the morning. [CLS] [SEP]and you have tremendous neck pain .the first thing you need to do is put ice on it .you can either use one of these ice gel packs that you can reuse and put in the freezer .you can use a sandwich bag full of ice cubes .you can use a bag of frozen peas , it really does n't matter .but you want to put something cold on it .and you do n't want to put the ice directly on your skin because you do n't want to get frostbite .so you 'd like to use a thin cotton towel in between the two .now when you put ice on , it 's going to first feel kind of cold and achy .then you may get a little bit of a burning sensation and then toward the end , you will get numbness .the reason why you feel that is because during the time that the ice is on your body , your body 's going to actually be contracting a little bit .and it 's going to be drawing out all the swollen fluids .so that gives you that kind of burny , achy feeling .but towards the end of the twenty minutes , you will get numbness .now remember , do not go longer than twenty minutes .after twenty minutes , it 'll actually reverse the entire therapeutic process and make it worse .your body will think that the skin in that area is dying and start pushing fluid back into that area .now most people who generally when they get hurt , think that you need to use heat .heat feels good. [CLS] [SEP], it 's warm , it 's fuzzy , it 's comforting .but heat attracts fluid which will increase swelling , increase inflammation and increase your pain .it 's such a very common thing that i see , that someone will be out in their yard pulling weeds or they will be picking up a heavy ice chest or something .and they will have low back pain .then that night , they will decide to sleep on an electric heating pad .and the next day they are in so much pain , they can not get out of bed .so what 's happening is they put the heat pack on , and. [CLS] [SEP]the heat 's increase , it 's attracting fluid and it increases the swelling .so it becomes so swollen. [CLS] [SEP]and so irritated that the next day they wind up here in my office .in medicine in general , they call it the golden hour , which is if you 're in a severe injury , you have this golden hour to save someone 's life .but you can also use this golden hour after any injury if it 's not life threatening , to immediately put ice .and after that golden hour or during that golden hour , you may prevent any serious injury to your spine at all .so once again , please remember use ice , not heat .
alright , now that we 're working with really wet clay , this is a good thing to do here .get down on it .and you probably ca n't see what i 'm doing .i 'll do it from this angle .get on there and just fold this in there like that .alright ?you can do some finger mush , just hold the rim of your pot , do n't worry about tweaking it out , obviously ,since we 've abused it so much .but pull it in there like that .we can go back there can clean that up .what we want to do , i like this. [CLS] [SEP], remember ; make it look like it 's been faceted on there with a rivet gun or something , alright ?and i 'm going to go back and do the same thing with this other ear .
so we finished the tile mosaic .here it is , the product before grouting .i 've waited twenty four hours for the glue to dry fully , and now we 're down here in my grouting studio , which is a place i do n't mind getting messy .and it 's something that you want to think about because grouting is a very messy process .i 've also changed into clothes that i do n't really care about just in case grout gets on me , which usually does happen .we 're ready to go .i 've put on gloves to protect my hands during the grouting process .you also want to make sure that you wear a dust mask while you mix dry grout .once it 's mixed , you can take the mask off .what you 're going to do is take the grout ,in this case i 've chosen a nice , soft yellow , which goes beautifully with our project and you 're going to mix it slowly with some water .mix the water in very slowly because if you mix too much water in , then you 're going to have to add more grout. [CLS] [SEP]and you might end up making way too much .you 're going to mix it until you get something the consistency of about peanut butter .at that point , you need to wait about five minutes for it to sleek .basically just set before it 's ready to go onto your project .perfect .
with the wheel going at a fast rate of speed and wetting our hands ; we 're going to use our right hand pushing down , left hand pushing in towards the center and compress that rod shape back into itself .the more speed you have on the wheel at this stage the greater the control that you will have and slowly releasing the pressure. [CLS] [SEP]; right hand pushing down , elbows close to your body ; upper body weight leaning over the piece , left hand pushing in .and it 's the equal pressure of pushing down and pushing in that will eventually cause the piece to be centered .
it is called a saddle bag and. [CLS] [SEP]if you do n't know chloe it is a very high end designer line .it is out of paris. [CLS] [SEP]and this is a great bag again for living in new york city. [CLS] [SEP]it has a nice long strap you can wear it with ease , you can wear it with comfort , you can wear the bag in front of you , you can wear it behind you like this .again it has many compartments in the inside. [CLS] [SEP]we have 2 zippers right here .and nothing but inner zipper pockets on the inside and what is also really cool about this bag is it comes with a pad lock .a pad lock and a key. [CLS] [SEP]so you can really secure your belongings if say if you are at a bar or a restaurant and got up to use the ladies room. [CLS] [SEP]you know your bag is secure with your friends where you are sitting .
alright , so now that we got it almost there .i 'm going to do one last pull. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to put a little shape in this .we 'll put a little , give it a little dance , make it unique .because some potters might leave it like that and put a little bottom on it , but that 's pretty boring .we do n't want to do that .we want this thing to pop out at people .to dance in their cupboards .so , once again , you 've got your chuto monde on the bottom , so you do n't want to have to go in there with the sponge and ruin. [CLS] [SEP]that nice little spiral that you 've got down there .so , let 's not put too much water down .just enough to get that last pull .and come in , go as far as your fingers can go down .start pulling .ok ?and sit .ok , so we got as high as we want to go .it 's looking good .i 'm going to take my needle tool once again and put it on the top here .right , do n't try to lose so much height , go right until you start to feel your finger again .pull it off and now you 're all even up top .we 'll put that over here to dry out on my canvas .take this. [CLS] [SEP]and you see i got like. [CLS] [SEP], my sponge is kind of cut in half here , so you can just put it right on top like that .make a lip .you 're making a lip .this is where people 's lips going to be , so you want it to be nice .you do n't want it to be all funky .you do n't want it to be all thick , because then they 'll dribble .so make it nice .emphasis on the lip .ok ?and now , we 've done all our pulls .we 're going to come back. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to make this thing unique .
so , let 's talk about a four player game .we 're going to give each player seven bones .i 'll go ahead and take my seven .now you take your seven .hope you have a good hand .and now we 'll divvy up the rest .then we 'll start playing .now , what do you notice ?no bone yard right ?double six always leads , i played the double six and then play travels around to the left .so , does this player have any sixes ?yes , right there .do you have a six or a five ?you have a five .and how about this player ?this player now needs a six or a three .there 's a three , plays it there .now , i need to play a six or a four .i can do so , but what if i could n't ?what if i look at all my bones and i do n't have one with a six or a four on one of the sides ?well , there 's no bone yard. [CLS] [SEP], i have to say , `` pass . [CLS] [SEP]''play moves on to the left .
surgical forceps are used to carefully isolate your lashes to apply the extensions .novalash bond adhesive is used to then bond the lashes in place .as a customer , you will lay down on a massage table with your eyes closed .you may listen to music or just fall asleep .you will not feel a thing because these lashes are not touching your skin .you will only feel the faint touch of my fingertips and the forceps through your lashes .you will not feel any pain during this procedure .
okay , now we 're going to strengthen our leg , give a little bit more of tone and what we 're going to try to do is use a chair in the house .make sure it 's safe .make sure there 's no slippery or sliding around , okay .always safety .safety is first .that 's the first thing you got to make sure .okay .the first thing we 're going to do ,yeah ,if you have done it before , you went up to stairs before ,i know you have .but , what we 're going to try to do is make a little bit more big , a little bit bigger step .so that will help with the toning and give you strength , so make sure you go out your body all the way up and all the way down .yeah .that 's the first move that we 're going to try to do .yeah .do n't try to jump or push because. [CLS] [SEP]and then , you do n't know what this train a lot .yeah .what are we going to try to do is to do that resistant that come out only with your leg , and the same thing when you go down .when you go down , try to resist .all the way up , all the way down .all the way up , and all the way down .yes .and you can do it opposite now .now you 're going to start with the right. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to go down .and you go up , try to go even from one side to another side .okay .we 're going to go to the next move .
and i showed you how to do it with pinto beans .well this is basically what they would look like with black beans .by morning 8 hours later after you soaked them for any 8 hour period that you soak them they would start to grow .when they have got bigger like this then this is my other secret to saving a lot of money i really like these slow cookers .this is 2 different types of slow cookers , a crock pot is actually a brand name but the name of what these are really. [CLS] [SEP]are are slow cookers .we are just going to take our soaked beans. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to actually rinse out the water from the night before .then put in new water into the pan along with our black beans .so now we have fresh water and the beans that have now gotten bigger .we are going to put the lid on. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to leave these for about 4-6 hours .that is our new black bean that would be cooked .
ok , now we are going to learn how to play the right hand chorus of `` jingle bells . [CLS] [SEP]''the right hand chorus starts out with the key of e.so , we are going to start out playing e. [CLS] [SEP]now. [CLS] [SEP], these notes are e and we are going to go up to g , this is g , c , d ,e. [CLS] [SEP]now , we are going to f to e , d , e , d , and then back to g.so , to wrap it up we 'll play it again .
today i 'm going to be discussing fielding and more specifically the fielding percentage statistic .it 's really the only statistic that is common amongst defensive players .and the way that you calculate the fielding percentage is your assist plus your put outs .now what 's an assist ?assist is you can pick up as the beginning of an out being made .so it 's the shortstop fielding the ball .what 's the put out ?it 's the first basement catching the ball , so. [CLS] [SEP]it 's the end of the out ok.now to calculate the fielding percentage you simply divide that by your total chances which is your assist plus your put outs plus your errors .ok.so that is going to give you your fielding percentage .the best time to use your fielding percentage for me when i have coached is using for my middle end fielders , it 's very important to know what they are doing from day to day .that is very telling of how your defense is doing .also your center fielder , your first baseman , those are some key positions that you really want to use fielding percentages statistic .my name is jamie cevallas. [CLS] [SEP]and we just covered fielding percentage .
hi .again , we 're talking about some of the tools and some of the materials that you 're going to be using for your copper foiling project .one thing that i would recommend is what 's called a copper foil dispenser .reason being is. [CLS] [SEP]if you do n't have one of these and you 're working with your copper foil , you might notice that it ends up coming apart like this. [CLS] [SEP]and it 'll get all messy and messed up .and just arrange , you 'll have bent tape and it 'll just be a real hassle .so , what i suggest that you do is in one of these dispensers , it also holds all of your different widths of your tape so that you can actually have them all on hand as you decide which one you 're going to use for each project .it comes with a little slit , down at the bottom which you would slide your tape through so that you would be able to use it and easily dispense it. [CLS] [SEP]and it 'll hold your roll in place , just like that .so , it makes it nice and neat and a lot easier for you to deal with this part of the process .
one other little detail cut that we need to make before we can begin sanding on this is at the very top .the piece of wood that i started with had a fairly rough band saw cut on the top edge .and you 'll notice as i rotate this around. [CLS] [SEP], you 'll see that it wobbles a little bit .it 's not true to the rest of the piece .and so i 'm going to come in with a skew. [CLS] [SEP], this is a skew here , and with the long point or the toe of the skew , i 'm just going to take a light shearing cut and clean off that end grain and through that top up. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's nice and crisp .because we have a wooden chuck here holding this , i can cut right down to the wood and not worry about marring the tip of my tool .and so now the end grain on this is really nice and clean .
i think that the idea is to dress for the weather .recognize that in many birding situations weather , obviously , can be less than optimum .certainly in tropical situations where rain is an issue , it 's always handy to have a light poncho or even a small portable umbrella that you can pop up during tropical rain showers .if you 're birding on the water , dress in layers with a windbreaker and a sweat shirt or something underneath .in the winter , obviously , it 's very critical to dress warmly with appropriate winter clothing .and these days , so many sports stores and so forth have all manner of outdoor gear and wear .foot wear is especially critical .for many situations in the summer , sandals are just fine if you 're going to be birding by the seashore .at the same time , if you 're going to be hiking in rugged areas , lightweight hiking gear or hiking boots of various sorts .in many cases , it can be wet underfoot , and in some cases , particularly in the early spring or in situations where you 're in marshy areas , actually having boots .and , i have here a pair of what are called `` wellies '' or wellington boots .these are basically just rubber boots .and , they are very effective in that they just slip on .and , you can then not be as concerned where you have to walk .there are boots now that can be pulled on over hiking shoes or sneakers , that if you throw them in a backpack , you can very quickly transition from , you know , sort of dry land to aquatic situations .so , just be practical in your packing .do n't think fashion first .think in terms of , of what 's going to be most appropriate for the environment that you 're in and , what 's going to be most , or least. [CLS] [SEP], i should say , disruptive to the birds that you 're looking for .
the most important part of shooting is getting down the mechanics .in showing you the mechanics , i first want to show you , ?feet placement '' .so when you are placing your feet and you are trying to learn the mechanics to shooting , you want you feet shoulder width apart .balance , so you can be balanced , so that if any defensive man comes in and tries to move you while you are trying to shoot they can not , because you have a firm plant , a firm foundation .next , you want to make sure that you grab the ball so that the lines are horizontal to your body , sometimes you do not always have that option , sometimes when you catch the ball , someone throws it to you crazy , you might have to catch it. [CLS] [SEP], how you catch it .but when you catch the ball you want to try and make sure you have the line horizontal to you. [CLS] [SEP]body , you put your hand right there in the center of the ball. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to keep space , keep the ball on your finger tips and keep space in between your hand and the ball , like that .so , keep your wrist loose , not tight , loose and take your other hand and just use it for basically use it for support .get your balance , elbows up , eyes on your target. [CLS] [SEP]and then you follow through , there you go .you always want to make sure you got a backwards rotation .backwards rotation and what the backwards rotations does is , when you are shooting it , if you have a backwards rotation , it has more of a chance of going in if it hits any part of the rim .so let us go ahead and take a shot , remember you want a firm foundation .`` b.e.e.f '' , balance , elbows up , eyes on target , follow through and remember you are not going to make all of them. [CLS] [SEP]so that is the point of the drill. [CLS] [SEP], you continually try until you knock it down .once you knock it down do not stop .remember practice makes perfect .there you go and there you have it , `` shooting mechanics '' .
so this is a scale that has over tones of many diverse cultures .in a jazz sense it can be used over the chord that i just mentioned , minor 7 flat 5. [CLS] [SEP]but you can also hear it in chords around the world. [CLS] [SEP]and it seems like whatever part of the world. [CLS] [SEP]you go to someone. [CLS] [SEP]uses this sort of chord or scale. [CLS] [SEP]and it is very exotic .it 's that flat second that does that .but it also just to outline the seventh chord once again it is always important when you have any kind of seventh chord to really outline what is going on with it and embellish those particular memories to start with .it 's not an end. [CLS] [SEP]all be all. [CLS] [SEP]but it is a good basis to start with .notice that i 'm complimenting the one , the three , the five and the seven. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm complimenting the one with the flat two which is really cool .
hi , it 's dowell at the firehouse detail shop. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're interior detailing today , and we 're teaching you how to do it like a professional .we 've started the top. [CLS] [SEP], we 've got our headliner clean , now we 've loosened the dirt , we 've vacuumed it up .we 're going to move from the headliner to the vinyl , then door panels , the dash and we 're working from the top moving down , that way. [CLS] [SEP]if we got drips that go down on the carpet or on other areas. [CLS] [SEP]that 's the last area and we go through , and we do a nice clean up of that .so what i get. [CLS] [SEP]and i got is a good interior cleaner , this one 's a interior cleaner , we also use one with some delamonine in it which is nice .this is one of my favorites the express cleaner from bud co. [CLS] [SEP]and p , and s.but what i 'm going to do is get a good , get a good towel. [CLS] [SEP], i 've got my brush. [CLS] [SEP]and i 've got another brush here that collin 's going to get me that we like to scrub door panels , and things with .it can be as simple as a , as a big , big bristled brush or this one here that will allow this to get in nooks crannies and crevices .so i 'm going to actually , in a situation like this where i 've got. [CLS] [SEP]a dirty door panel , where someone 's had their arms , spilled ; i 'm simply going to take me cleaner and just start spraying the door panel , and let it soak a little bit .and from top to bottom using a towel , my small toothbrush , and i 'm going to start going through these crevices and just loosen the dirt .small crevices first and weather. [CLS] [SEP]i need the , the any one .you want to be cautious around buttons , lock buttons ,window buttons not to saturate that too much .those are often the most dirty parts because they 're dirty hands going in and operating hose buttons. [CLS] [SEP]so we got to clean around them , and in them .again you can grab compressed air and once it 's stopped , you 've loosed it , you can go in and you can blow the dirt around there .you 're going to spread more dirt , you 're going to get it up on the windows. [CLS] [SEP], you 're going to get it on yourself , that o.k .because right now we 're worried about cleaning the small cracks and crevices .i love grabbing the big brush and then hitting the broad areas where arms rest , door panels .if you want to be cautious with speakers , you do n't want to saturate an area , you certainly do n't want to saturate a speaker but those speaker grills are very tough , tough to get clean. [CLS] [SEP]so you might want to put a little cleaner on a , on a towel , spray that up , you got holes. [CLS] [SEP], you got bugs. [CLS] [SEP]so you go there and just keep working through that .you might have to take the brush on it a little bit .but we 're going to clean this door panel pretty thoroughly. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 're going to get a clean towel , and we 're going to start at the top and just start removing the dirt , the cleaner and just continue to wipe this panel until it 's done .often in a cup holder like we 've got here or a tray , trash dirt will collect there. [CLS] [SEP]so we 'll want to have probably vacuumed that before hand .and then when we 're finished because there might be some moisture or some dirt that ran down the door , we get into here. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to wipe that out really good , clean that out .so now we 've got our door panel , we 're going to do a similar cleaning on our dashboard here .we 're going to go through , again brushes , toothbrushes .we 're going to clean all that up with our interior cleaner. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 're going to wrap that up , and we 'll have our door panels , our things ...
and this is perfect to practice with .this is what your palm is going to look like , your going to take your bo and put it above your head and spin it on your palm , just like that , it 's going to rotate .ok now the escrima is good practice , just so you can get the feel of it , get the feel of balance , ok you just want to learn how to do all that and keep it moving around and spin .you want to build momentum , good .so once you get that down , go ahead and pick up you r bo , this is a really cool move you are going to do , you can go from helicopter spin one , through your fingers and come back across two , and palm spin all above the head .so one more time from here , one , two and palm spin above the head .alright so now this is how we are going to go through it .you are going to have it on this side ,ok , take your two fingers over here , go through the fingers , helicopter spin go switch sides , i do that do build up momentum and pull all the way back .alright do it , you are going to take the bo and do it and put your hand as flat as possible right above your head ,ok if it 's tilted in any direction , your bo is going to fall off .so from here you are going to go up and spin the bo all around in a circle and catch it between your thumb and your first finger and bring it down .alright so again one , two back across. [CLS] [SEP]and then you can do it really quick. [CLS] [SEP]and you can do some strikes , one , two ,three come across one and then palm spin , two-alah-and it 's a good catch .and that 's going to be a really nice part you can add. [CLS] [SEP]and it will look real good in the beginning , you can throw out your comments together ok from here. [CLS] [SEP]you go around the back , into the air go. [CLS] [SEP]try a helicopter all the way into a palm spin and back .and that 's going to be your palm spin , practice that , that one is going to take a lot of practice. [CLS] [SEP], it 's kind of difficult .you will drop it a bunch of times , sometimes it is going to fall on your head. [CLS] [SEP]so you 're just going to have to watch it .the best way to do it is in front of a mirror , if you have a mirror to watch yourself , cause you do n't want to look up all the time at it , because when you are going you want to be able to look at the direction you 're going. [CLS] [SEP]so you just want to be able to spin it right above your head without looking .alright so use a mirror that 's going to be real helpful for you .
so people ask me what is the key to a successful hoophouse and. [CLS] [SEP]truthfully i say just that you build it and that it 's strong and that it 's strong enough to persevere through difficult weather .if you 're like me , once you 've built it you will find enumerable opportunities .whether it 's the heat loving or cold loving crops. [CLS] [SEP]but you need to build one because without a hoophouse you 're still going to be working with limited environment .so there are two basic designs to look at .this is the quancid or the round arch and this is the gothic arch that comes up to a peak here .now this one is very simple and will be a little less expensive to build .this one 's slightly more complicated , you 'll need a little more bracing , however the gothic arch is supposedly better for shedding snow .
i would take black polish or white , any polish .i would put it on a hard surface. [CLS] [SEP]so i could have my dotting tool to dot it .remember to make sure that your polish hits the nail so the circles would look smaller and i would use silver .just do a straight line coming up after the first dot .i tried it after the second dot ; it did n't look great .that 's the dragonfly .remember to make sure that your dotter touches the nail or else. [CLS] [SEP]your dots will look uneven -- like it would be big and then small and then big and then small instead of look even , like from larger to smaller dots .okay ?
alright , this is a game called disgruntled groom , and it 's really funny because if you play it with a whole group of girls at a bachelorette party , you 'll be amazed at how many things that they do that they 're not supposed to .first , you want to make a list of rules .make a list of things that a disgruntled groom would never complain about .he would never say that this outfit makes him look fat , he would never complain about a broken nail , that he 's bloated , he has bad skin , that he needs to get his roots done .he needs to get his nails done .all of these things that a groom would never say .also , things he would never do .he would never cross his legs .so if you cross your legs at the knees and the ankles , that 's something a groom would never do .make a whole list of these things and give each attendee of the bachelorette party a strand of beads .every time they do something that 's on this list , you can take one of their beads .every attendee is going to get a list of all the rules , of all the things a disgruntled groom would never do or say , so that they know that if a girl says , `` oh my gosh , i broke a nail '' , they 're going to steal her beads .at the end of the night , the girl who has the most beads is going to win a prize , and she also gets to keep all the great mardi gras beads. [CLS] [SEP]so if you want to get some really cool ones that have little brides on them , that 's a great thing too , because they 're a great keepsake and a great trophy to have from being the winner of the game .
a good way to do this is get a little bit on your spoon .just let it drip back and forth .you can get a little artsy with this .we do n't want too much chocolate .just enough .at this point , like the sugar , we do n't want them all looking exactly the same .it 's something your kids can do .a little bit of sugar and a little bit of the chocolate on top of each one .just gives it a nice little texture when you 're eating it .there you go .these are our cookies , and enjoy !
in this clip we are going to talk about chala .which is another technique you use. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's a style of playing that occurs both solo and with a tuba player .and that 's where you use the sympathetic strings. [CLS] [SEP]these are these three up here .which are kind of used as a drown of their own .and you use them in various combinations .you use them both in a lop , which we will talk more about later .kind of with that rhythm .now the gala goes faster and has a lot more rhythm .us can use various combinations .
let 's let that compound dry and get strong and then we will go over it with the ceiling texture .there may be recessed places where you need to put more ceiling texture and it is able to do that. [CLS] [SEP]but if you get the ceiling texture too thick on there , it will actually end up cracking in the end to .so what you want is a medium thickness overall .we use a brush or trial to work the material into the corners .it will help us to get better coverage there in the corners .
in this clip we 're going to teach you how to keep dogs in the same household from fighting .again we have our tools , a leash and a tab .and as you can see we 've conditioned these dogs to know , we have two males dogs here and a female , we 've conditioned them to get along in the same household .and that 's because there 's one alpha. [CLS] [SEP]and there 's one leader .so if any fights do break out i 'm in charge , i can separate them , and they accept my role as pack leader .and everybody breaks it up , if anything does ever break out .however , the best thing that you can do is get a male and a female , instead of two males or two females .and give them lots of exercise , discipline , and affection .and giving them those three things is going to help you achieve harmony in their household .this is zephyr clarke-dollberg , and this has been how to keep dogs in the same house from fighting .
this drink is called `` brown cocktail '' .go ahead and start by adding your ice to your glass. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 're going to do a half an ounce of gin , half an ounce of light rum , and a half an ounce of dry vermouth like so .shake these three ingredients together really good because it is just three alcohol components and you want to get them as cold as possible .the colder they are the smoother they taste .there we go , that 's probably good .grab your cocktail glass , martini glass if you will and strain these three ingredients on in .now this is called a `` brown cocktail '' .it is obviously not named after its color .i 'm going to go ahead and guess that there is a mr. [CLS] [SEP]brown out there that loves his rum , gin and dry vermouth so cheers to you mr. [CLS] [SEP]brown .
for example , this is pon framing liu .carry .frame , carry .frame , carry .frame and carry .the other side .frame , carry .frame is like outside block .carry is like inside block .you see that .frame , carry .and look at my hand. [CLS] [SEP]it is always right here .frame .carry .it can go this way , it can go that way .so i am going to have my assistant to show you how to to do it .now like i said pon and liu .pon .liu .pon .liu .pon .liu .liu means carry it in .carry my hands inward and my body will follow to that direction .now look at this pon , stop right here .carry .now watch the hand , it goes straight to the eyes .it goes straight to the eyes .one more time , pon , in .actually there are two types .he was using the thumb but later on he can simply carry that hand in .that brushing my hand inward , brushing the hands inward .take a look like this .so again , pon , liu .this technique will conclude this session of liu .and let us move on to ji .ji means push .
do some final knot hole darkening. [CLS] [SEP]and then just over all tone them down .after that we would see what is next .so basically right now i 'm just taking my diluted black enhancing the center of all these little knots holes making them look a little dents , dark .randomly pick a few veins and color them pretty dark .( airbrushing ) ca n't forget about the jam side cause when people open the door you do n't want to have a big orange spot .alright our next segment. [CLS] [SEP]we are going to put a line about a 8th of a inch on top of this panel here to make it look like it has a 45 degree on it just to kind of finish it off .
you know , there is a special rule , a house rule , it could be considered the universal house rule of five-card draw and i want to be sure to mention it .it 's that you have to have an ace to be able to draw four .now frankly , in our , in my demonstration here i did n't include that rule. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's for a simple fact .the rule should really only be in place if you have enough people at the table or enough loose players at the table that you need to be worried about the deck running out before everybody can draw cards .the fact is , this is a four person game , we ca n't run out of cards because it 's five to each for the deal , that 's twenty cards and then a maximum of four each for the draw , that 's thirty-six .therefore , no special rule .but most of the time , like in a large game , someone 's home game , there 'll be a rule that you have to have an ace to be able to throw away four cards and draw four more .so just keep that in mind , but we 're not playing that way for our examples today .
have you been in need of a good trim , afraid to go to the stylist ?well here are a few tips you can use to help trim your own hair .make sure you have a good comb .make sure you have very sharp shears , do n't cut yourself.and. [CLS] [SEP]remember , have patience .utilize two mirrors .one in front , and one in back .always have someone nearby to help you get the cut that you need .remember , trimming your hair is something that has to be done in order to avoid all those split ends .so if you ca n't make it to your professional stylist , preparation is key .having the right tools is very important .make sure you have your trusty scissors , your comb , a really good cape to protect you from the hair falling on your shoulders , and i think you 'll be able to do a good job .now remember , trimming the ends is important .it helps keep your hair healthy .do this on a regular basis .my name is sylvia russell .this is the hair studio , and this is how you can trim your hair .
how much does a personal trainer cost ?well , this depends .it depends on your location .it depends on who your personal trainer is .it depends on the facility that you 're at , and it also depends on if your personal trainer is coming to where you are at -- so an at home personal trainer .if you 're going to have somebody come to your house and train you , this is going to be a little bit more costly .if you 're going to go to a gym and have a personal trainer train you , this is probably going to be a little bit more cheaper than having someone come to your home , because you 're going to the facility to get trained .it also depends on the trainer .are you looking for a specific type of training ?are you looking for just overall training ?are you looking for someone that has extensive background and has a degree ?are you looking for someone that has a certification ?well , if the person has a certification and a degree , and also has a lot of experience , they 're going to cost more than somebody that does n't have any three of these things .so , for example , let 's say that you were living in a large city .if you 're living in a large city , the personal training cost is going to be up a little. [CLS] [SEP]b. [CLS] [SEP]it , as opposed to if you 're living in a town , it 's going to be a little bit cheaper .let 's say you walk into a facility. [CLS] [SEP]and it has a weight room .it has free weights , it has a free motion machine , it has an aerobics studio , it has lots of balls , it has the stability balls , it has the bosu balls .if you are in an area that allows you to use all these things , personal training is going to cost a little bit more , as opposed to if you go into a gym. [CLS] [SEP]that 's limited and only has a couple free motion machines .let 's say it has just a couple weights , it has one or two pieces or cardio equipment .it 's going to be a little bit less to have a personal trainer in this area .and from my experience of working in a gym , i have come to the conclusion. [CLS] [SEP]that for working with a personal trainer it roughly costs about forty dollars an hour on average .
this segment is on long drives and there are three basic power sources in the swing , the hands , the arms and the body .and when you could use all three together in coordination , and use all three at their maximum in coordination , for example , i could use my hands. [CLS] [SEP]but i could also use them with their maximum power .what a difference .i could use my arms , but now i 'm going to use my arms hard .i could use my body , but now i 'm going to use my body with some force .when you could use all three , hard , with coordination , that 's when you will hit to your full potential .is it difficult to use all three and hit that ball with the club head moving towards the target while facing the target ?yes , it 's hard .it 's not easy to hit a ball long and straight .but what more could you do ?hands , arms and body , and all three hard .i got the feel of it on that last one .that went significantly further than the others .but hands , arms and body .learn how to use each one alone .learn how to use them together and then learn how to use all three hard , with timing , and you 'll hit your longest drives .
s a really good place to get good , accurate registration .we 've got a couple test pieces here .the way you use a biscuit joiner is you 're connecting two pieces .we 're going to connect these perpendicular to one another because we 're going to have a box that 's going to be connected like that on all sides .so what you 're going to want to do. [CLS] [SEP]is you 'll put the two pieces the way you want them connected. [CLS] [SEP]and so you get them lined up. [CLS] [SEP]and then you make a mark on each board that corresponds to one another .as you can see here , we 've got the pencil mark that is lining up to one another .you do n't have to worry about being super dead on , as long as they 're very close , the biscuit joiner has a little bit of ,the slot that it cuts is bigger than the actual biscuits. [CLS] [SEP]so you 've got adjustment side to side , so you do n't have to worry about being super accurate on this as you do with other joinery which makes it a good economical alternative .you just kind of go make a bunch of quick marks and then cut the joints .once you 've made your mark , what you 're going to do is you 're going to cut the first one here where the actual board is going into the other board .you can cut that joint first .then on the second one , what you 're going to do is , or what i like to do is put on a little piece of 150 grit sandpaper below the joiner so that when you joint it , the jointer 's slightly raised. [CLS] [SEP]and so when you go to put these together , this board is just ever so slightly proud of this board .when you can come after later after the glue up , you can just wrap that flush to this surface with the router and a flush trim bit and get a nice , perfectly even plane between these two boards because with the biscuit joiner having a little bit of room to slide in there , you do n't want this board proud of this one. [CLS] [SEP], that 's a much bigger problem .but if you can get this board just slightly proud of that one with the little sandpaper trick , it makes it a lot easier for really good accurate results .ok , we 've got the biscuit in this slot here .we take the other board and we put it on , a little drive through here. [CLS] [SEP]and i do n't even know if you can pick up , but this board is just ever so slightly proud of that board. [CLS] [SEP]and we can easily take care of that with the router and a flush. [CLS] [SEP]trim bit and get really good results because like i said , the other way , if this board were to come out proud of this one , it can make for a situation where it can just make for a real uneven joint and it ?s a lot harder to deal with that than it is with this .this is going to make for really good accurate results and is a good little trick to employ when you 're using biscuits to do perpendicular joints like this .
ok we 've moved our rice to the back burner and you can see that it 's starting to get a little bit warm. [CLS] [SEP]so we are going to go. [CLS] [SEP]make sure that all of our chunks of veggie stock is broken up and that the butter is incorporated .so while we are waiting for that to go , we are going to take our cucumber. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to run it under some cold water .we are going to go ahead and slice off the ends .and then we are going to go and peel it .and we are going to discard the skin .and now our rice is starting to boil .so we are going to go ahead and cover that and reduce the heat down to about three and let it simmer .
alright , as you can see , the cream has reduced nicely .it 's taken on a really nice color .i 'm going to turn the heat down to low .what we need to do is add our final ingredients .so , we 'll add in the tomato and the green onion .mix .that ?s looking good .see , like i said with the shrimp topping. [CLS] [SEP], it 's , with the sauce , this just adds to the meal so much .so , a four or five ounce piece of tuna is plenty when you have this sauce on top .so , let 's have a taste. [CLS] [SEP]and we will adjust accordingly for seasonings .looks good .there 's so much flavor there. [CLS] [SEP], i do n't need any salt , any pepper .everything 's right there .i can taste so much seafood .i can taste the essence of the seafood .the basil comes through really nice .the green onions and tomatoes very subtle .what i will do is add a little bit of butter to finish this off .you know , butter , cream ,well , you know , this is n't the low cholesterol meal .it 's very tasty however .we have our cream , our shellfish , our tuna , butter .you know , sometimes you just have to go for it .and , if you 're going to go for it , this is the way to roll .this looks good .what the butter does , it adds a nice sheen .it thins it down a little bit , but it gives it a nice sheen .almost like silk .now the sauce is done .now that this is done , let 's roll on the tuna and the spaghetti , cucumber spaghetti .
now , you can get kids involved in everyday things like walking to the mailbox , they 'll love that .or , you would be surprised how many kids love to clean .give them a vacuum or a broom. [CLS] [SEP]and they 'll go to town , or give them some glass cleaner and a rag and tell them to try to reach the top of the glass door .they 'll have fun doing that .if you like to walk the dog , take your kids with you .it 's great to have a dane party .cut on some music and go crazy , kids will love it .this is a great time to explore sports with kids .if you have a certain one that you like to play , have them play it with you .like we said before , basketball is a great sport .some kids like football , some like soccer , it really does n't matter what they 're doing as long as they are doing something .plan an active birthday .everybody 's got them once a year , make it outside at the local park , or go to a roller skating rink , or if you 're really brave , you can take them to an ice skating rink .the main focus is that it really does n't matter what you 're doing as long as you 're up and active .
alright. [CLS] [SEP]so what that entails is triplets , patterns of three , three plus three equals six. [CLS] [SEP]but that has no relevance to anything right now .alright. [CLS] [SEP]so what we 're going to be doing is we 're going to be doing the boogie shuffle. [CLS] [SEP]and now we 're going to be adding in triplet fills with eighth note triplets .one triplet , two triplet , three triplet , four triplet. [CLS] [SEP]alright. [CLS] [SEP]so here we go one , two ,everything else is still the same two , ready go .
a lot of people put up fliers , you know the typical music teacher flier with the poster with the little tabs that you pull off .you can do that. [CLS] [SEP]but , you know what , everyone does that in a simple word document .why not do something a little cut above the rest ?this is what i do myself , and it 's a flier , and it 's color on both sides , and i make it look exciting and jazzy and different , and this is better than your average poster , and i 've gotten so many great responses just because i had a good looking flier .i hired a graphic designer. [CLS] [SEP]and i went that little extra mile .so really put a little thought into advertising .this is how you get your clients .lastly , takelessons.com is a great resource and they can get you students as well .so be creative , be resourceful .
sometimes , one of the body language behaviors you do not want to exhibit are what i call `` closed body behaviors , '' especially if you 're going on a job interview or if you 're trying to impress someone .closed body behaviors mean many things .sometimes , it means you 're just really uncomfortable with that person that you 're with or you do n't like them .they also mean that you lack self-esteem in yourself. [CLS] [SEP]so you 're a bit uncomfortable with who you are. [CLS] [SEP]and you do n't want that person to know too much about you .they can be misinterpreted though sometimes .sometimes , someone is just cold in a room , so again , you have to take into account the situation and the environment. [CLS] [SEP], what 's going on that particular social situation .so if someone is doing this , they might just be cold .as natalie and josh are showing you , closed behavior is going to appear in many ways .now sometimes , we use closure to place barriers in front of our bodies .as you see , natalie has her arms crossed .her legs are crossed away from josh as well .that primitively , this is to defend ourselves from attack , but in this day and age there are many reasons why we do this kind of body behavior .also , we may tuck our chins downward .we may hunch ourselves reducing the size of our target .we may , like i said , protect ourselves by folding our arms , crossing our legs away .we also may shift our head back from the other person and not really look at them directly .josh is trying to get some kind of communication going here with natalie .he 's trying to communicate that to her. [CLS] [SEP]but she 's showing him that she 's really not really interested .she 's averting her glance from him .she 's closed up .she 's uncomfortable .she 's shaking her leg a little bit .many times people do this to comfort themselves when they 're uncomfortable with the person they 're with .keep in mind also that closed body behavior sometimes mean that individual is not comfortable with themselves. [CLS] [SEP]so do n't assume when someone is exhibiting the closed body behavior that they 're not comfortable with you .many times they 're not okay with who they are , so do n't go negative on them and assume that if they 're closing up they may have low self-esteem .
to start off , we 're going to need 1 cup of shortening .we have our half cup measuring cup here .we 're going to go ahead and dump this .make sure to get all of it .we 're going to need one more half cup .same thing .we 're going to measure it off and pour it right in there .put the shortening to the side .now we 're going to need 2 teaspoons of vanilla .1 and 2.at this point , we start it on low and just mix it in .turn it up step by step .at this point , we 're going to go ahead and scrape it from the sides and turn it back on .
now listen , eyelashes are all the rage , and everybody is wearing them .so , whether you do them at home or you go to a professional , eyelashes are sure to give your eye that great big bang you need when you 're goin ' out .so , first things first ; you got to have your essentials .you want to make sure you have your eyelashes , and these come in all different types of sizes .you can get long , medium , short .use whatever is best for your eye .you want to make sure and have your eyelash glue .and this is a water , a waterproof product that you can use , so you do n't have to worry about tearing up , or water getting in your face and your eyelashes coming off .you also want to make sure and have a good pair of tweezers .these are essential when applying your eyelashes .so , the first thing you want to do is analyze the eye , and go ahead and take one of the eyelashes off your tray .dip it into the glue like so , and then , you simply attach it to the base of the lash like so , very easy to do .now , if you 're doing this on yourself you want to make sure and have a steady hand .you want to make sure and have some products in front of you , like some water and some , maybe some antiseptic in case you do get something in your eye .but you simply take your time , apply it directly to the lash line , and you 'll let that glue dry .now again , this is something that is very easy to do , so make sure you practice at home .get some girlfriends and have a eyelash night .practice putting on eyelashes .you can use the strips , you can use the individuals , whatever is best for your eye .my name is sylvia russell , and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]sure you 'll look like a superstar real soon .
now time for the last step of the smoked salmon canape -- the smoked salmon , of course .get a nice big , thick piece , and just sort of drape it on top .and it 's kind of nice the way that it gives you a little bit of height , and if you want , you can even put -- on a flatter piece i 'll show you .if you want to put less smoked salmon , here are a couple of different options you can do here .either the height , sort of casual look like that .or if you want a more flattened look , but do n't feel like it 's quite complete by itself , grab some capers which go very well with smoked salmon .garnish with a few of those , that 's another option .get a couple more .do you want to get some close-up stuff ?do a row of taller ones , and just cut the salmon as you need to .and for these last two we 'll do some flat pieces .a few more capers .you could also drape a long strand of red onion on top , would be really nice .i 'm going to push these down to get really cozy beside one another , because i 'm going to cut a few pieces of lemon , so those people who like a little squeeze can go ahead and do so .you do n't want to squeeze it right away on top of the salmon because it will actually start to change the color of it -- the acidity of the lemon .just so that you keep some kind of uniform look .there you go , your platter 's done , and that 's ready to take to a table i think .
now i 'm adding six cups of water , i have already put 4 cups of water in here .i 'm going to add 2 more cups of water .now i 'm going to add 2 cups of beans .the reason why you do n't want to add to many beans compare to your 6 cups of water is because these beans are going to expand .not right away. [CLS] [SEP]but we are going to dump the 2 cups of black beans that we are just hard rock beans into the 6 cups of water .then i take my pressure cooker lid , lock it into place. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to turn it on high .i 'm going to wait until this pressure starts to build and that is the first step on how to use a pressure cooker .
when you go to an outfitter to get some boots , it 's a really good idea to have them measure your feet .you might have an idea of what size you are , but it helps the person there who is going to fit you for boots or shoes , to have an idea of the dynamics of your foot ; not necessarily just the size .so they 'll use a device like this , which is called a brannock .on the brannock , they 'll have you place your foot , and then they have three measurements that they 're going to take .first measurement will be the toe to heel , measured here .they will look down and see what size your foot is , total lengthwise .they 'll also grab your toes and they 'll bend them up , and find out where the ball of your foot is .they 'll slide this to match where your toes bend , and they 'll look over here to see what size that is .they 'll take the larger of the two .sometimes , if you have really short toes , your ball-to-heel length might be longer than your toe-to-heel .the place in the shoe. [CLS] [SEP]-- there 's a certain place where the ball is supposed to be , and your toes bend , and so you want that to be correct .this right here is giving you idea of width , and so they can pick the correct shoe which will match you both lengthwise and also widthwise .if you have any questions , definitely give your outfitter a call .
this is the part that 's. [CLS] [SEP]we 're just going to string through it , so you want to do your other one before you start stringing anything through .you 're going to do the same part on this one .it 's always a good idea to measure again .and then start sewing again .okay , and that 's when you have this other one .
in this segment we 're going to be talking about the miscellaneous boxing equipment , not the major stuff that you normally wound find in the gym as requirements , such as the boxing ring , and the heavy bags , and the speed bags .but , today we 're going to be dealing with a lot of the individual , miscellaneous equipment .and , we 're going to be talking about everything from the actual heavy bag gloves , used on the heavy bags , to sparring gloves .we 'll talk about the differences and why one should be used for sparring and why one should only be used on the heavy bag .we 're going to be covering the different types of head gears .there 's sparring head gears. [CLS] [SEP]and then there 's competition head gears , and the two can not be mixed there either .we 're also going to be talking about the different kinds of mitts .so , we work on the focus mitts .there 's a coach 's mitt that 's used to actual punch the boxer back if he leaves his hands down .there are smaller micro mitts .we 're also going to be talking a little bit about punch shields , some ab rollers , and we 're going to get into a little bit more detail about the mouth pieces .make sure they 're form fitted ; the difference between the youth mouth piece and the adult mouth piece .so , as we go along , we 'll be doing a little bit more detail on each one of these things .
and again on this side ... [CLS] [SEP]folding to the middle crease and firmly creasing that .now you have sort of a triangular tie-looking thing and you 're going to fold the whole thing down so that the tip will be about 3/4 of an inch from the tail .so this section right here is 3/4 of an inch and you 're folding down there .you 'll want to crease that pretty firmly here .ok ?so , we 've just taken our tie-looking thing and folded it down so that our tip is 3/4 of an inch from the end of the tail .and then to make the head , we 're going to fold down about 3/4 of an inch to the head .and that 's the way you could send your swan in an envelope ...just like that , flat .but you 'll need to tell the recipient that , to open it , they must first fold it in half , like this .and then grasp the. [CLS] [SEP]... [CLS] [SEP]pinch the bottom section ... [CLS] [SEP]and grasp the next section and just pull it up like this .then pinch the bottom and pull up the head the same way , pinching .and there 's your beautiful swan .
now i 'm going to start working a little bit more on our vase in the background which is a woven pattern of greens and browns .but if i really look at those greens and browns , the browns in some places are almost red .in some places the browns are almost gray .so let 's see if we can get some of those colors that i 'm seeing .the very , if you look at the very front of that top rim of that vase , and i 'm noticing that i can see this inside of the vase slightly which is wrong in my drawing , but. [CLS] [SEP]this front edge is very much almost a pure red .and then it fades to more subtle grays and browns .so i 'm going to start by adding that red. [CLS] [SEP], there 's a brighter area on one side and because we are working light and dark , let 's add a little bit of that and help establish that shadow that i see on this far edge with a darker brown over here .and this brown extends this way .and let 's go ahead and correct the drawing with an area that does appear to have a little bit of blackness to it .this is only the second place that we 've used black in this whole drawing .and it 's being used just to establish the inside of that pot .what 's visible from where i sit .
it 's really , really , really expensive .in fact , for a gallon of canola oil , we 're running almost $ 4.25 a gallon .i do n't know about you. [CLS] [SEP]but that 's a little bit more than diesel fuel right now .however , it makes great biodiesel and in fact , most of the commercial biodiesel made in the united states today is made from new oil .used oil , cheap ,cheap , cheap .however , you 've got to go out and collect it instead of driving to the store and getting it .now , i want to show you what the difference looks like .first and foremost , when you make biodiesel , both will make biodiesel but new vegetable oil is always going to be easier to make .notice how much clear -- let 's get a shot of that , how clear that is .this is waste vegetable oil .this is oil that came from a restaurant .kinda gross , kinda nasty , kinda smells like it .but we can still make biodiesel from it .however , the gel point of the biodiesel made from the new oil is a little bit high -- lower than biodiesel made from used oil .so , you can make it from either one , it depends on what your pocket book is like .i recommend you use vegetable oil .
okay , i put this -- in here now , we can see , more or less , what 's going on .now , you have to see the proportions. [CLS] [SEP]and you try to copy the movement of these dancers .you know , we 're not going to copy exactly any dancers here but more or less the style .you can see this kind of .there 's this kind of attitude .let 's see if we can copy that .this one is good , this is black and white , very difficult to see .but anyway , we will try .then i 'm going to make like a shape here of man 's body .like it fits there more or less .oh , it 's a fantastic dancer , this guy .oh my god .fred astaire and ginger rogers. [CLS] [SEP].i try to put him in a tuxedo , too .we have to put more material here because the thickness of the chest .i mean , you have to keep working on the proportions that you want to keep in the figurine model , you know .then , the position of the arms-they are very important and the position of the body as well .the body has to be leaning on her , the body in that case .normally , the sculptors , what they do when they try to do that , they make like two naked figures .and then they try to dress them up later .we are going to do the reverse way we are just making the dress first. [CLS] [SEP]and then we have the time to fill them up with some kind of nice personality inside .this is not going to be a high detailed thing. [CLS] [SEP]but this is going to be good enough .okay , now , we 're going to start putting the arms .the arms , they are going to be loose for its --
hi , this is yolanda vanveen , from vanveenbulbs.com .and in this series , we 're learning all about how to identify our spring blooming flower bulbs .one of my favorite tulips is princess irene .it 's another two tone , that is just the most ultimately beautiful tulip in your yard .and i could just spend hours looking at them because there 's no two. [CLS] [SEP]are the same .and the way that the burgundy and the orange kind of mixes together , it 's like someone just barely took a paint brush and painted them .they kind of have a little bit of a feather look to them as well .and they kind of have all different colors in them .the insides actually has a yellow center .and then they almost have a more of a bronze to an orange as they fade out to the ends .so they pretty much cover almost all of the sunset colors , which i think are beautiful .hibiscus do that as well .and i just think the vibrant orange , again , i love oranges in the garden in the spring .there 's very few orange in the spring .there 's lots in the summer , you always have day lilies , and lilies , and all types of orange flowers .but in the spring , there 's very little orange .and when i see this orange in the spring , it makes me realize that summer is going to come .and it will warm up , and that i can enjoy these flowers until my summer flowers bloom .next , we 'll talk about a different traditional spring blooming flower bulb .the muscari , or grape hyacinth .
now we are going to discuss how to remove a tick from your pet .the first thing to know about removing a tick from your pet is make sure that it is a tick .there are lots of lumps and bumps on our animals sometimes that may look like a tick and actually are n't so make sure that that is what that is .they are little small insects with legs .they are generally going to be attached to the skin and be dark brown to black in color .ticks generally just attach at the head through the skin .they do have barbs on their heads. [CLS] [SEP]and so they are actually quite difficult sometimes to just easily grab and remove. [CLS] [SEP]and so you want to have some sort of instrument like a tweezer or. [CLS] [SEP]if you 've got good fingernails. [CLS] [SEP]sometimes that helps .what you want to do is identify where that tick is and grasp at the head of that tick , not the body , and at the head and then gently with firm type motion , remove it .make sure you 're not grabbing the skin and make sure you get the entire head .if the head is left in the body it can cause a little local infection and sometimes turn to abscesses .
the difference between cartoon voice over and like regular voice over like narration or commercials is that in cartoon voice overs you have to do a lot more animated takes , so you have to put a lot more character in it. [CLS] [SEP], you have to , you get to explore more , there 's probably more humor. [CLS] [SEP], there 's probably more drama and in sort of straight on voice over. [CLS] [SEP]it 's either a narrative. [CLS] [SEP]or you know you 're narrating something. [CLS] [SEP], you are doing a commercial , it 's kind of like your own voice .where as in cartoon voice overs you can do many , many characters in cartoon .so it 's more lively and fun. [CLS] [SEP]i think to do animation and most people that do straight , straight voice overs aspire to do animation. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's definitely a more sought after field in the voice over field. [CLS] [SEP]cause it 's so much fun to do .the other thing about doing cartoon animation voice overs versus regular voice overs is that you know obviously you get to be a different person when you do animation voice overs. [CLS] [SEP]so you know you can be an eighty year old woman or you can be a four year old kid .in straight animation you 're basically they are hiring you for your voice. [CLS] [SEP]and you sound just like your voice. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's about it .so it 's you get a little more diversity in a cartoon voice over .
these next exercises we are going to perform are the lunges with arm combinations .now go to your pantry and grab whatever you have .you might have bottles of water in there. [CLS] [SEP]or you could have canned items .now i know you have got mustard greens in there. [CLS] [SEP]so grab those .we have water bottles that are equivalent to 20 ounces so that could be 1/25 pounds and as long as you are performing the exercise properly with great technique you are going to really feel this entire work out. [CLS] [SEP]so your entire body is involved in a lunge .you are going to step forward , lunge down to where both knees are at 90 degrees and then come up half way and push back and then alternate , step down , halfway , push back .now if you want the entire body involved , go ahead and add some bicep curls to this , step down , curl and push up .you can do lateral raises and push up so whatever you think to do with the arms you can do that as well so lunges with water bottles doing arms. [CLS] [SEP]and you have got a great work out there with your total body .
another particularly useful knot around the campsite , is the timber hitch .this is usually used to bring , move timber around that you might want to use for a campfire , or if you need to build like a lean-to , or a structure of some sort .anyway , to begin tying this knot , you start just like we have with the other hitches , just by going under.it would be a log in this case , and then you take it over this way , and wrap the loop around , like so .then you just take this end , and go around several times .three or four. [CLS] [SEP]usually does the trick , and then you have your timber hitch , and it works much better on rougher surfaces , such as logs or wood , but you can kind of see how it works , and it 's a really simple knot to untie .you just kind of pull it apart , and it falls right off .
now we are going to go through and walk some bebop on the bass .now the thing about bebop is you are going to be doing a lot of fast runs. [CLS] [SEP]and we have a seven note scale .but the problem is we are playing in four all the time. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to need an eight note scale to end up on the one again .so you 'll see here is our problem , one , two , three , four , five and two , one , two , three , four , one , two , three , four , one ,see i had to play the g twice .to get to the g on time with enough intervals in between you want to make a eight note scale , so i 'm going to throw a chromatic note in there .i 'm going to throw the third fret on the third string. [CLS] [SEP]so we start , see how i ended right on the one .( playing guitar ) one , two , three , four , one , two , three , four , one , two , three , four , one , two , three , four , one , you can just also bounce back and forth in the scale to kind of postpone of getting to the one .( playing guitar ) one , two , three , four , one , two , three , four , one , two , three , four , one , two , three , four , one .again a lot of bebop cats like to use those chromatic notes in between the scale and really assigns you to land on one at the appropriate time .the notes in between really do n't matter as much ( playing ) .that is a basic bebop approach to the bass starting on g .
now if you really are serious about your craft and you 're not going to have a record label doing all of your booking , all of your stuff for you that needs to be handled , you 're probably going to need to find your own agent .the reason for that is , you can book yourself , but you just ca n't promote yourself very effectively .if you have somebody else doing it for you it always looks better .now there 's some things that you want to look out for in trying to find your own agent .the first thing , probably the most important thing that you want to find is somebody that you trust and that really believes in what you 're doing .if they do n't believe in what you 're doing , they 're not going to work that hard for you .if they love what you 're doing , they will go to the ends of the earth to make sure you that you are successful , because they 're invested in making you successful .now having experience in the industry is a real plus .if you can find somebody that has all sorts of connections and all sorts of ways to get you into shows that you could never get into on your own , that 's really awesome because that kind of person is going to take you over the top .now , having heard that , that kind of person 's probably also going to cost more than somebody else .having an incredible motivation and great desire can a lot of times be a substitute for having great connections .so if you can find somebody who really believes in you. [CLS] [SEP]and they 've got talent. [CLS] [SEP], you can train them and you can show them how to book shows for you in the best possible manner , so make sure that you find somebody that you can trust , make sure that you have somebody that 's going to be a hard worker .all those character traits that you really would want in someone watching over your kids. [CLS] [SEP]are the same kind of character traits that you want for someone watching over your precious art .
hi , my name is cristy nix with stoneblessings.com .today we 're talking about the 7 energy centers of the body , or the 7 chakras .right now we 're talking about the heart chakra , which is located in the center of your chest .and it governs physically your heart , blood circulation , as well as your lungs , and your arms and your hands .it is vibrant , vibrant grass green , very clear green .and it is represented by the 12 petal lotus , and it 's symbol , basic symbol is the hexagon .now this energy body , specifically is your heart , it is unconditional love of self and others , and deals with compassion , and how you feel about things , very much your emotional self .there 's several stones that support this body .they are rose quartz of course , which i think it 's the most common .and it is very much a warm hug , so to speak .it 's a beautiful pink color , light pink color .and i think of this chakra , since it 's green typically in most chakra demonstration , but i think of it more as watermelon tourmaline , where it 's green on the outside , and then pink on the inside ; so pink is definitely represented here .and then adventuring , which is a great green color , which very much helps in growth and nurturing , and then moss quartz , or tree moss ,i 'm sorry , tree moss agate right here , which is very much nurturing and growing things as well and very much a grounding of heart , to keeping you centered in the earth .now one wonderful thing is , by being aware of this chakra , and knowing that it is out of balance , you could be of having breathing problems , like asthma , or having , seems like emotional crisis , it 's very good to sit back and ground actually in your heart .so that everything that comes out of your heart is done in love , versus being so up in your mental body to where you actually are thinking about things , you 're wrapping your mind around things , but the things that are coming out are almost forced , and there is n't any true energy positively supporting them .so having a health and healthy heart chakra , will keep you doing all things out of love .
this exercise is called couch squats .this is a great exercise that you can do not only through the commercial breaks , but you can do it throughout the show that you 're watching on t.v .so what you 're going to do is you 're going to pretend that you 're going to be a couch potato .but not really .you 're going to really build up those legs , build up those gluts , have great looking legs , so here we go .abs in tight , arms out , and. [CLS] [SEP]you 're going to stick. [CLS] [SEP]your rear end way back and just barely tap the couch with your rear end .and you 're going to squat way back and come up .so when you 're breathing , inhale as you come down , exhale as you come up .and this is really good to really pull up that derriere. [CLS] [SEP]and if you 're thinking about your abdominal muscles , you 're working those abs as well .lifting your arms up helps you to work those shoulders .so this is a great total body exercise doing these squats .and you 'll definitely take out that name couch potato .no more are you going to have those potatoes in your booty .they 're going to come right on out after you do those squats .so couch squats , go get them .
sometimes in dental offices , or professional stores , there are available these ...we 'll call them prefab , custom whitening trays .and what 's nice about these is that it does n't require a dental office visit to make custom trays .instead , it has soft , formable trays in there that already has the whitening gel in it .so there 's no guesswork as to how much whitening gel to put in or anything else .all it requires us to do is to take it out of the package and simply pinch it on our teeth .and by pinching it , what it will do is it will customize it and form it exactly to your bite .the nice part about this product is that the trays will actually get far back in an arch .so again , in talking about where the smile lines are , it will get far back to teeth , and it is only required to stay on your teeth for one-hour period of time .so that means that your commitment to this whitening process is not all that great .and most people can see their way through that .the biggest part about whitening is to maintain that commitment though .because many people go into whitening wanting to whiten , and then get home and find that they really did n't have that time to create or donate for it .so you want to find the best treatments that are right for you .in this case , that one hour , you take it off , you throw it away , the next day you go back. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to whiten again , you would need to have enough to maintain that whitening process .
in this clip , we 're going to re-install the back plate .i 'll just get her lined up. [CLS] [SEP]and she how she 's looking here .she needs to come over just a little bit .now i 'm putting the back plate on , just getting the breather bolts started .make sure you use blue lock tight on these , because you do not want these backing out and going in there .it 'll destroy your engine .do n't tighten them to much , this is a plastic backing .probably like eight pounds .
here to talk about adaptive sports , and how snowshoeing can fit in with a lot of people ’ s adaptive life .so , going up an incline , very important to take smaller steps and keep the weight over the balls of your feet , and just , just like climbing a set of stairs but also be aware to keep that athletic stance. [CLS] [SEP]so you do n't have these snowshoe overlap .so , here 's a good example of going up an incline .when you 're going up an incline , especially with a group , it 's very important to keep distance between each individual , so if one person does lose their balance and fall backwards , we 're not playing dominoes .but , as you 're starting the incline always make sure to remind them stay on the balls of their feet , o.k , and just like going up a set of steps , o.k , they just lean forward. [CLS] [SEP]and they keep the weight on the balls of their feet , and avoid the falling back because that 's what can cause them to fall down the incline .coming down , you 're going to want to keep your weight a little further back , still over the balls of your feet .make sure you 're giving the grips , the claws and the bottom of the snowshoes a chance to grab the snow , as you extend down .
in this step , we 're going to take a look at how to play the cowbell while holding it .most of the time , i would say if you have to hold something and play it with another hand , that you would hold it in your weak hand and play it with your dominant hand .so i 'd be playing this with my right hand .but that does n't feel as comfortable to me as this way , which is holding it in my right hand and playing with my left hand .now , there 's different tones on the cowbell .that 's the big , thick nice sound .then you can also have a thinner , higher pitched sound .and that 's just in between .you do n't really ever want to play on the side of the cowbell .it 's just not there .now , this yellow piece is called a ridge rider .and the reason why that is on there is because you 're supposed to play that cowbell like this , and the ridge rider protects the cowbell from bending and breaking .i do n't like it though because it restricts being able to play up here , so i flip my cowbell over .and as you can see , playing on the non -- the side without the ridge rider , has bent .but , i can hit it on the --i can , i just have more flexibility in that way .so , when you hold it , you hold it , and then you also , you hold the to where the opening is kind of out to the crowd .that 's where the sound is going to go .and you do n't need to crush it .you do n't need to play this thing as hard as you possibly can , because the sound of this carries very well .so , that is how you play the cowbell while holding it .
but little kids might not make that association. [CLS] [SEP]so the difference between material for adults and material for kids is quite large .when i do a kids show and there are adults in the audience i always throw in a few jokes for the adults. [CLS] [SEP]because why not ?the party and the show is for everybody , not just the kids .but frequently kids will be afraid of clowns , so if i walk into a room and a child starts to cry , i quickly look at the other children and say , `` is anybody else going to cry , raise your hand '' no one else wants to raise their hand and admit that they are going to actually cry .but sometimes adults are afraid of clowns too , or just say , `` i do n't like clowns '' .and then i just look at them and say , `` i do n't like clowns either ....they. [CLS] [SEP]taste funny '' or make up your own bit .
with this exercise we 're going to show how to work the inside part of the thigh , where gravity likes to take its toll .it 's also good muscle for various sports such as skiing , anything that you 're going to use against gravity to take off with and apply force .so we 're going to extend the top leg and with one hand above and below the knee joint , this is resistance and try this without resistance first. [CLS] [SEP]and then you can have your partner press against as you try to push your leg down , push down on your leg , and then resist up and down .and resist up , you do n't want to go any higher then the hip .so you focus that work load right on the inside thigh .another way would be to take the bottom leg and extend that out , bend this one behind you and as your partner lifts and lowers the front leg , you 're resisting again above the knee joint on the right there on the inside thigh .make sure your partner has their hip stacked , head in line with the spine .and you 've got a nice contraction in your abs to support your back .go ahead and lift and lower .and just lift and lower the leg and. [CLS] [SEP]with each contraction you 're applying passive resistance .eight to ten reps for beginners , ten to twelve and up beyond to fatigue , working the inside thigh , either the bottom leg or the top leg with resistance .
it 's again , a very difficult , you need a lot of strength to get this pose done , but we can use some assist from your strap .what you need to do is you 're going to belt your arms , but you want to do that just above your wrists , just above your elbows .the strap is going to support your whole body .so if you come over , lengthening , start to bend your elbows , and put all your weight on that strap is how you can get this pose done , and maintain this pose .you 're pressing through your heels , you 're lengthening out the crown of your head ; from the top of the pubis bone through the sternum , through the neck is all being drawn in .learning to breathe ; see what 's going on in your body .if you 're lucky enough to have somebody else support this pose , as she 's supporting the upper body with that strap , i can now support her lower body , and she can go ahead and straighten out her legs , drawing the stomach in .and again , my knees are soft. [CLS] [SEP], i have the strap looped , my arms are straight .i 'm really doing no work .let 's go ahead , and release the pose .lengthen your spine ; there you go .
in this clip we are going to be going over how to combo your fan kick .what we did today in doing our combo is you can do whatever you want after it .we are just going to go ahead and do a basic aerial .to look really good. [CLS] [SEP]you do your double leg and land. [CLS] [SEP], you step out , bam into an aerial and that looks really nice. [CLS] [SEP]or you just step out and go into a regular punch .alright. [CLS] [SEP]so let 's go ahead and break that down in how to step down and go into our other techniques or moves that we want to do .alright. [CLS] [SEP]let 's go ahead and do our fan kick , bam , jump double leg , over. [CLS] [SEP]and we just landed .from here we are going to step backwards , do a 180 turn and jump straight into an aerial .o'kay. [CLS] [SEP]so one more time .step together , jump , here comes our fan kick .we are going to be landing , facing the same way that we jumped .as you land we are going to use that momentum , bounce , step back , turn around and go into your aerial .if you can you can always just step straight forward and most of the time you kind of lean back when you go into your fan kick. [CLS] [SEP]and you get some momentum going backward so as you land. [CLS] [SEP]you sometimes land facing back a little bit instead of completely sideways. [CLS] [SEP]so use that momentum and turn with it and jump straight into an aerial and everyone is like this .o'kay. [CLS] [SEP]so like i said you can do any type of combo you want .you can just land your fan kick and go into a punch or you can come out of it and do a kick. [CLS] [SEP]so remember you are going to come around and land , spin around , kick , go into an aerial or just step out and go into an aerial or a punch .try to always combo move. [CLS] [SEP]so it is not just doing one move and stopping. [CLS] [SEP]and then another move and stopping .you want to be able to keep going and that makes it look really nice especially for an overhand form or competition or for some shows if you like to dance , land and dance , go into some dance moves .o'kay. [CLS] [SEP]so that is going to be how to combo your fan kick .
how to care for a gray tree frog .caring for a gray tree frog is pretty easy .you 've just got to be disciplined about it .we just have our little enclosure here , we made in our earlier video .you can see our little gray tree frog hanging out in there .basically , what you have to do , is on a daily basis , you want to check the moisture level in there .make sure it 's nice and humid for him .again , tree frogs , and frogs in general , do n't drink water .they absorb it through their skin , so that 's why we 're not worried about having a water bowl in there .what we are going to do , is on a daily basis , is just take that out , and we can mist down the bedding , so that it 's nice. [CLS] [SEP]and moist.now. [CLS] [SEP], you kind of want to let that dry out in between mistings , so if you 're misting it , and in one day it 's not drying out , you may be misting it a little bit too much , or you need to give it more time , in between mistings .it does need to dry out every couple of days , in order to stop any kind of bacterial growth .another thing we can do , we can actually mist right up into here , for him , to give him a little bit of misting .be aware that if you 're doing that , and you have hard water , lots of minerals in it , you can cause mineral deposits on your plexiglas , and then you have to go in there and scrub it out and stuff , so. [CLS] [SEP]that can be kind of annoying , so that 's kind of your daily maintenance , and then once every couple of days , you can drop a cricket in there for him .make sure the cricket is appropriately sized .you never want to feed a feeder animal to a frog , that is bigger than the space between his eyes , so for that guy , that means no bigger than that or so. [CLS] [SEP], so we 're looking at like half inch crickets , or quarter inch crickets , for this little guy , and one to two every three to four days , is just fine for him , as far as upkeep away , and he will be more than happy in there , and you 'll have a nice little frog , to keep on your desk .
if you do n't have your own gear ; we 'll give it to you , for a price .the specific harness used at this gym is called the misty mountain jim dandy .this harness ; it 's not comfortable , but it does serve purpose .it 'll keep you on the wall .to put on this harness , you 're going to step through the leg loops that are already in place .once both legs are through , pull the harness up. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's in line with your waist .take the waist belt and wrap that all the way around you , passing it through the buckle next through the blue loop .your waist belt should be pretty snug to make sure you do n't fall out of it .once your waist belt is tightened , you 're going to do the final step that 's called doubling back .on this harness , there 's a safety feature that engraved danger on the buckle to make sure. [CLS] [SEP]you know it 's not double back .to make sure you do double your harness back , take the end of the strap , pass it back through the first loop and the buckle you put it through .finally , tighten your legs down by pulling the strap through the buckle .your leg should be snug but not too tight .last step , you have the leg strap here .this will prevent your leg loops from sliding down and becoming loose .i tuck that up and over the back of my harness and clip it behind my right leg .that 's how you put on a harness .
they have so much flavor and people make the mistake of running them underwater .you do n't have to do that .all you have to do is just take a wet paper towel .you do n't want to put mushroom under water .they have so much water .they actually get like water logged then break and you do n't want that .you want to keep that nice flavor .so i just take a paper towel and just wipe them down , like so .so do that to all your mushrooms .and believe me , we 're also going to use a lot of mushrooms in this one 'cause it 's great .you ca n't kill us with mushrooms .i love it .but again , if you do n't like mushrooms as much , maybe you should n't even be making this , but if you like mushrooms , definitely you want to go with as many different varieties .it gives it a lot of flavor to this beef stroganoff .all right , now that i got them all rinsed and cleaned down and wiped , let 's give them a good slice .my portabellas were already sliced , and if you can get mushrooms that are fresh and already sliced , this will make it a lot easier , but i tend to like to slice my mushrooms the length of the mushroom .so when you slice it , you 'll actually see like a mushroom piece which looks really nice , like so .so we 're going to just slice all of our mushrooms like this , even the shiitake. [CLS] [SEP], i 'll slice it long ways .and that 's all you want to do. [CLS] [SEP], you want to slice it only like that .and i 'm probably using a cup to a cup and a half of each of these mushrooms .the recipe calls for like 3/4 of a cup of each. [CLS] [SEP]but. [CLS] [SEP]like i said , i really love mushrooms. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm just going to add the extra .you 'd do it too if you like mushrooms .all right , we so gather our mushrooms all sliced .we 're going to just add them to our bowl , and i 'm going to take over our meat and our onion and our mushrooms and start to saute everything up in a little butter and olive oil .
hello , we 're going to be going ahead with the remains of the lower case alphabet .but before we do , i just want to touch the point that we 're going to be hitting these letters between guidelines .the guidelines are five times the height of the pens .so we 've measured out five pen widths .and we 're going to do the consonants , but here are the vowels just in case you have n't seen them , a ;e. [CLS] [SEP]; i , i tend to forget , o ; and u. [CLS] [SEP]writing in the italic style with the slight forward slant and then oval shape to the round letters .so we 'll be continuing in this way .we 're going to work within guidelines and we 're going to work carefully , breaking each letter into two strokes , sometimes more , so that we can control the direction and the shape of the pen mark .remember to keep the pen at forty five degrees , about here , in relation to the baseline .
to prepare our wooden base before we start , you 'll want to rough it up a little .it helps the tiles adhere to the surface .so , i have here something that i made .i just put nails into a board until they stick out .this is great for really gouging up a surface that needs to be mosaicked .so you just scrape it up , just all the surfaces that you will be mosaicking .the next step to preparing our wood base for the mosaic is to coat it with a layer of white glue and water .you 'll want to mix up 4 parts water to 1 part white glue and paint that over the entire surface where it will be mosaicked .then , you 'll want to let that dry thoroughly .this will seal the wood and so the grouting wo n't dry too fast because the wood often soaks up the liquid in the grout .so this will seal it so it wo n't soak up the liquid in the grout .it gives better adhering to the tile adhesive .so , you just coat that over completely and let it dry thoroughly .
bras are bras .as much as you might want to have some innovative design it is ultimately a bra .and not that i 'm trying to make you not want to be creative with it. [CLS] [SEP]but what i think of is bathing suit types .if it 's going to be a bathing suit , if it 's going to be a bra. [CLS] [SEP]i want it along the same sort of lines .i want my underwear that i design to be able to be worn madonna style , outside of the clothes and look good .i do n't want it to be just regular. [CLS] [SEP]so i always include some sort of design variation .such as the diagonals on this bra which makes it look kind of more swimsuit inspired .and with this bra i decided not to do any under wire shaping .it 's going to be all one piece .there 's no mid section .it 's a sports bra with a dip .a cross between a sports bra and then a regular bra bra .but it 's all one piece .so you start out with your shoulder straps .figure out what width you want them and where you want them .and since it 's all one piece you have and actual neckline .the chest part dips .figure out where you want it to dip .obviously in the middle of the chest .make sure it falls in the middle of the chest .and then create your cups .and then do your design variations .and there you go .
a good way to get used to using a bosu ball , that prioperceptive neuromuscular facilitation , is ... [CLS] [SEP]a lot of people just look at it and kind of stare at it , and then look at you like , `` what is it ? ''you get on there , and some people will do this , it 's one of the best ways to get used to your platform .we 've taken solid gravity out of the picture with the floor .now we 've got this force in here that 's going to make that kinetic chain move from head to toe .so , the best way , center yourself , back down .it 's just step up , step down .just like you would keep touching something to get used to it , basically you 're touching it with your feet .once you get your balance. [CLS] [SEP]and you 've got that prioperceptive kinetic chain moving. [CLS] [SEP], you can just do a little run up , get a little more aggressive , a little more brave with your step .it 's always good to switch lead feet , simple basic walks , so you get that cross-crawl mechanism going .again , you can pick it up , a little plyo for explosive .and then , the key is to practice stopping .a ton of sports. [CLS] [SEP]we 've got to stop on the dime :hockey being one of them ; football ; tennis a big one .you want to make sure that you 've always got your knee lined up with that hip joint. [CLS] [SEP]and you do n't got that obsessive lateral force on it .so you can practice coming down , coming up , hold , in a blocking pattern .come down , hold .come down , hold .try to anchor your feet on each side of that circle in the middle of the bosu .again , we 're going to leave our hands here by our center of gravity .we 're going to start with a slight bent position , and we 're going to do what was called 'stick it ' .again , explosive movement , we 're not going to leave the ball .we 're going to come up , stick it , hold .simple movement .looks easy , but you 've got to remember to fire from here to here , all the way down here .it takes some getting used to and everything 's going to want to come forward , gravity 's going to always want to pull you forward .you 're going to want to make sure you land right , shoulders over your hips .boom , stick it .boom , stick it .you can progress .you can go side-side , come down , come back up , and just keep doing it .you 'll get winded for sure .
and i 've got this weird english accent , but do n't let that fool you .i know how to perform , i love performing on stage , and. [CLS] [SEP]i 've had experience on how to sell so many cds , and that 's what i wanted to share with you .and anyway , i do n't know if you 've noticed but. [CLS] [SEP]the interesting thing is you talk to many artists , you ask them , `` how long did it take you to work on your album ? ''they 'll say , `` i do n't know , four months , nine months , a year . [CLS] [SEP]''`` how long did it take for you to work on your , i do n't know , on your actual song , the writing of the song ? ''`` oh , it took me three months , took me two years , ''whatever .now , i asked artists time and time again , `` how long do you spend on your stage performance ? ''i get three days , two days , one day .i 'm like , `` what ? ! ''it does n't make sense .it 's like you 're working on the most ineffective things .an artist will make 95 % of his revenue on stage !did you know that ?if -- you 're not a superstar unless you 're 5 % of the people in this world .you 're not a superstar. [CLS] [SEP]so i can safely say that the only way that you 're going to sell your cds is live on stage .so , why do you spend the least amount of time on stage ?okay , we need to spend more time on stage because that 's where you 'll sell your cds. [CLS] [SEP], that 's where you 'll make your money , baby ; that is where the money is made .spend more time on your shows .listening to what. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm talking about , if you want to hear some more about it , go on to www.alexboye.com , b-o-y-e.com .and also , go on to www.stagepresence.com. [CLS] [SEP]and it would tell you more and you can buy some of my videos so that you can see more and have more of an extensive understanding of what it is to perform on stage .you guys are awesome , make them love you on stage , perform ,do n't hide anything , do n't be scared , be confident and own the stage , and when you own the stage you own some serious cash .have a good time .enjoy yourself and enjoy performing .
hi , i 'm ann myrick and. [CLS] [SEP]today i 'm going to show you how to get organized .depending on what area that you 're organizing containers , file folders , having everything in a place and a place for everything is the most important .so , today we 're just going to talk about first. [CLS] [SEP], first we 're going to work with cleaning out , organizing , do we need it , do we not need it .because alot of times people have , why put paperwork and why put books , and why put things in baskets if you do n't even use them or need them .so , first what we want to do is go through and if we 're working on a desk. [CLS] [SEP], i mean working in the office or working in the bedroom , through out what we do n't use any longer or bag it up and take it to goodwill or take it to salvation army .once we have thrown out and cleaned out then it 's time to go through and organize .best way to organize is to contain everything .now there are just quantities of different ways , different containers , different ways that you can organize .these baskets are great for just using , throwing , if you have a table that has alot of books on it , you can use these baskets for organizing the books .so , instead of just seeing a whole bunch of books that are just thrown on a table you see an organized , nice basket. [CLS] [SEP]and then the books are inside .as far as finding interesting baskets , interesting ways to organize , labeling is also a good way to organize as far as on shelves using , if you have readers , using just words like `` supplies '' , `` paper '' , or if you have children that ca n't read , maybe even putting a picture on a shelf like a ball where all the balls are or a bat where all the bats are , something like that .those are different ways , different hints in how you organize .this is ann myrick and that 's how you organize .
in this clip we 'll speak about strategy a little bit .the three places of a triples game .the leads , the vice skips and the skips .the leads are to get their bowls , three of them , closest to the jack .the vice skip , the second person up in line , will also do that .he will try to nudge out an opponent , get closer , move the jack .but , the skips strategy is entirely different .he 's the boss of the game .he directs which way he wants you to bowl .he 'll also have to clean up any mess that his team has made .so , his strategy is if the opponents on the jack to get himself there instead , any way he can do it .
it 's something that they latched onto early on in the internet area .and they have been doing since .what they do here and. [CLS] [SEP]what other online manufacturers do also is you start with a blank shoe .nike has it where you can pick the color that you are going to want in the shoe .we 'll pick yellow .and then it takes you to the next part of customizing your shoe , building your shoe as they say .you can pick various colors and it will show you what it is like if you change it up .now we have it red and blue .you can even change the stripe down the middle. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's red , white and blue and have a shoe that is very american .bare in mind. [CLS] [SEP]you can really only do this at the manufacturers ' sites directly .this is n't something you can do on retailer 's sites .so be sure , if this is something you want , that one , it 's within your budget because it is more expensive and two , you are willing to wait 4-6 weeks for it to show up .
i have taken off my chain to demonstrate the beauty of knowing how to pick up momentum from the terrain that you are presented with .people call it pumping which means that you are finding the back side , finding the transition in every aspect of the trail , and making speed with it .so chain on my bike , starting here on the slight incline. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to make it up that hill with out pedaling .so i take off and just , i have manage to make it all the way of cross this flat section of trail and almost off that trail with no chain .by finding the down slope in the section of the trial and really driving my wheel into it .so not only does that help me generate speed it also helps me maintain control .so in times when i am turning or braking is when i 'm driving my bike into the ground .just really forcefully driving it into the ground to create traction .so there are times that you know that i have to brake traction to keep going quick .we would talk about that in a little bit .but the more you mountain bike the more you look at the trail that you are presented with , with a very critical eye .you see every small adulation there is a hole in the ground here before it goes down .so you want to get over the hole in the ground or push your bike through it , then i weight and get over the back side .so instead of just running into everything you can ride lightly on the bike except when it is going to create speed by pushing down .so as i start again to pump through this section you would notice a lot to. [CLS] [SEP]he exaggerate movements that i make with my upper body and my hips .so what i have done here you see it , it is dropping the chest down , dropping the knees down , and dropping the hips down when i had some back side and picking up the bike and actively unweighted it when it is going to be slowed down .so like around this corner. [CLS] [SEP]i do a little bit of a slide with my tire and also pick up the bike and put it down forcefully on the ground. [CLS] [SEP]so that 's the basic concept behind pumping terrain .
alright the drink we 're about to make is called a rum cobbler .let 's go ahead and put some ice in a glass. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to measure out our dark rum ,two ounces and. [CLS] [SEP]we 're going to add one teaspoon of super fine sugar .and let 's go ahead and shake those up , want to try and get that sugar dissolved in .alright , and a little bit more .o.k. [CLS] [SEP],and now we 're going to go ahead and put some ice in our glass here. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to strain that in , a nice sugary dark brown .and now we 're going to add three ounces of club soda and stir that up .and we 're going to garnish it with a lemon , a cherry and an orange slice .there we go , a rum cobbler .bottoms up .
so now we 're going to a add rhythm track to this .just to give us an idea of how to play and practice .keeping in mind , we 're playing the minor scale now .the one is minor , two is minor .one is minor , again .one is minor .this all is going to be major .when you come over to c. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's in the base and the root .it 's actually a flat , major .but c is in a root , just to compliment .so here we go .so if you 're lucky enough , as i was blessed to get this machine .or if you could borrow one .or even have a friend to play along with you .you can just play along with it .you can hold chords when you want to .or speed it up or slow it down .it 's all in playing and having fun .so i 'll that one more time .just holding the chord .here we go .and i was using the minor chord with the added attention , things .so i 'll play the beat , one more time .
so moving onto the grapes which is our last still-life fruit .i 'm actually going to use some purple and-but i wo n't use purple straight out of the tube .and you can make purple , or you can either buy purple in a tube , or you can use blue and red and you can get purple that way as well .so we 'll see which one turns out how we want it .so i 'm just going to take this brush here. [CLS] [SEP], take a little bit of the white right over here with the green and some purple .and it looks like my purple is having problems .so i 'm going to get a little bit of this blue here to mix with this -- and that made it really blue. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm going to go back to get some more purple and maybe a touch of black .and more purple , and i think we might have a great color purple .there we go .so now you can just loosely fill on these circles that we drew out .and i think i 'll get some of this .we 'll get a little bit more purple and mix this in together .i 'll need a little water .there we go .much better .okay , so i 'm just going to fill this in .and once you get all this filled in , you can go back to your -- you can go back to the white. [CLS] [SEP]and then you can just dab that. [CLS] [SEP]and you can kind of highlight. [CLS] [SEP]that it 's --they 're individuals and come in here to give it some depth .and that is painting the grapes .
next , let 's add a comping move before the little routine. [CLS] [SEP]we 've got going on here .what usually happens in a sabar solo circle , is the soloist enters the circle doing some sort of comping move that the drummer is echoing .they can do the move as much as they want , the drummer can then either give a break to sing on the beginning of the solo , or the dancer can simply go into the solo , and just be as possible about the intentions of what 's coming next , so that the drummer can echo it .so let 's pretend that our solo is going to start with our foot twisting move , that 's going to be our comping move , where going to do our foot twisting move on our way into the sabar circle .and if we want to count , and , 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 ; and 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 ; one more , 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ; now the jump , 1 ,2 ,3 and 4 , 1 and 2 and 3 and open , and crown .lets try the whole thing again .we 'll go into our circle with our comping move ; and 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 ; and 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 ; one more , 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 ; and 1 ,2 ,3 and 4 , 1 and 2 and 3 , up , 1 ,2 and 3.one more time , we 'll go over the whole thing counting it out ; and 1and 2 and 3 and 4 ; 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 ; last time , 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 , and then , 1 ,2 ,3 and 4 , 1 and 2 and 3 , 4 , 1 ,2 and 3.and that is our nice little combination that we can use as a solo into the sabar circle .
let 's try our folkloric shoulder drop rocking the body from side to side .let 's start with the feet. [CLS] [SEP]so we know where our weight is .so the feet are going to be just slightly apart .and we 're going to do this little down up down motion with the feet .now the knees are going to absorb some of that motion .and the accent is going to be on the down .you want to feel like you 're really heavy ,like you 'd really rather be on the ground. [CLS] [SEP]but you 're lifting just enough so that you can get to the other side .so the heels going to go down up down , down up down , down up down .good .make sure your belly button 's pulled in , your chest is lifted .good .now every time that the heel goes down , the shoulders going to go down .so you 're lifting in between two .so it 's , down and down , down and down , down and down , down and down .have the arms out to the sides away from your body .make sure the hands are n't moving with you here .make sure the body is n't moving with the head like this so much .but that , it 's moving a little independently .those shoulders are just moving under your chin and the knees are gently absorbing that downward motion .very good .and just rock from side to side .practice this in the mirror and make sure it looks very effortless .
for my purpose right now. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm doing the teapot this would be find .pop the clay down , it is not going to be in the center , so. [CLS] [SEP]the first step is you need to center the piece so that the clay so then you can work on the clay .okay to center the piece water is your lubricant always have to use water .so you start pushing the clay and start pushing it down at the same time pushing it into the center .speed up the kiln speed up the wheel. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm sorry pushing the clay up and down .clay going out here. [CLS] [SEP]you have to go pushing in harder .the center means the piece would be perfectly right in the middle of the wheel so that you have no movement on your hand .
hi. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm kelli .i 'm an aesthetician and makeup artist of ulta salon and cosmetics. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to talk to you a little bit about getting rid of forehead wrinkles .basically forehead wrinkles are caused from expressions so if she 'll just furrow her brow for me. [CLS] [SEP], you see how you 've got a lot of lines from that expression so doing that repetitively over time can actually break the collagen in your elastin within the layers of the skin and led to a permanent line or wrinkle .one thing that you can do is botox injections and those actually help to relax these muscles within the forehead. [CLS] [SEP]and you can get them any place on the face. [CLS] [SEP]but it helps relax the muscles that if you furrow your brow or scrunch up your face it is not going to basically make a crease within the skin. [CLS] [SEP]so it is going to help to relax those muscles and help to prevent expression lines from forming .if you ca n't afford botox or are intimidated by needles another thing that you can do is a topical form of botox which is the lifting product that has argireline in it which is the main ingredient in the botox injection .it also has peptide in it which gives an instant lifting and tightening effect so you do get instant results from it if you are troubled by deeper lines and wrinkles which she is not. [CLS] [SEP]but you can just pat a little bit on this area wherever you are concerned there is a line or a wrinkle and it is going to give you an instant smoothing and tightening effect. [CLS] [SEP]plus it is going to help to relax the expression lines. [CLS] [SEP]so if you do make a face during the day it is not going to crease. [CLS] [SEP]and it is not going to leave permanent creases in the skin. [CLS] [SEP]and it is not going to break your collagen in your elastin. [CLS] [SEP]so those are some things that you can do to get rid of forehead wrinkles .
the first thing you want to do is prepare your home for winter. [CLS] [SEP]is you want to go around and inspect your entire house .you want to make sure there 's no exposed areas where bugs and critters can get inside your house .you want to make sure that there 's no big holes , big gaping holes , on the roof , underneath the overhangs , at the bottom of the siding , down around your doors .there 's numerous areas where they can get in. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to make sure that you go ahead and repair all those items. [CLS] [SEP]so you do n't have a problem later .you also want to take care of your pipes .any of your faucets , outdoor faucets , you want to go ahead and wrap those .cover them up .they actually sell these little styrofoam covers that you can actually put over your hose bib and it 'll actually protect it from freezing .you also , you know , if you 've got a lot of plants of trees that are not , you know , they do n't handle up to the weather very well. [CLS] [SEP], you want to make sure that you wrap those accordingly , or actually drape plastic over them or any of those type of things .these are just some of the ways you can prepare your home for winter .
hello , my name is scott. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]the owner of climb on indoor rock climbing in wilmington , north carolina .today we 're going to discuss climbing harnesses .there are a multitude of different type of harnesses out there that you can purchase .some of the differences of these harnesses are going to be the padding , the styles and how they fit .most climbing harnesses that you would purchase are going to be padded for your comfort .depending on what type of climbing you 're doing is going to depend on the type of harness that you purchase .different types of harnesses for different types of climbing are important .for each type of climbing , top roping , sport climbing or trad climbing , you 're going to invest in a different type of harness .with sport climbing or top roping , your harness is going to be thinner and less padded .for trad climbing , when you 're doing multiple pitches and hanging all day , you 're going to have thicker padding and more geared loops .my favorite type of harness is a misty mountain harness for comfort when i 'm trad climbing .again my name is scott and this has been harnesses .
and you maintain the people 's relationships that i 've mentioned before you are going to have a successful club .however , one area that is very , very important is to have safe and up-to-date equipment , exercise equipment .and over the years i 've learned that leasing the equipment , i 'm talking about weight machines and cardio equipment .the technology has not changed that much recently , but every three to five years there is new equipment that comes on and obviously competition matters in this business .i 've found that leasing the equipment is much more efficient than purchasing the equipment and waiting until it breaks .when you purchase the equipment you usually wait until it wears out and that 's usually somewhere between seven to ten years , or maybe longer .if it 's longer than that , it is outdated equipment , and then you are not competitive with the other clubs .leasing the equipment is very convenient because every three to four years. [CLS] [SEP]it 's usually when the warranty runs out , you can exchange the equipment for brand new equipment .incorporate the expense into your operating expenses and it is much , much better way of dealing with it than trying to keep repairing the old equipment and buying a new one every ten to fifteen years .it does n't work and again , it does n't save you money in the long run .
so here we go .live , right back here .look what 's going on right now .we 've got our scallops ; that 's mine right there .this one i got ; that 's my name .it 's got meat wrapped all over it .so we just want to take these , keep our heat at a medium .you 've added a little bit of oil in there , you 're not going to have to do that much .one of the things i 've always been taught , cook with a low heat .i 'd rather cook with a low heat , get it nice and perfect .as opposed to a super , super high heat and not managing it .and that 's what we do n't want our scallops to go through today .give these a quick toss .look at that , look at that color .now while our scallops are cooking , keep these together .get those in there .keep them nice and folded , because we do n't want them breaking apart .the only reason why i did these today , this way , is because i wanted to show you as a viewer , that if you do n't have toothpicks , if you do n't have something like that available , just keep them bound together .just like that .just like that .so there 's how it is .we 're going to move on to our next step , and it 's really getting down to the final finale .we 've got the basil , redskin mash .we have the reduced seafood stock that 's going to be our citrus-sage butter reduction .then we also have the bacon and prosciutto wrapped scallops .be back for the next one .
so , this is a bead tray .you can get this at most bead shops .and it has measurements on it ,so you can see how long a necklace is going to be .for mostly custom orders , people want their necklaces a certain length .and it has little pockets in it to put all your different things , like so. [CLS] [SEP], you want to use .that way , your beads do n't get all mixed up .and you have everything you need on one little tray .that way , you can line up all the beads along here , like this , and you can put the different colors , different objects .you can line it up yourself and figure out how you want to make the jewelry , design the necklace .
this is an improv game called freeze tag .i like to use it as a warm up. [CLS] [SEP]but some people use it even as a performance game .i find a lot of times teenagers really like to play this game. [CLS] [SEP]cause it 's a lot of ways to a lot of fast really funny scenes .so how it works is you 're going to start with two people on stage and maybe give them a suggestion for an activity that they can be engaged in together .maybe they are making a bed ok.so they are going to start doing that physical activity. [CLS] [SEP], maybe they 're going to start making the bed , and then at any point the director can yell freeze .so when the director yells freeze they need to stop in whatever position they are in .and then a player from off stage is going to come in. [CLS] [SEP]and they 're going to tag one of them out .so i can tag them out and then assume the exact position they were in .and then they 're going to start a completely new scene inspired by this position justifying why are my hands and my body like this .so i might say something like ,alright we 're going to get ready to luge on three , one , two , three. [CLS] [SEP]and then maybe the director yells freeze again. [CLS] [SEP]so now i 'm like this .someone else can tag in like this. [CLS] [SEP]and then i might start a new scene ,oh look it 's a wax on , wax off ,wax on , very good danielson .now paint the fence .freeze , ok and someone else is going to tag in take that position and start a whole new scene inspired by that position .hey man give me five , what 's up , up high alright , down low , too slow , freeze .ok. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's it. [CLS] [SEP], it 's a rapid succession of scenes that are inspired by the position that the player takes .so the scenes can be unrelated , it 's important , it 's a jump and justify game making sense of the position that the person is in .you can tag in for either person in this scene , you can join the three people , you can tag out two people , there 's lots of variations .you can also play a version where it 's a blind freeze tag , where the person who has to go in has their back turned , and they ca n't see what 's going on. [CLS] [SEP]so the director yells freeze. [CLS] [SEP]and they have to really quickly see what 's happening tag someone out and get an idea .so it 's a fun game. [CLS] [SEP]and it helps people to play physically .a good , a good tip for having a successful version of this game is to make sure people move the position , cause you do n't want to have several scenes inspired by the exact same position .so this is a game called freeze tag , fun to do as warm up , fun to do on stage , fun to do with your eyes closed with lots of people or just a few .and it 's a great kind of fast fun warm up kind of game called freeze tag .
the 3 on the left and the right. [CLS] [SEP], they push it down the tapes and the 3 in the middle , they push it down the middle and then they communicate with each other , they tell them oh , he ’ s here. [CLS] [SEP], he ’ s there. [CLS] [SEP]and then they try to move with like the help of other players of their own team .so they tell them. [CLS] [SEP]oh , he ’ s there , back left ,back right , okay you guys shoot these guys in , then they make moves like that .that ’ s how they communicate and move around the field .
alright , now we 're ready to move on to artifactual communication .and i know these are things that you 've thought about. [CLS] [SEP]but i bet you never really thought about them as being part of non verbal communication .well , what artifactual communication is , they are things .things that we have and that 's the first thing i want to talk about .part of your non verbal communication is space decoration .now when i 'm talking about space decoration , i want you to think in terms of your room .your office .your cubicle .your complete home .how do you decorate that space ?that communicates volumes about you as a person non verbally .is it really , really , really , really , really cluttered ?is it immaculately placed ?what kind of art is on the wall ?what kind of things do you surround yourself with ?space decoration communicates who you are .now do you necessarily need to change this ?absolutely not ! !but you need to recognize that the things around you in your environment will establish to other people who you are .
in this clip we 're going to talk to you about a , the return of serve and just some basics in the return of serve is to help you out .whatever kind of stroke you might have just the importance of moving forward and the timing. [CLS] [SEP]and then what kind of a swing you might want to take as far as a shorter swing or a longer swing .so , gustavo 's over there ready for a return of serve , what he 's going to do. [CLS] [SEP]and what you might notice is you might notice me tossing the ball up. [CLS] [SEP]but then him moving forward as i toss the ball up .this is pretty rare for a lot of players. [CLS] [SEP]actually , you want to feel like you 're moving forward when i toss the ball , toss it going up .a lot of players will actually just stand there and wait for the ball to come to them .you have to feel like you 're going towards. [CLS] [SEP]so you cut off the angles and have that motion meeting the ball .so we 'll just watch his timing of him going forward and just get the idea of that right now .he went forward when i tossed the ball. [CLS] [SEP], you see that ?going forward when i toss the ball , my favorite drill. [CLS] [SEP]right here when i 'm teaching , ah i could n't bust him. [CLS] [SEP]but that 's the idea right there .you want to feel like once you toss the ball up. [CLS] [SEP]and he 's going for it. [CLS] [SEP]you want to feel like you can catch him if they 're not .yeah. [CLS] [SEP]and you notice that he 's taking a pretty small swing , pretty small swing. [CLS] [SEP], he 's not taking a large swing because you do n't have time .the idea what i like to teach is just treating the return of serve like a volley and if you can do that. [CLS] [SEP]then it 's a lot easier for you just to have more time and to be able to cut off the angle .you feel like you 're just kind of going after the ball verses the ball coming to you .so again he 's going forward. [CLS] [SEP], there you go ,very , very nice compact swing right there .look at that he was , because he was going forward. [CLS] [SEP]he was able to get to it right there. [CLS] [SEP], he was wide but he was able to get it. [CLS] [SEP]he was n't going sideways or backwards ,very important your movement .
when there is a dress code race , which is usually evident at rodeos and some nicer barrel races where there 's more money at stake , they normally require you to wear a cowboy hat .lots of different sizes , shapes , colors , that does n't matter but you do have to have a hat .most places do have a hat fine though .if you lose your hat during a run it 's usually a fine that they fine you a certain amount of money. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's a good idea to secure your hat either with a stampede string or two-sided tape , bobby pins , whatever you have to do to keep it on your head .the other races do n't require a hat. [CLS] [SEP]and so the rest of this dress code. [CLS] [SEP]i ?m going to talk about is , is what most of the rest of them require .first of all , a long sleeve shirt .if you 're going to a jackpot or a gymkhana , that wo n't be required , but any other barrel race normally will require a long sleeve shirt with a collar .if you buy a shirt from a western store , you 're probably going to be good .they just do n't want to see t-shirts and things like that .the other thing that you 're required to wear is a belt .most barrel racers have won a belt buckle of some kind. [CLS] [SEP]and so you 're going to have a belt buckle with a regular belt , a belt buckle 's not necessary .one thing you do want to watch with your belt buckle though is make sure that your belt is tight enough and close enough to your body that you do n't get your belt buckle caught on your saddle horn when you 're running .that 's a hazard that some people face .then you have to have long jeans .you 're not allowed to wear shorts - anything like that .the jeans are to protect your legs with the saddle .when you ride in shorts , the fenders of your saddle will have a tendency to rub on the inside of your knees and cause you to kind of have a little raspberries there .so you 're going to avoid that by wearing long pants and then the last thing is your boots .these are , are my working boots. [CLS] [SEP]so they 're kind of scary looking ; you can tell i use them a lot .but what you 'll notice about these boots is that they have a heel on them right here .what that does is the stirrup is right here and the heel catches your foot so that your foot ca n't go clear through the stirrup .it 's a safety feature that riding boots have that you need to make sure you have on when you 're running .most places will require that you wear a boot with a heel .if you 're going to wear any other kind of shoes , tennis shoes , things like that are not eligible for a dress code. [CLS] [SEP]so that 's basically what you 're going to wear to a barrel race or a rodeo .
another part of your fly fishing equipment that a lot of people do n't think about is the backing .the backing is what goes on before you put the fly line on , so here 's the back end of my fly line and here 's the backing .that 's usually buried down inside your reel somewhere .the backing serves several purposes .one is your fly line is going to be somewhere between eighty and a hundred feet long .if you happen to hook a fish that pulls out those eighty feet of fly line , you usually will have on your reel , a hundred yards or more of backing , so the backing comes into play if you hook a big fish .now , the other thing the backing does is it increases the diameter of the arbor of the reel .since most of our fly reels are single action , that means you turn the handle around once , the spool goes around once .the backing increases the diameter of the arbor in the center .so , that allows you to pick up the line just a little bit quicker by having a larger diameter center on that reel .the other thing it does is , by increasing the diameter of the center of the reel , the arbor of the reel , it allows your fly line to be wrapped around something that 's a little larger diameter .the fly line , because it has that plastic coating , has what we call memory , so it tends to want to stay coiled , so if you wrap it around the center of the reel , which is a pretty small diameter without the backing , then your line will come off looking like an old fashioned telephone cord with lots of kinks and curls in it , so the backing adds some distance if you hook a big fish , but it also increases that diameter so that you pick up your line a little bit faster and it also keeps your fly line from being wrapped tightly around the center of the reel .
hey it 's tony naile. [CLS] [SEP]i want to talk today how to care for your wooden bat .this is a great common sense answer to this .just keep your bat clean .if you use fine tar or any kind of gripping substance on your bat , try to clean it after each and every day .use a substance with rubbing alcohol , cleans it better than most things .keep it dry .keep it bagged .when you 're storing your bat over the winter use keep it stored in the same temperature as much as you can year around .if your using your bat in batting practice , we like to use ankle tape on the hitting surface of the bat .keep from breaking your bat .also if you 're going to , the best to have the same model bat ,the same weight bat exactly as you can , and use your game bat for games and your other bat for batting practice .you need six or seven bats , have your dad buy you some .just care for your bat keeping it clean , keeping your hand grips on there keeping it stored in good temperature is the best thing i can tell you. [CLS] [SEP]is just and do n't loan it out to people that might break it .these bats are very expensive , very important to you .this is how you make your living .thank you .
perhaps your dealing with a customer. [CLS] [SEP]i do n't know if this ever happened to you and two co-workers are standing off to the side talking about something .probably just inappropriate if this customer over hears. [CLS] [SEP]it no matter how professional your working towards being with that customer , what ever is taking place over here. [CLS] [SEP]it 's over heard can definitely have bearing on your dealing with that customer .i mentioned before also that i worked in a call center if we have one person on the phone. [CLS] [SEP]but maybe the agent next to that person is involved in a personal conversation with somebody else .perhaps there 's use of foul language just maybe the conversation is to loud , maybe they 're arguing with somebody .remember those customers can hear what 's going on around them to and when they hear that type of conversation or that type of language being used , even if it 's not directed and them .even if it 's not by the customer service provider that they are dealing with that will definitely have a very negative impact on your customer perspective of the professionalism of your business .so again be very careful about the indirect communication that you have with your customer .
now there 's a couple more points i want to bring up when talking about what type of container to choose , size and drainage .now , some people make the mistake of choosing a container that is too big for their plant .i say , do n't choose a container that is more than four or five inches wider than the container it 's in .if you have your plant in a six inch pot , put it into an eight or ten inch container .do n't think , oh the plant 's going to grow into this container , because the fact is , most plants do n't grow that fast ,so you can re-pot. [CLS] [SEP]your plant in the next size up , and then re-pot it again next year .maybe once every like one to two years you 'll have to re-pot it .now the exception would be a vegetable seedling .vegetable seedlings grow really fast , or annual flowers like pansies , or different types of annual flowers that you buy in the six packs .those grow really fast , so you could put a very small one of those plants into a much larger container .another thing to think about when choosing your container is whether or not to have a drainage hole .i think it 's actually a good thing not to have a drainage hole if you 're going to put your plant on some expensive furniture , say like a really fancy wooden table , or if you 're going to put it on like a nice hardwood floor , or let 's say that you have your plant outside in the hot sun .if you have no drainage in the bottom , that 's almost like a good thing if you live in a really hot climate , like a desert region , because then you do n't have the water as much .also , with no drainage hole you could also grow water plants , and that 's kind of fun too ; if you make kind of like a miniature pond .so think about these things when choosing your container .think about what size container to choose , what shape of container to choose , and also , whether or not to have a drainage hole .
alright , now we 're going to learn how to do two in one hand , which is eventually going to be your first three ball trick .so two in one hand. [CLS] [SEP]a lot of people find difficult because they try to throw the balls so that they rotate in a pattern towards them .so they end up trying to do this , which is very difficult to do .the way you should do it , the easiest way to do it , is to make the balls travel in a pattern that is a circle from the inside of your body to the outside depending on what hand you 're using .if i 'm using my left hand , the balls should go in this pattern .right hand , this pattern .so , the first trick in learning to just to in one hand , is the same as when you 're doing the three ball learning pattern , except instead of throwing to the other hand you are throwing straight up and a little to the outside , and once again as it 's coming down , before you catch it , you throw the other on up .start with one catch and catch it. [CLS] [SEP]and as you get farther , try to increase your number of catches .but you have to be very careful to not just work on your dominant hand or that 's that only way you 'll be able to do it .so you have to always pay attention to your other hand as well .when i started , a good way to do , learn new tricks , was i would n't count numbers , because i do n't know , for me that 's too stressful .when you start to get to the number that you know you need to break , you inevitably drop .so what i always did , was do the alphabet .sounds stupid but it worked for me .so i would do a , b , c , ok ,well now the next time , that 's my record , i want to get farther than c , and for some reason your mind is tricked , for me at least , that i ca n't see them coming as well because i 'm not as fluent with letters as numbers .it 's so easy for everybody to count .so that 's what worked for me .you can try whatever you want , but the object eventually is to be able to do two balls into and out of the three ball pattern .it 's a very simple trick once you can do two balls .start two in one hand and throw one over , then go right into the three ball that we already learned earlier .
so like i said , we 've got all our nice round wads here and. [CLS] [SEP]we know which sides are which because we put them up with the spiral side up .so when we are ready to throw them on the wheel head , we know where we are going with that .so we are going to do some basic centering here .this is the most basic part of ceramics but the most important part of throwing because you want to have your stuff centered .you can throw off center once you learn how to throw centered. [CLS] [SEP]but you ca n't just start working off center .you can go back and make some fun pots off center. [CLS] [SEP]but you have to get the basic centering done first .and this takes quite a while and a lot of practice and you will go through hundreds and hundreds of these balls before you perfect this basic technique that is just so simple but also so hard to master .so what you want to do is maybe give your wheel a nice spin .you can find the center of the wheel and know where it is .so once you find that center , take your clay , make sure the spiral side is up , the nice flat side is down and find that center and get right up on it like that and pretty much hit it .squash it there. [CLS] [SEP]and there we are .it is not centered but it is getting there .what you want to do is stick it to the wheel head .get your finger a little wet and press down on the side there. [CLS] [SEP]and you are just going to stick it to the wheel head .
in this clip i am going to show you a contour on the cheek using the powder .first you want to apply the foundation and then set it with translucent powder .then i 'm going to go in with my contour color which is about a shade darker than her natural skin. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to start right at the ear .i 'm going to do circular motions right underneath the cheek bone and just blend it in and then go back in and build it up to the level of darkness that you want but start small and build it up because it 's harder to remove than it is to add .then i want to go in with my highlight color which is a couple shades lighter than her natural skin and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to go right along the top of her cheek bone. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's really going to shape her cheek bones .that 's how you contour a cheek using a powder .
the second tool that you 'll need to bird watch is a field guide .there are many field guides out .field guides for each state , field guides for half of the country , the eastern peterson 's , the eastern fibley 's , coffman 's field guide is for the entire country .if you 're going to be traveling , maybe one for the entire country would be best .if you 're going to spend most of your time looking at birds in your home area , then a field guide for eastern united states , or western united states , if you live there , would be best , possibly .rogar tory peterson , one of the world 's most prominent birders who past away a few years ago , developed a system of field marks in the field guide , where there are actually little arrows pointing to the specific part of the bird , that helps you identify exactly what that bird is .for me , birding is a process of elimination .i see a bird , is it a grackle ?no !is it a dove ?no !i eliminate what it 's not , until i 'm sure of what it is. [CLS] [SEP]and i do that by looking at the field guides and reading the information on the different bird families and the information of that specific species of bird .
we 're going to continue the cross front , but this time adding a little body pulse on each side .so you want to bring the elbows in , and let your belly too , just a little bit , so you have a little action of the pelvis from front to back .so as we cross front , rocking the tail bone , drawing the elbows in , letting your body pulse , relaxed ,easy pulse , hips from the front to the back. [CLS] [SEP], just let it gently rock , using the elbows to support the pulse , sensing the tail bone , palms are up , drawing in .feet are stable , 12 to 6 o'clock ; cross front with a pulse .
what we are going to do is we are going to go on to some cardio and. [CLS] [SEP]what we are specifically going to do is we are going to do some hopping. [CLS] [SEP]so now that he is pretty much warmed up he might be waiting for his wrestling match or for his time to get on the field. [CLS] [SEP]so he is just going to hop. [CLS] [SEP], he 's just going to hop .this is a great way and it is similar to jump roping. [CLS] [SEP]but if you do n't have a jump rope or you do n't have the area to jump rope , might be a low area or people standing around you , you can just do this in a crowd of people , you can do this while you are waiting on the sidelines , you can do this in a variety of ways .you can twist the torso as well. [CLS] [SEP]and it just keeps you loose .it keeps everything loose , it keeps the calves warm. [CLS] [SEP]it keeps everything going , helps you break the sweat. [CLS] [SEP]and it helps you to stay warm. [CLS] [SEP]so you can keep yourself hydrated and to kind of give yourself a game feeling even when you are not in the game. [CLS] [SEP]so the simulation is not going to be quite the same as the actual fallout intensity of competition. [CLS] [SEP]but this is something that will at least not allow you to walk into the field of competition and be completely ice cold .he is just going to hop. [CLS] [SEP]and he is going to take his time .it is an easy thing to do and you just stick with it until the coach calls your name and then you are ready to rock .
i must forsooth be forced to give my hand opposed against my heart , unto a mad brain rudesby .mad brain rudesby ?i 'm going to have to look that one up .good old shakespeare .you know shakespeare said all the world is a stage .i 'm janice creneti , director of the girlstories theater project in tampa , florida .and i 'm here to talk to you today about how to become an actress .i 've been acting for over twenty-five years myself , so i 've learned a few things along the way .well part of it depends on exactly what kind of actress you want to be .there 's film , there 's live theater and you can do straight plays , you can do musicals .there 's voice over work , and even now , acting on the internet .but no matter what kind of acting. [CLS] [SEP]you do. [CLS] [SEP]there 's some basic skills that every actor needs to be as prepared as possible .first thing that you need to think about is knowing your instrument , and for actors , the instrument is your voice , and your body .two very important components to acting well , no matter what form you 're doing .so with your voice there 's things that you need to think about like projecting .you have to be loud enough to be heard , especially if you 're in a live setting .articulation , you 've got to speak slowly and clearly .you want people to understand what you 're saying , you 're responsible for helping them follow the action of the story .once you 're comfortable with those basics then you can start to think about things like accents , having accents prepared can really help when you 're trying to audition for specific roles where an english accent might be required for instance , or a southern accent .once you 've got the voice part down , it 's also time to think about body movement .you see , movement is a very important way of showing your character onstage .i always think about that when i 'm developing my character , how does my character stand , how does my character sit , how does my character walk , if they 're happy or if they 're sad .it does a great job of conveying how you 're really feeling .movement classes can be really helpful for an actor because they focus specifically on how you use movement to perform onstage .now if you 're thinking about musical theater , then you also want to add singing lessons and also dance lessons .a lot of musicals will expect you to be able to sing , dance and act .that 's what they call a triple threat .so classes of any of those things can be very helpful .once you know the basics of how to actually be an actor , you have to find a place to act .look into joining a local acting network , find out what 's in your area , it could be children 's theater , it could be dinner theater , it could be community theater .or if you 're in school , you can get involved at the school level .no matter what , acting is a great time , but you want to be prepared when you go to that audition .so i 'm janice creneti and this is how to prepare to become an actress .
now i 'm going to talk to you about cleaning your lens if you own a drill mount or a rimless pair of glasses .again you 're using the microfiber cloth , but in this instance you have to be a little bit more careful because you do n't want to put any extra pressure on the point at which the lens is screwed in .so what i like to do is pretty much hold the cloth over , put a little bit of pressure on that fulcrum so that you 're not pulling on it. [CLS] [SEP], you 're actually pushing on the fulcrum so that it 's not coming loose when you move around the lens .from there , i just kind of move across the lens .again , you do n't want to put pressure on any of these two points here or here , so hold onto one of them as you clean near the edges .the other thing is getting around the point at which it 's drilled .that can actually be kind of problematic .there 's actually points as to. [CLS] [SEP]where they ...these are push pin inserts right here , so you have to clean around them .generally speaking , i would take my fingernail , of course with the cloth , and kind of run under it and over it to get any of that grime or dust , or whatever it may be , a smudge , from off of there .but again , make sure you hold it at a point where you 're not putting so much stress on the frame itself or where the frame is attached to the lens .that 's key when discussing how to take care of your drill mount frames , because the last thing you want to do is snap them off when you 're just cleaning them .

okay we are going into unlocking our channel lock. [CLS] [SEP]so each individual device can change. [CLS] [SEP]it 's own channels .right now it is on the global lock. [CLS] [SEP]so only the cable box can work right now .so let 's go in and change that .now what we are going to do is to we are going to unlock the global channel lock. [CLS] [SEP]so each individual device can work and you can change the channels being the television , dvd player or vcr .so what we are going to do is we are going to press cable , we are going to hold the setup button. [CLS] [SEP]and you see it blink twice .now the next thing we are going to press. [CLS] [SEP]you see here we are going to press 973 and after you press 973 we are going to hit the channel down once .now that we hit the channel down once now we should be looking into being able to control our devices .
hi , i 'm harvery woodyatt .i 'm owner of perfect tan here in orem , utah .we 're a fool service tanning salon .we have over twenty tanning beds as well as a spray on system .i often get asked , `` how do i avoid the bikini line tan ? ''and the best way to help you with that is if you 're tanning in doors ,most people tan in the nude .it 's a very secure environment .your rooms are locked .but , remember when tanning in the nude , you are going to be tanning parts of your body that have probably never seen the sun before .so , you have to be very careful on your exposure there .make sure you use a good indoor tanning lotion .be careful of your time .even if you feel you 're tan and your arms and your upper body. [CLS] [SEP]and you 've been tanning in a swimming suit .but , if you tan in the nude , those parts of your body could get burned .so , you want to reduce your time until that part of your body develops into a nice even tan .outside , i guess you 're going to have a bikini line just because you 're outdoors .but , indoors feel free to tan in the nude .most people do .if you 're worried you can cover up with a towel .towels are provided in most tanning rooms .always ask for an extra towel if you need one .but , be careful again .you do n't want to overexpose those areas that never seen the sun before because those areas will be more tender and definitely will burn .
alright .so , this our downbeat high hat lift on three .i 'm on 80 bpm .go ahead , take a listen .take a look at what 's happening with my feet and how they 're kind of working in relationship to each other and also with hands .here we go .alright , make sense .let 's go ahead and do it together .i 'll count us off .this is high hat lift on the downbeat of beat three , one , two , ready ,play .alright , make sense .mechanically , this is the same as when we did beat one .musically , it gives a very sound .practice it on your own .slow it down if you need to , and here ' the next clip .
so we 're working on the second rift from weaser 's. [CLS] [SEP]`` say it ai n't so '' , and we 're working on the third lick of that rift , so here is the rift and entirety .( playing guitar )the first two licks are like this. [CLS] [SEP], here 's lick one ( playing )lick two , lick three. [CLS] [SEP]so he comes out of. [CLS] [SEP]this bend by bending back to normal and coming down a half step .( playing )so once again the entire rift ( playing ) .
so now we get a little funky on the bass here. [CLS] [SEP]so we got our major scale .what we are going to do is play through that scale and utilize different notes or different patterns in this scale and put different rhythms behind it to make it kind of funky .( playing guitar )so it is really the space you put in between the notes. [CLS] [SEP]notice how i 'm not just walking , i put in space .( playing guitar )so the key behind the funk is just really staying in that scale pattern but utilizing the space units and the different intervals you can get within that pattern .( playing )that is your g major funk .
and i 'm going to go ahead and turn my machine on 2 minutes .from here , i 'm actually going to take my other hand and apply it directly to my client 's skin .the reason is because we need to create a complete surface , because i am conducting , i will need to also have a current going through her skin .when applying this on your own , you do n't need to have a separate hand on any other part of your body .you can just apply directly to the skin .the first thing we 're going to do is just kind of work into the skin in circular motions .this is really doing amazing things with the skin .it 's bringing oxygen to the skin .these gels actually have a negative pull to them .because we are using negative current , we 're actually pushing that product very deep within the skin to bind impurities .the areas we 'll really want to concentrate on are any areas of congestion .typically , most clients will have it around the nose , the chin , around the t-zone areas .you 'll notice also that the machine is beeping .that is telling me that the current is working. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's actively conducting with the skin .we 're just going to go ahead and keep doing this .i notice my client is getting just a little dry , so i 'm going to take a little toner and spritz it directly on her skin because we need to make sure we have moistness on the skin to actively conduct .in this setting , we really do n't need to have a specific movement pattern on the skin .again , just concentrate on those specific areas .circular motions are just fine .however , when doing the positive polarity , we 'll want to go a little bit more with the facial muscles .when this side is all finished , your machine will beep twice .that will tell you that the time is up. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's ready to move on .watch our next segment on removing excess pre-treatment gel .
make sure that you have your pan properly positioned to catch any additional oil which may drain out .so , we 're going to check , we do have the same type , the 7317 type oil filter .then we 're going to set the old oil filter aside. [CLS] [SEP]and i like to lubricate the o-ring and make sure that everything looks good. [CLS] [SEP]; there 's no metal filings in it .then we will carefully without getting any dirt into the new oil filter .well you know what ?first i 'm going to clean off the parting face here of any dirt .so that 's where the o-ring will touch the metal. [CLS] [SEP]and so we want to clean that off pretty good .now we will position the new oil filter onto the crank case and turn it clockwise to thread it on .okay , now it 's spinning on freely .so we 're going to continue screwing this on until we fill the o-ring contact. [CLS] [SEP]the crank case. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to continue tightening this to approximately 40 pounds , 40 foot pounds of tork .
next thing i 'll show you the snake arms .for snake arms it 's very important to keep yourself in correct posture , tail bone tucked under ,knees slightly bent and chest lifted .we 're going to start with your left arm , elbow up first through the wrist , through the knuckles and through the fingertips and to release that , elbow , wrist and fingers .elbow up , wrist , fingers , elbow down , wrist , fingers .and again , the points to hit are elbow up , wrist up , knuckles , and through the fingertips .elbow , wrist , and down to the fingers .to smooth that out , this is what it would look like .again , keeping your posture , elbow , wrist , fingers , elbow , wrist , fingers .now the other arm .you want to bring the elbow up , wrist , knuckles , fingers , elbow , wrist , fingers .elbow , wrist , fingers , elbow , wrist , fingers .and smoothing it out , and to put it together , what you want to do , starting with your left arm , elbow , wrist fingers , and as that turns to come down , the other elbow , wrist , fingers .again , as that turns to come down , elbow , wrist , fingers , and as that comes down , the other one 's coming up .and here is a smooth snake arm .
now it 's time to feed the beast .it 's time to load your paintball gun .now you open the top up .you 've got your hopper firmly attached to the weapon .and make sure .it has a little indent on the inside of it .so you can tell when it 's firmly in there .when you 're loading your weapon calmly by the gun hut , off the field , it 's a pretty straight forward thing .there you go .you have paint .now when you 're loading under fire it can be a little bit different .one thing you ought to remember is if you can have a team mate cover you while you reload , that is best .i 've been shot several times while trying to reload my paint. [CLS] [SEP]so i say that from personal experience .the other thing to remember again is that when you 're loading paint on the field , even if it 's just a couple of balls , the ones that hit the ground , they 're not worth picking up and putting back into your weapon .because when those rounds get inside the cyclone feed if they 've got any debris on them you 're probably done and you 're probably headed back up to clean your weapon .
when most people think of ceramic , they think of the ashtray they made their mom in 3rd grade .it 's not that .it 's actually a metal oxide .if you take a aluminum and you super heat it and add oxygen , that 's basically what you 're going to get .it makes it conduct electricity super great .it also puts out a lot of negative ions , which again , helps that water to evaporate , cut down on frizz , and help the hair dry faster .ceramic is something that you 're definitely going to want to get whenever looking into any of these products .curling irons have it .flat irons have it .they all have the ceramic coating , so it 's not something that 's going to break like a bowl or something .it 's a coating. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's actually metal .what happens if the ceramic starts to chip off ?if it starts to chip off , you 're really going to want to get rid of the tool and get a new one .ceramic is the newest thing. [CLS] [SEP]and i highly recommend if you have a tool that 's old. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's the traditional metal tool , get rid of it .go out and get yourself a new ceramic iron , flat iron , or blow dryer .
now again just like the hip abduction machine you want to make sure that you become familiar with it before you get started , so here 's where we 'll be sitting , here are handles , here are the pads that we 're going to be resting our legs against , the stirrups for our feet 's and then on this side we have the handle that we pulling in ,okay just pull it up and out. [CLS] [SEP]and then you can just adjust .
now , i 'm going to show you how to improvise with these notes .remember when you improvise , let 's try to think about the notes .let 's try to hear it in our heads before we play it next , okay .we 're going to use all the accidentals we can in an a minor melodic scale .so , let 's play the scale first to get it in your ear .that 's an a minor melodic scale .let 's improvise now .
so now we are going to move on to a different technique .this is a technique where you use glitter to make a glitter design without the use of the gilded paste .here is the glue that i 'm going to use. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to make a flower .just trace the glue into the shape of a flower .this glues is like a similar to eyelash adhesive that you use .it can also be used to put on the jewels later on .basically i 'm going to make the shape of the flower and make the petals .then i 'm going to squeeze the glitter on it. [CLS] [SEP]and it does not matter if you go a little bit over the edge because we are going to use a brush to brush off the excess .there you have the design .these are very clear outline .this almost dries immediately. [CLS] [SEP]so you do n't have to worry about using the hair dryer .it can be removed later with a little dab of alcohol with a cotton ball or something and it would come right off .
hi , i am theresa. [CLS] [SEP]and i am here with reyna. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going on to the next step of a perfect manicure , which is orange wood stick .this does have a lot of uses but the first one we are going to use it for is for cuticles .being that we have cuticle remover on her cuticles and her cuticles are n't even that bad we can go ahead and use the orange wood stick .again i like to just get everything wet .and you want to gently push these back .not trying really push them back .they should be nice and soft by now since you 've soaked them in the water and have put the cuticle remover on there .get the orange wood stick and start from the corner .and do n't go up and down. [CLS] [SEP], just gently push them back .push , push , push , go to this side all the way up and push , push , push .go to the next one and push , down and push down .reyna keeps her nails nice and manicured .and that 's great because in between you wo n't have so many , so much cuticles to push back and take off .if reyna did get manicures occasionally often and they were really bad cuticles , you would have to go onto the metal pusher .and this one like i said is a lot stronger than the orange wood stick .it could really push those cuticles back if they 're , you have somebody that has n't had a manicure a long time .and they simply come off .they simply just come off ; just push down and go around .and this is the best tool to have i think .being that you have the orange wood stick , wet it .get a little bit of cotton .this is your time to clean up underneath the nails .get a little bit of water and just gently go underneath the nail .and get all that dirt that the water loosened up for you and take it off .
ok , the next step in our bedroom painting project is to actually roll out the ceiling paint .the tools i 'll be using include a roller of course , my roller sleeve. [CLS] [SEP]and i 've also got an extension pole which you 're going to need if you 're painting a ceiling .i 'm going to take my ceiling white , pour it into the bucket like three or four inches .you also want to make sure that the floor is adequately covered because we do n't want to get any paint dripped on the floor .you 're going to dip your roller several times to make sure it gets saturated with paint .to avoid any drips , you really want to make sure its worked in there good .k.then i 'm going to attach my extension pole .and this is just to various heights , i 'm going to keep it pretty low though .and you want to start on one end and just work your way over gradually .you want to apply a fair amount of pressure but not too much and again , keep in mind that this is the first of two coats .so if you miss a spot the first time around , you 'll catch it the second time .painting a ceiling can be a little tricky in that the color we 're using is the same as the previous color. [CLS] [SEP]so its kind of hard to delineate where we 've been. [CLS] [SEP]so that makes it all the more important to keep a consistent sort of rhythm down .go from one edge to the next .ok , that does it for our first coat of ceiling paint .we 're going to let that dry for a couple hours. [CLS] [SEP]and i definitely recommend putting a second coat on .now let 's move on to some trim work .
on the river livit runs between 2 mountains in scotland and therefore , it 's produced in a glen. [CLS] [SEP]a glen being the river that runs through 2 mountain ranges .
as you can see i 'm. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm here with two wheelchairs .this is not like my spare basketball chair .this is my everyday chair that i live in , and you know , just go to school and work , and pull it in my van .and the wheels do n't slant out .the reason the wheels slant out on this basketball chair ; there 's two main reasons .number one , it helps you turn a lot quicker , because we get going fifteen ; twenty miles an hour , and if you go to turn , in a chair like this you 'd just flip over sideways .but with these wheels it 's called camber .we have them about , you know , eighteen , twenty degrees camber .it helps you turn quicker , so we can be going down the floor , and dribbling , and and maneuvering , and getting it around people .so that 's a primary reason of , for the camber .a secondary reason is it protects your fingers .if if we had two basketball chairs next to each other , you can see how the bottom of the wheels hit before the fingers get close to getting smashed , so it 's really not a big problem in wheelchair basketball to get your fingers smashed .but you notice i sit lower in this chair than that chair , and that 's because it gives me more balance .i 'm a pretty high injury .i do n't have stomach muscles ; i do n't have hip muscles , so i need to sit a little bit lower to get that that stability .you might also notice i 've got some straps .when i jump in my basketball chair here to play tennis , or basketball , or whatever ,i 'm strapping , you know ,i 'm putting all these all these like straps along my lap , and i even bring some around my belly .some people do n't have an injury that 's quite as severe as mine , and they 've got plenty of balance in their legs and hips , but i need this strapping .it helps stabilize me in my wheelchair .and then if we go to the back of this basketball wheelchair , you 'll see what we call a fifth wheel , and this fifth wheel back here has come along in the last seven , eight , ten years , and it 's very important , because now guys can be very aggressive ; leaning backwards , or or going for rebounds , or somebody might smack in behind you , and you do n't have a tendency to want to flip over backwards , because we 've got that fifth wheel down there on the ground .but but we have we have air in the tires ; there are different size of wheels .they have rules in wheelchair basketball that you ca n't sit. [CLS] [SEP]more than twenty-one inches high ; you ca n't have more than a certain size of cushion .so they have things that are rules that we just know about , that i do n't want to , you know , walk you through in too much detail , but there are rules about the equipment and the chairs , and you know , it 's just all part of the game .they before the game starts they line us up at half court , and the referees check our chairs , and make sure we 've got pads on the back. [CLS] [SEP]so we 're not smashing people 's knees , and just all the things you do .
also panasonic has an exclusive agreement with leica and leica makes great lenses too .which are better ?well it 's real hard to say , they are all fairly equivalent and it depends on who you talk to as far as professional photographers which lenses they like .another thing that 's important is flash , how far will the flash go and the lower end of the lens and. [CLS] [SEP]how much the lower end of the lens means what equivalent does it have on a film camera like a twenty-eight millimeter lens is very good for scenes .they also have thirty-five millimeter , thirty-five millimeter sometimes is n't enough to get scenes completely in. [CLS] [SEP]but at thirty five millimeter there is very little distortion as far as a curvature .whereas a twenty-eight millimeter there is starts to become some curvature in your photograph and some distortion in that direction if you 're too close to something .
okay .so i 've got all these clippings for my new strings and the bulk of my old strings to deal with .and again , as i 've said , the only real safety concern with changing guitar strings is these sharp ends that strings can have on them , and you do n't want these in a plastic trash bag , loose , where they can poke through and scratch somebody or even impale somebody .so you 're just going to go ahead and wrap them carefully in a loose coil like this , and your goal is to kinda tuck all those sharp ends , you know , towards the inside .and then you can get one of these paper , little bags that the strings can pack in and even if you want to be extra careful , pack it back inside the vinyl or cardboard packaging. [CLS] [SEP]it came in .in that way , you can throw it away with a clean conscience that you 're not going to give somebody tetanus with your newly changed guitar strings .
okay. [CLS] [SEP]so , you 're going to need a toolbox or some sort of box to carry all your supplies and beads in .this is what i use , a toolbox .you can get bead boxes at the bead store , but you can also get toolboxes at hardware stores , sporting goods stores , places like that .and then you also have different types of containers .these have unscrewable little containers , like this .and little jars with lids , anything with a lid that closes .use pill bottles .these just come off like that , really simple .and some of the stuff you buy at the bead shop comes in containers already .so you can reuse these .and i use lots of little ziploc bags , like this .and these are little , tiny containers , also .some beads already come in these , but you may have something else stored in them , and it 's all empty now .these come in bottles like this , with a little lid .and these are things that you can use for storage .
the mechanics of the back cast and the forward cast are exactly the same .they are just going in opposite directions .it has been called by many things trying to describe it .mel kreigel calls it the whump , whump move .lefty cray says speed up and stop , which is excellent .mccaulie lord who teaches at l.l . [CLS] [SEP]bean has another great description .he calls it pop stop and all these descriptions are trying to describe the fact that the mechanics work like this .you ’ re moving the rod through a straight line , accelerating on that straight line path gradually and smoothly—to an abrupt stop position .so it ’ s gradual start , accelerate , stop .
onions are one that you can sometimes get in small bulbs that you can plant out , and that makes it pretty easy .but if you want the most economical way to raise onions , you want to go ahead , and buy a package of seeds .now there again , with seeds are tiny .these seeds are little tiny black specks of seeds that are onion seeds , and you want to plant them about one time as deep as they are thick .so we 're talking what , maybe a sixteenth or a eighteenth of an inch in size .it is n't going to be very much .now you can just kind of sprinkle them into the area , like we 're doing here .you can make a row if you want , but i like to just kind of put em ' into the earth box all over , and if you do that ; you can kinda ' go ahead , and sprinkle them out. [CLS] [SEP], you 're gon na ' have fine results .take your hand ; kinda ' rake in the seeds , cover em ' over lightly if you will , and make sure they stay moist .now we talked about radishes earlier .radishes are ready in about twenty-five days .onions are gon na ' take about a hundred days , so they 're a long time crop .do n't forget that they 're there , and do n't be impatient .you can harvest the small ones as green onions , but i like to get let em ' get up in bulb .for on gardening , i 'm stan de freitas , mr. [CLS] [SEP]green thumb .
we finished our sound mix and we open up original edit project in this case it was cut in final cut pro .i want to import the audio and get it back into the session. [CLS] [SEP]so i can output it in final video tape .so , i will go over to file and import. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to look for a file , not a folder .i put it on my desktop in this case so i can find it nice and easy .there is my mixed soda movie. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to go ahead and import that .it 's going to appear back right over here .here is my final mix .now , why is it going to be in sync ?a little trick that i did is bought in my quicktime movie. [CLS] [SEP]and i put it right at the head of the session .i made my file starting at the start of the session .so there for it 's going to have the same exact start point , so i do n't have to worry about that .that 's a good trick .make your start point the same start point as your quicktime movie or project in you will be in sync every time .let 's bring it down and drop it into a track .now , i have my final mix brought in .i can go ahead mute those other tracks if i want .i can play the final mix .so you can hear the combination of tracks .that 's the way to do it like that .ok , now have our final mixed audio in a track along with our high quality video. [CLS] [SEP]and we have the ability now to output the best quality we can .we have our regional video and our mixed audio. [CLS] [SEP]and we can output the tape .so that 's the best way to do it .
we can use a number of tools to cut our plants ( demonstrates ) we can use scissors ( regular kitchen scissors . [CLS] [SEP])these are used for sewing , you can get them at any sewing store or you can use a knife or you can use big pruners , but for most house plants you 're not going to use something that is too big , and i suggest you use the snips or the scissors .so , we have to keep our tools clean because every time you make a cut on the plant you open it up for disease .so you can do a few things , you can use just regular household alcohol and we can use a scrub brush from the kitchen if you have one and just clean it off and get it nice and clean. [CLS] [SEP]( demonstrates )so we can do all our tools .these got a little tougher stuff on it , you can also take just some water and add some bleach , another disinfectant like about 10 %and i can soak these tools for about 5 or 10 minutes and they will be nice and clean for when i want to use them and just when i am done. [CLS] [SEP], just dry it off because the plants , they do n't like disinfectant , they do n't like bleach , so they should be clean and sanitary for us to use .
we 're back .we 're going to be talking about your child 's food allergy and the symptoms that could possibly happen .things that you want to look for .some common things that you would n't even think would be a problem and that you may not even be allergic to , for some reason your child has built up an allergy to this .and it could have some serious , serious symptoms .something could even be the child could stop breathing , they may have breathing difficulty , go into anaphylactic shock , and those are just some of the major ones .and those can happen do to something like peanuts .peanuts are known to and lots , quite a few people are actually allergic to peanuts , to the point where they ca n't even be other nuts ca n't even be in the vicinity of the peanut and they will have a reaction to it .severity could be shock , could be breathing difficulty , your throat starts closing up .this happens a lot with shellfish , also .and the other things are mucus forming foods like wheat and milk .these are both very mucus forming foods .so they can actually , your child can develop a lot of mucus problems where they 're either coughing or they 're doing a lot of throat clearing , that ( throat clearing sound ) feeling , that kind of feeling .these can cause that a lot with your child , especially skin diseases like eczema ,acne , those types of things can be attributed to wheat and milk especially .these are obviously more food sensitivities and basically not true allergies but they are symptoms and just the mere taking these foods away can alleviate many of these more minor type symptoms and that can really help your child out .
and now we 're going to discuss `` dusk imp '' .dusk imp is another powerful card out of the black color .this is in the basic black , 10th edition .as we see here , is a creature `` imp , '' which means he gets benefits for all things that benefit imps , and it 's 2 and a black to play , so you 're playing dusk imp for 2 and a black , which has a converted mana of cost of 3.you 're going to get a 2/1 for this cost , which is almost even mana production ; however , as you see here , creature is going to have an ability , his ability is flying .and once again , flying is a very powerful ability because this creature can only be blocked by creatures with flying and or creatures with reach , which means that you now have a 2/1 instead of a 1/1 flyer , which means this card can do twice as much damage as those other cards , and it has flying , which a lot of decks are not built to defend against flying creatures .this is a very powerful card .
( playing guitar ) please see the next video in this series for the next segment of impetu .
i 've been keeping reptiles and amphibians for over forty years .i 'm here to talk to you about southern cricket frogs .this is a very small frog , about that big , that occurs in the southern united states , and they actually look kind of like toads , because their skin is bumpy or granular .and they can come in a variety of patterns .some of them have stripes on them that can be green , some of them have a reddish stripe .and these are very small frogs that occur in , usually permanent bodies of water .your area creeks , lakes or swamps .they get their name cricket frog because of their call .it sounds like a cricket .they can be rather noisy .fishermen like to use cricket frogs for bait .i once saw somebody pick up a little cricket frog and throw him out in the pond , they said this was a bass test .and the water erupted , and that frog was eaten pretty quickly by a big bass .so obviously , they like to eat 'em .but they 're very quick frogs , live in the water 's edge , hop around in the mud close to the water where it 's wet , and in the springtime they can be rather noisy if you 're in an area where they 're calling .
this is the most essential part .this is going to be your basis for your spin later on , and this is a really crucial part .so , here 's how you do it .when you come up , you 're going to have the correct speed. [CLS] [SEP]like i talked about in the last clip .you 're going to come up .you 're going to spot the coping .you 're going to want to put your back wheel on the coping like this .i know it looks funny. [CLS] [SEP]but this is how you do it .you 're going to keep your back wheel on the coping .if you miss like this , oop , you 're either going to do a 540 tail tap. [CLS] [SEP]or you 're just going to fall .if you get it like this , usually , if you do n't have great brakes , you 're going to go like this. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to toss the bike .while you 're doing this , it 's kind of tricky process because when you go up , you need to look for the coping with your head turned .you 're going to have your head turned to the side , but you 're also going to be spotting your landing for this step .
let 's go over the smile chest movement .this movement will combine both the torso slide and the chest pulled .make sure your feet are parallel to each other , slightly apart , knees are bent , belly button 's pulled in towards the spine , chest is lifted , shoulders are relaxed and down .arms are out to your side .first let 's slide our chest out to one side .now we 're going to bring the chest in toward our body and slide to the other side and release back to a neutral position .now pull , slide out to the side , pull in and slide over and release .slide , pull in , over and release .now let 's try it with some music .five , six , seven , eight .now try that at home in front of the mirror .
so in this video we 're going to start thinking about how we 're putting all the phrases together , combining different scratches. [CLS] [SEP], how to think about just the overall phrases when we 're scratch soloing .so you ready ?let 's go .so you have your set of scratches that you 're doing and how you string them together .i 'll give you a couple of quick examples and then we 'll talk about it for a second .so you saw how each of those phrases had a distinct flow to them .it 's , it 's most important that when you 're stringing together scratches , be able to think it in your head beforehand or even be able to articulate it beforehand .every scratch phrase should have a flow just like a conversation has a regular cadence at the beginning. [CLS] [SEP]and the end of a sentence .
it is very important that you have your primary chain and adjustment .on this particular brand of motorcycle , harley davidson road king , your drain plug is right here under the primary ; takes a torque ’ s 40 , turn it out and just let it drain .you will see that this is a magnetic plug .some times there will be slight shavings on this plug because the chain does off shavings with wear .don ’ t be alarmed if there are some shavings on it .you will want to discard this plug and get you a new plug .now we have the primary fluid draining out .if at this time you smell anything that smells burnt , very burnt , like a burnt nasty , stinky , awful smell , odds are that you are having a problem with your stator .if you don ’ t have any kind of nasty smells but just has an oil smell to it. [CLS] [SEP], you ’ ll be just fine .now what we will do is take off the primary chain inspection cover .now you want to check your chain for tightness .the chain runs right behind here and what you want to have is you want to check out a cold setting which is 5/8th ’ s to 7/8th ’ s of an inch. [CLS] [SEP]basically ¾ ’ s of an inch .you want to set your ruler ; take a small 6 inch rule , put it inside the primary up against the chain , you can use the bottom of the primary as a mark to gage your width , and push gently up on the ruler until it stops .this chain is actually perfect .
stretches through the hips and for the lower body - grab yourself plenty of space .bring your feet out as comfortable as you can feel in your inner thigh muscles .we 're going to take both hands together .we 're just going to reach down the leg and come on down as far as we can .once we 're down here , we like to hold as long as we can and start to focus on your breath .if i 'm going to take a side angle here. [CLS] [SEP], i want you to come down both hands towards your toe .you 're going to take a deep breath in and exhale .each time you 're going to try to feel that your torso wants to lay on top of your leg .hold it for about 3 to 5 to 7 deep breaths , depends on how hot you are and how much you need to cool down .inhale to come up to work over to the other side with the exhale down .again , hold for a number of breaths , the same number of breaths that you did on the previous leg .inhale to come up to switch , exhale down .still both hands are together , reaching for the back wall .inhale to bring yourself up .then we 're going to bring both hands behind .you want to squeeze your hands together , like so .once you have your hands squeezed together , you want to try to straighten your arms by pressing down .push your hips forward , squeeze your shoulder blades together and lean back .exhale .tighten up your abdominals , come forward .then you have a nice , even stretch through the hips , working through legs and the hip flexors .
stretching the inner thigh , just find a soft surface or a mat to lay on , and focus on your feet going together , and then bring the feet right down .when you lay down to stretch the inner thigh. [CLS] [SEP]it 's important to keep your back right in the floor , so if you take your pelvis , just tilt it up a little bit , your low part of your back will stay in the floor .you can take your hands as a guide against the inner thighs , and walk those heels towards you .now guide the knees down , but your back ; your lower back is hugging the mat .breathe in deep through your nose , and exhale .each time that you take that deep breath in , you want to feel those knees going down a little bit more , but the back staying in the floor .breathe in deep through your nose , and exhale , and another deep breath in , and exhale ; keeping your shoulders relaxed , keep the hands relaxed , and just guiding those knees down towards the floor , and the back staying right in the floor ; another deep breath in , and exhale , and then just release ; bring the knees back in .
so we can either call it a stunt or a blitz .what we 're going to do is we 're going bring these guys out .now we have 8 men up against the offensive line .there 's no possible way that those guys can block everybody coming through .that makes the quarterback on the other side have a lot of pressure on him .he 's either going to have to hand it off quickly , or if he 's got to pass. [CLS] [SEP]he 's going to have to let that ball go .because we 've got eight men coming right down his throat .so we can do one of two things with our linebackers .we can bring them up , we can stunt them .and then we can bring them , or we can just bring them on a strait out blitz , and have them come hard through the gaps into the backfield to make a big play .
first of all this is a feather duster .now most people think that you know to really be an effective duster you got to move a lot .that 's actually not the case .you basically just want to brush the dust away lightly .and then also with this feather brush , you never want to shake it inside the house because it 's going to just redistribute all the dust again that you just picked up on it .so always take it outside , shake it out .also with a microfiber towel like this , when you 're dusting do n't get really aggressive like this cause all that 's going to do is stir up a whole bunch of dust .you want to just lightly swipe it so that you 're cleaning up the dust .hold it up in there. [CLS] [SEP]and then you can either take it outside and shake it .some people like to also put some spray on it to wet it down a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]so it 'll pick up a little bit more or clean it .and then you can go over it with some nice furniture polish like this and a nice clean soft cotton cloth .shine it to where you get a nice even wax coat on it. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to look really nice , make the table look new again .
to become a veterinarian i think you just basically need to be a good student especially as far as math and science goes and more importantly i think that it is very important to develop good study habits because once you get through high school and you get into college and you do n't have. [CLS] [SEP]the small class sizes you kind of get lost in the shuffle once you get to college because you do n't have the ability to go to the instructor whenever you please. [CLS] [SEP], you have to make an office hours appointment to see him to talk to him to make sure that you understand the material that is being covered. [CLS] [SEP]so study habits is the biggest thing and just being a good solid student .i think you need to be a people person .most people say i 'd like to be a veterinarian because i do n't like dealing with people .what you do n't realize when that statement is made is that all of your interaction is with the pet owner and you have to be able to communicate well with people .you also have to be able to help explain what the issues are with the pet. [CLS] [SEP]such that they understand what they are getting into as far as treatment , surgery , etc .most people practice veterinarian medicine throughout their lives and those people who want to get further education will return to school in some instances after being in practice for a few years or ten years to develop a specialty .there is internal medicine , cardiology , gastroenterology , surgery , etc .therefore it is limitless and it just depends on the motivation of the individual .
okay .if you let it dry , go ahead and put the top coat on as usual , like as you normally would .you can go ahead and brush it on .okay , to keep your art or polish from smearing , we would use something called `` floating the bead , '' which is like a big drop .i will put it on the art. [CLS] [SEP]and then i would bring it down. [CLS] [SEP]so it wo n't smear .but since everything is dry , we can just polish it .and now the art looks shiny and better .see how dull it looks before ?but then after ... [CLS] [SEP].woman : polish all of it .sue : okay .
okay , in the next two chords in this song are g-major and g-minor .i 'll play up to that .`` walked along the old canal .a little confused , i remember well .i checked into a cheap motel with the neon burning bright . [CLS] [SEP]''there 's your g. [CLS] [SEP]and then there 's a g-minor .`` i felt the heat of the night . [CLS] [SEP]''there 's your g-minor chord going back to the one chord .okay ?the difference between a major chord and a minor chord is a third .and , in this shape , we have our g-major .and then you move this note here. [CLS] [SEP]is a third. [CLS] [SEP], you want to move that down a half note to get the minor , which is a really nice cadence moving back to d. [CLS] [SEP]and , okay , people hear this all the time and say , if you were going to give it numbers , it would be the one , or the four major and the four minor .so , `` i walked along by the old canal .a little confused , i remember well .i checked into a cheap motel with the neon burning bright .felt the heat of the night . [CLS] [SEP]''and then it sets us up to come back to the one chord .
today i 'm going to talk about how do you test your eye muscles to make sure that they just wo n't work and why that is so important .like i have said , and just to reiterate , to test your eye muscles is an important step because you want to show yourself that you yourself can relax yourself .once you relax , there are many opportunities that you have as far as teaching yourself how to better focus , how to gain the skills that you want , how to help improve your self confidence , but why we test our eye muscles is to make sure that we know how to relax .so , brad , will you help me demonstrate how you test your eye muscles ?yeah .so , brad , just go ahead and close your eyes right now for me and place your focus and attention on your eye muscles to the point that they just wo n't open , to make sure that they just wo n't work .and when you 're sure that they just wo n't work because you 've decided to relax your eye muscles to that point .when you 're sure they just wo n't work , just go ahead and test them ever so slightly to make sure they wo n't work .okay , very good .excellent work .when you 're ready , just let your eye muscles open , let your eyes open and resume back in this room with us .that 's great .now , did you hear me ?i said make sure that they just wo n't work .i did n't say make sure that they will work ,because if you are going to test them to make sure they will open , that 's exactly what will happen , is they 'll open .we want you to show yourself that you can relax yourself to the point that they just wo n't work .it 's all in the language .that 's what 's most important .
it is just a beautiful shiny wig .if it is too shiny most of the time , it is not to shiny. [CLS] [SEP]but if it is too shiny for you , what you can do is take some powder and dust it through very lightly to take the sheen out .so you do n't have to have a shiny shiny look if you do n't want .some clients like it shiny and some clients would prefer not to have it shiny .so you just take it and put your powder on it , dust it through very lightly .shake it , brush through it and your sheen is gone .the color is very important .we have several colors now that she can pick with the different blonds and the different shapes .then there is different prices as well .the little longer wig here is a little bit more expensive this runs $ 99.95 .the little shorter one that she had on is called a juliet and that is $ 89.95 .so there is different prices and levels .
so we are about to begin our balancing series .balancing poses we do not just to balance our body .it actually helps us balance both sides of our brain. [CLS] [SEP]so the neurotransmitters can connect .the little highways can connect while we are under stress .so it helps us prepare ahead of time ; prevent when we are under stress- anxiety .so when you actually do the balancing poses and you 're , you know , stirring the pot with your foot and you 're opening the door with your foot while talking on the phone .no , we 'd like to not multi-task , but it actually does help us multi-task with less stress .so we are going to start with the tree pose and that , if you need , if you feel a little dizzy , especially if you are very new moms ( if you just had a baby within five or six weeks ago ) , use the wall .okay , use the wall , use the couch or use a chair and you can lean just up against it .or you can on the side and hold it with your hand .for this i 'm just going to show you away from the wall .start with tadasana , feet together , standing strong with all your points aligned .this is level one ; you can just put your foot on your ankle .the idea is to keep your hips forward and squared and push your knee open .so you are really stretching your insides .look at a point that is not moving away from you .that is far away .something that is very stationary .your eyes and your feet are connected .if you do that and try to close your eyes , your balance is all off .so gazing at a fixed point , bring your foot up and then reach your arms out and above your head .deep breath .one more .and reach your arms out and exhale .let your foot come down and your arms come down .switch to the other side .i 'm going to show you , you can bring your ankle , your foot all the way up to your knee .same thing .also , you can lift and put your foot all the way up here .and you push into your thigh .you push in with your thigh to your foot ; your foot into your thigh .open your knee .keep gazing at that point that 's not moving .exhale .inhale .reach your arms up .and reach those arms out .inhale .exhale and lower your leg very slowly and back to tadasana .
okay , let 's go ahead and finish or text .as we can see here , i 've laid the darkness part over the top .and it 's just a little bit. [CLS] [SEP], it 's white. [CLS] [SEP]it ’ s not going to do us any good really .so let 's come up here and hit our , hold on control or command and click right here in our little text document here .what we are going is , were going to change this color to black .what we are going is , were going to hold down alt and hit delete .actually , first we are going to rasterize our text so that we can actually color like that .here we go , alt , delete .and there we have it .let 's go command , deselect .and there it is .there 's our darkness jumping out .right there with a little background color like. [CLS] [SEP]so .and if we want to what we can do , is we can come through here .let 's actually blur this section up a little bit .actually let 's blur our text up a little bit .let 's go to filter , and let 's say blur .gaussian blur just a little bit .not too much really .this way it looks like the light is really kicking around a lot , around it .so there it is , there 's your text illuminated form behind .play around with it , have fun and enjoy !

this is called the panion .this panion is accurately for personal training or for transporting the bird from the house to the club .so it has the small opening in the front , on the top , where you can put the pigeon inside and you can take it out .because of the small opening on the top , the less chances of a bird flying out and escaping .so you put the pigeon inside and the thing is coming from all the three sides so as to avoid the feather getting stuck into the net and getting spoiled so it will protect the feathers from getting spoiled .in front there is one big dual as you can call it ; it can be opened .when you are going to train your pigeon , you put the pigeon inside this and you take it in your car to a point where you want to train your bird where you want to toss your bird and then after that , you just open this .as you can see , there are safety hook so that it may not open out because if it is on the way it opens out , it starts flying inside the car then the pigeon will get hurt .then you go to an open place where there are no trees or wires and all that because when they fly out they might hit the wire and injure themselves .you just open them and then all the pigeons will just come home .then they will fly and then they will navigate and they 'll try to come home .thank you .
d , e , f , are considered to be white diamonds .and as we go down to g , h , they are slightly tinted white .and when we go to i , j , they are slightly tinted yellow .and as we keep on going down the shades keep on decreasing .now , i show you just to give you a brief example , i show you the two diamonds just to know the difference between the colors .here , i have one piece which is a white diamond .this diamond is d in color .now , i show you the other piece , now i show you the other piece , this piece is j in color .now if you compare these two stones you will get to know the difference in the color of a diamond .so as the color goes up , up till d , the prices goes up , and as the color comes down to the slightly tinted yellow the prices will come down .so you can see the difference , the shade and the prices are identically proportion to each other .so now i hope you know how to choose the color of a diamond .thank you .
and , i can take these three photographs , for example , and i want to go 'start . [CLS] [SEP]'and , here 's what i want to , what i want to do .select the photos that i want to convert .these happen to be jpegs .and , i want to convert them to gifs. [CLS] [SEP]let 's say .or , i use pmgs for videos , so let 's convert these to pmg files .pmgs seem to look best on screen .here we go .and , options .you can do them interlaced or non-interlaced .you can optimize them in various different ways .and , here 's an output folder .let 's just say we 're going to do this to the documents and settings folder .okay ?so , what this will do is it will take these three jpegs and convert them to pmgs .hit start .and , you 'll see that it just automatically converts them .this is a very quick way to take a stack of photos in one format and convert them to another .three piles successfully converted .and , we 're done .that 's batch processing in paint shop pro .
ok in this clip , we 're going to talk about riding the bevel .this right here , on the back of your tool , is called the bevel , and when you 're turning the interior of a bowl , you want to make sure that you 're riding that bevel , because by riding the bevel , you 're giving the bowl gouge , the tool that you 're cutting with , support as you 're going through the cut .if you 're not riding the bevel , what you 're doing , is you 're allowing that cutting edge to be unsupported , and it can cause a catch .a catch is something that happens quite often in wood turning , and i 'll show you what a very exaggerated example , of what a catch would be .a catch would be something like that , and that stops the bowl blank , and it also puts a divot or a gouge in your wood .now if this was turning at seven hundred , nine hundred , or. [CLS] [SEP]eleven hundred rpm , that little shaving could be very , very large .more important , you could have lost control of the tool , and you could have gotten hurt ,ok ?so let me show you what it looks like to ride the bevel .you know you 're riding the bevel , if you 're getting a nice , smooth surface that trails the cut .you 've got a nice , smooth surface , because that bevel rode all the way in to the center of the bowl .
this series is about the poker variants sequence .it falls into the stud classification of poker games .just to make sure we all know how stud is played , here is a sample game of stud .it 's 2 cards down to every player at the table and then 1 card up.

[CLS] [SEP]and then there 's another round of up cards which is called 5th street .again we go with the high hand which at this time it 's ace king deuce .a round of betting. [CLS] [SEP]we 'll say hypothetically ,everybody checks and again the high hand bets the best up hand at this time is a pair of kings .there would be betting and then there 's a down card , there is one more round of betting after the down card and we see which hand is the winning hand .what we 're trying to do is take our 7 cards and make our best 5 card hand so that stud and.

after the death of a pet , its advisable to let some of the other adults in your child , or children 's , life know , to be a little extra more aware that this has happened and that your child may be needing some addition attention .or maybe acting out in different ways .you can do this in the form of just sending a note to the school .writing a short note to teachers , coaches , scout leaders , religious instructors .you can call them on the phone or let them know in person .the reason that this is advisable , also , that sometimes children are not going to show a lot of distress at home .they may not be talking to you about it .you may kind of wonder `` well boy .does n't seem like its bothering them at all . [CLS] [SEP]''maybe the case they 're just not particularly upset or they are dealing with it in a different way , through play .or it could be that some of those behaviors or emotions are going to be more manifesting in a different setting outside of the home .so it is very important to let other people , other adults know that are interacting with your child , that they , there could be some more emotional distress .there could be some need for more additional attention , that kind of thing .
this functional core exercise using the stability ball is called an abdominal crunch .basically , just come on down to the ball and make sure you have got a good balance and a solid foundation .simply walk your feet out and place the small of your back on the stability ball .make sure that your feet are hip width apart , place your hands gently behind your head , and keep your elbows wide .and you want to tuck your chin slightly and just image that you have a tennis ball between your chin and your chest .and then you want to come up , exhale as you lift and inhale as you come back .now , what can really make this exercise affective is if you image that you are snapping your rib cage close together here .never open up and really release that tension in your abdominal region .so you want to really contract and stay contracted the entire time .and exhale as you come up , inhale as you come back .exhale up , inhale as you come back .now , generally speaking you want to perform this exercise until you fatigue through your abdominal muscles until you really feel that burn .when you are finished simply sit up , walk your feet up , and that is your abdominal crunch .
now i want to encourage you , like i said in the last clip , to actively seek out information , use everyday situations to find out more about yourself , but be careful .do n't start driving people crazy asking them all the time , `` well , what did you think ?well did you think i was expressive enough ?well did you think i was assertive enough ?well how do you think i sounded ?how do you think that went with that coworker ?how ... [CLS] [SEP]''not all the time .your friends and your family are going to be great resources as well as your coworkers to help you start to understand about yourself and to improve things about yourself , but do not overdo it with the questioning .you will absolutely drive people crazy and then all of your resources will be gone .the people will be like , `` do n't ask me again .i said you were fine , '' and i 'm talking about two-ways .do n't everyday be on and on and on .no .i 'm talking about specific situations .`` was i assertive enough ? ''`` yes . [CLS] [SEP]''let it go .do n't be like , `` was i assertive enough ? ''`` yeah . [CLS] [SEP]''`` were you sure i was assertive enough ? ''`` you were fine . [CLS] [SEP]''`` well , because i do n't really know that i felt like ... [CLS] [SEP]''`` okay , i said you were assertive enough . [CLS] [SEP]''so be real careful about badgering .even though you 're excited and you 're encouraged and you 're on this huge self-improvement thing , do n't drive people nuts .
and it is very important because you need to be able to move your slides first of all for intonation. [CLS] [SEP]so you could adjust them by pulling them out or pushing them in and second of all so you could take them all the way out if you need to dump your spit .now the best way to do this i will show you so here is the slide that have got taken out of that horn .you to buy some kind of tuning slide grease that you should be able to find at any basic music store .i usually use my fingers so i can control as best as possible where the grease is going. [CLS] [SEP]but it is up to you if you rather not .you want to apply it as you are right here towards the end of the tubing , you want to apply it all the way around the perimeter like so .now once you have done that you are going to put it into the horn .now particularly when you are taking slides out or putting them back in on this side of the horn with the keys , remember to press down the key that corresponds to the tubing where you are going to be putting the slide in. [CLS] [SEP]so the pressure does not build up .if you are doing as i 'm doing here. [CLS] [SEP]you doing the side underneath which is the b flat side of the horn. [CLS] [SEP]you would press on that key and the thumb key .okay. [CLS] [SEP]so i have my first finger pressed down. [CLS] [SEP], i have my thumb pressed down , i 'm going to push the slide all the way end .now because i put the grease right at the very end of the tubing as i pushed it in the entire tubes , the entire way to break tubes without the grease .so now i pull on them. [CLS] [SEP]and i press in , out , in , and your repeat this as often necessary until you find where it starts moving much more smoothly as it did before .once you have done all of these steps go ahead and put it back to the intonation setting where you had it before and now that slide is greased and you do n't have to worry about it .
this next functional core exercise is called the front toe drops , and this is a really great exercise to work that core stabilization , so really think about your breathing and then really think about drawing that belly in .come on down to the floor and bring your arms down alongside your body .pull your shoulder blades back and down .bring your legs up into a tabletop position and then really think about lowering your lower back down to the mat .make sure that your knees are directly over your hips and that your feet are in line with your knees .let 's just start with one leg at a time .inhale as you lower your right leg down and. [CLS] [SEP]you want to make sure that you 're keeping your knee at 90 degrees the entire time .you 're hinging from the hip. [CLS] [SEP]so try not to bend your knees .inhale as you your lower leg and then exhale , really draw that belly in .inhale as you lower and exhale as you pull it back in .to take this up to the next level you can do both legs at the same time .think about squeezing your inner thighs and your knees together .then when you 're finished -for about a minute you can perform that exercise-and then just break .that is the front toe drops .
i will show you the jive change of place from right to left for men .1-2-3 and 4-5 and 6.okay. [CLS] [SEP]the foot positions for this step is left foot back , right foot in place , left foot to side , close right foot to left foot , and left foot to the side , then turn on your left foot , right foot to the side , left foot closes to right foot , and right foot to the side .okay once more. [CLS] [SEP], so left foot is back , in place , side , close , side and turn , side , close , and side .so it consist of a back rock .this is a back rock , a chasse to the left and then a chasse to the right which is turning to the left .
good , the drink we 're about to make is called sandra buys a dog .let 's go ahead and put some ice in a glass here .and we 'll measure out one ounce of dark rum .and we 're going to follow that up with one ounce of anejo rum .and let 's add three ounces of cranberry juice .and an ounce of orange juice .and a dash of bitters .let 's go ahead and pour that into our shaker here , and give it a - just a stir in the shaker , spin it around .and go ahead and pour it back in .and we 'll add a straw , and that is. [CLS] [SEP]sandra buys a dog , very tasty beverage , fruity , yet good .bottoms up .
well , if there 's one thing that you should take away from this , i think it ?s the flexibility and the freedom. [CLS] [SEP]that this method gives you .you know , you can just spend less time , drawing this entire shape and spend more time doing with your actual idea .and let say you wanted to come up with a perfect blue dress. [CLS] [SEP]and you had like six ideas that were kind of in your head that were making sense. [CLS] [SEP]but they were cloudy , you might want to put this in a piece of paper and you might want to make six of this girls. [CLS] [SEP]and then just sketch out the ideas so that you can actually come to a conclusion rather than feeling that the idea was stuck in your head and you have to stop and think and draw a person rather than a dress you know .this makes a lot easier in me , this is my preferred method. [CLS] [SEP], i hope that it helps you. [CLS] [SEP]and i hope that it ate you in getting all the ideas in your head down on paper and hopefully into an actual garment so you can be parading your own town and looking fabulous .okay. [CLS] [SEP]so good luck .
a very under rated part of the bike experience is addressing all your contact points .where you 're sitting , where your hands are and where your feet are , will really help in comfort and performance in your bike .if it 's been a while and your tape is kind of worn down. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's thin , think about replacing the bar wrap .any mechanic here will replace the bar wrap and professional wrap .it will look really clean , your hands will thank you .if you address this contact point in your saddle , we spoke a little bit about saddle choice , saddle height and position .that will go a long way because this is where the majority of your weight is on the bike , where your sitting on the saddle .lastly a good thing to look at is your feet , where you 're contacting the bike and your feet .so if you 've used the cofless peddles for the last season , it 's probably time to change the cleats .check them out , make sure there are no cuts in them .replace them as necessary .where you 're sitting , where you 're contacting the bike and your feet are really important parts of the bike that will give you a little bit extra comfort .
in this clip , we 're going to talk about what happens after the final product is finished .once it 's finished rolled , most companies will maintain them in what they call an aging room for a minimum of 45 days , but most companies go for a few years .what that does it allows the binder and the wrapper to marry , which makes more of a uniform flavor in the cigar .and once they get to you in your house , i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]sure most people have seen one of these -- it 's called a humidor. [CLS] [SEP]-- this is what keeps your cigars the proper humidity so that they do n't fall apart on you , they do n't expand .and you just want to make sure you get a decent humidor. [CLS] [SEP], i mean , you want to make sure it 's got a good seal .analogs are usually more for show ; they 're not really the most accurate humidification element that you can get .they just tell you basically what the general ballpark is as far as humidity in the box .you open them up , you look in side .most of these will have spanish cedar lining , not american cedar because american cedar is way too fragrant .it 's got a humidification device which usually uses distilled water , and then you got a nice little place to store your cigars and keep them fresh .nice little upgrade you can do for your humidor is always go with a digital .digitals are extremely accurate , more accurate say than the analog hygrometer .analog hygrometers are a plus ten to fifteen -- plus or minus fifteen percent and digital hygrometers --dead on accurate usually as long as your battery 's good .and in ending , that 's basically what goes into rolling a cigar .like i said , key element -- make sure you got yourself a good humidor .got ta keep them fresh if you want to enjoy smoking them .
now we 're going to work on putting a background image on a website .but before we do that , i 'm going to actually make a background image in photoshop. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to use this opportunity to kind of talk about file size and the rgb spectrum and other things that you need to keep in mind while you 're uploading images to the web .and so , we 're going to start. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to make a new document .let 's make it one hundred by a hundred pixels .so that 's the width and the height .and then here we 'll see resolution .and there are a couple of different ways you can check resolution on an image .but the standard for a website is seventy two pixels per inch or ppi. [CLS] [SEP]and you know , that 's a really , it 's really small compared to other image files .but since it 's going to be viewed on the internet you ca n't really tell .it 's just on a computer screen .you know , if you were to print this out that 's when it gets all blocky looking. [CLS] [SEP]and you can see the pixels .and then in the color mode we 're going to make sure that it 's rgb , as opposed to cnyk. [CLS] [SEP], that 's for printing .and it could be gray scale if you wanted it to be gray scale , but we 're just going to do rgb for right now .i 'm going to create this file and let 's say for my background image i 'm going to say want a faint yellow polka dot .and so , i 'm just going to kind of throw this together for you real quick .and there , there 's the yellow polka dot .that 's going to be my background image .
so when you go through and you read , you want to try to read off the root .so you have a melody say like this .so you can start , just go through and number 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 7 , 6 , 7 , 1 and jumps up to the 3 , 4 and 5th .so you can see the pattern now .if you go through and start with a different root with a different scale , you can play the exact same melody in every key .so you really want to go through and analyze this .now if you have some stuff in here that looks like this .say you have a flat in front of this 3 here , so that would be a flat 3. [CLS] [SEP]so you would play a g flat which is a 3rd on the scale flatted .or say if you had a natural sign , instead of playing a b flat , you would play a b natural which is the white key above the b flat .so we are going to over a little bit more on reading and writing later on in lessons .so right now , try to take it in and maybe try to write some of your own simple melodies in the key of e flat .
okay , so we just finished priming the wall and we are going to let that dry for about an hour and in the meantime our next step in our bedroom project is to do some caulking .now there are several types of caulk on the market and you want to make sure you get he painter 's caulk .some of the other brands you wo n't be able to paint over them. [CLS] [SEP]so make sure you get the right one .you want to make the cut on an angle just like that .okay , i have also got a bucket of water and a sponge here. [CLS] [SEP]and i will show you what that is for in a second .so we are just going to go around the room and a lot of times. [CLS] [SEP]where the paint meets the wall there is going to be a noticeable crack. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to fill those cracks. [CLS] [SEP]and we want to fill those cracks and make it nice and smooth .just draw a bead right down that crack just like that .so again just run your finger down the line and that will smooth it out real nice .you can even use the sponge for that .okay , now i have quite a bit of caulk left here. [CLS] [SEP]so for the next time you want to use it. [CLS] [SEP]i am going to put a little nail in the head of it and. [CLS] [SEP]that way it will stay nice and fresh .
okay , our vegetables are in the oven , roasting .our chicken is in the oven , roasting .we 've wilted our spinach .we 've boiled our cream for our potatoes .so , while we 're waiting for our chicken and vegetables to be ready , we 're going to go ahead and make our mashed potatoes .so , we 'll bring our potatoes over to the sink , and we 'll drain the water out .we 're going to keep this pot , because we 're actually going to go ahead , and mash our potatoes straight in here .we make sure that all of our burners are off , and we 're , we 're going to mash these about half way , like this , and then we 're going to come back and take our milk and butter liquid .we 're going to stir this in so that the potatoes incorporate ; all of em ' , and we 're going to go ahead and mash them down the rest of the way .
i 'm going to go ahead and spray it with some non-stick spray .then we 're going to lift up our angel cookie slowly .it should n't stick too much because of the flour .after it 's loose , you can just lift it up and just lay this on here .do the same for the other cookies .right now , we 're going to go ahead and just make 3 of them .we 're going to go ahead and throw these in the oven at 400 degrees for 6-8 minutes , or until you see that they 've become brown around the edges .at this point , our cookies have cooked .as we can see , they 're starting to turn brown around the edges .we could have pulled these out probably a minute quicker , but that 's just fine .we 're going to cover these up anyway .go ahead and pull these off .i 'm going to put them on a wire cooling rack .i 'm going to let these cool for about 30 minutes or until they 're hard .we do n't want to mess with them when they 're too soft because we put the icing on there .they 'll rip , so go ahead and get prepared .we 're going to make our icing next .
alright , the first step in making our eggplant sandwich is taking a good large eggplant is better because you want large slices .i 'm peeling it. [CLS] [SEP]and then we are going to cut it into large slabs , cut off the top and bottom first .
in this clip , i 'm going to be doing an oblique isolation .now this has no weight to it , so you can get this almost anywhere. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's a nice size as well .it 's about the size of a voided ball .ok , you 're going to sit down gently on the mat , gently roll back , and you 're going to extend both legs up .ok , take your arms to the side .now you have the option of putting the hands behind the head .you 're going to reach across past that knee , feel that oblique squeeze and then come back to your beginning position with your arm nice and open and your shoulder relaxed .exhale as you come across and reach and then take it back .now you 're going to be feeling a little bit of a burn in your quadriceps because your legs are elevated .now if you have back issues , we also have an additional option .you can take your legs to 90 degrees .that gives you a little bit more support and pushes your back a little further towards the mat .and you can also cross your ankles for additional support .now if for some reason that still bothers your back , you can always take your feet to the ground and you 'll still feel that isolation of the oblique .exhale , release .reach and release .come across and release .now our other option , 90 degrees , reach across and release .
alright , the next thing you need to remember when you 're using humor , especially a joke , but it could also be and anecdote a funny story , you must keep your eyes on your audience , when you 're talking about the humor .i 'm looking at you ,i 'm telling the joke .i 'm looking at you ,i 'm telling the funny story about my aunt bernice .whatever it is , keep your eye on the audience .what you must never , ever , ever , ever , do is read the punchline of a joke off the paper .see , i could say , `` hey where does spaghetti go to dance ?a meatball . [CLS] [SEP]''o.k. [CLS] [SEP], that works good , but i would never want to go , `` hey where does spaghetti go to dance ?a meatball . [CLS] [SEP]''o.k. [CLS] [SEP], that wo n't work .and so that 's kind of like being spontaneous .do n't read your humor off your paper .
the first thing i 'll discuss is what is an open chord and how do you play an open chord .now , an open chord is a chord that includes an open string .now an open string is nothing more than a string being plucked with no fingers on it .so , for example here , this string will be considered open .it will be closed if i had a finger on it .so , if i put my finger on it here , you 'll say that string is now closed .a chord that is opened will be a chord that involves as long as there 's one open string in the chord , it will be called an open chord .so for example as we 'll see in a minute , it 's a c chord .you would call it an open chord because you have three strings that have no fingers on them .even though , one of the strings is closed , there 's at least one string with no fingers making it an open chord .
once the mushrooms are ready we can add the green beans into the pot and continue mixing all the ingredients .then we would add the spice , just the thyme , the garlic powder , and also a pinch of nutmeg and this time we used a nutmeg grinder or you can preground nutmeg in this case .black pepper a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]and then this is the time we add the one cup of heavy cream .also a pinch of salt for seasoning and last. [CLS] [SEP]we add the fry onions because if you add them to early they would become mushy and overcooked .
don ’ t get your threads started right. [CLS] [SEP]and you cross thread it and strip it. [CLS] [SEP], then you ’ re going to have oil leaks .also the second thing if you tighten it up too tight and. [CLS] [SEP]you strip it you ’ re going to have a problem .okay , let ’ s go ahead and install the drain plug , wipe off the excess oil from the pan , i ’ m going to gently start the threads .make sure you get the threads started properly so. [CLS] [SEP]they don ’ t get striped .we got it bit and good .now we ’ re going to use a crescent wrench to finally seat the plug .remember you just want the plug snug , you don ’ t want to over tighten it because you can strip it here too. [CLS] [SEP], it ’ s snug .that ’ s how we install a drain plug .
we 've got the antennas in place , and now we 're ready to add the legs .we 're going to do that in the first loop after the head .so , we 're going to do the same kind of approach , and we 're going to pinch the loop ,on the side , small incision .we 're going to make two of those , on either side .so , i 'm going to turn this , so that we can get a good angle .pinching and cutting , and then we 're going to feed these through .you 're going to start on one side and go for the other .ok , then hopefully it comes through on the other side .you may have to feed it through from the inside of the loop .there it is .you just want to do this very carefully , not to break the paper .and we 'll do the same thing with the second leg .we 'll give him two sets of legs , feeding it through .if the loop , if the cut is n't large enough , we can always go back and change that .going back inside this paper loop and feeding it through again .and , pulling it through really gently .if your paper loop comes undone , we can always tape it back down .and now , we 're going to shape these up .and , we 're just going to give them a couple of bends , up one and then down one .up one , down one , we 'll do the same with the ones below .and there you have your legs .
alright , we 've got all this information now that we have either found out or developed about our character .now , this is so important in drama because drama is tragedy , drama is crisis , drama is serious .as human beings , we react and respond to everything because of the way we were raised , what our background is .for example , if my mother automatically yells at stuff , then i could very easily automatically yell in a crisis situation .that 's real life .so , what we 're trying to do with these dramatic characters. [CLS] [SEP]is to get them emotionally connected to real life .what is katherine 's real life ?well , katherine 's a bully. [CLS] [SEP], she 's loud. [CLS] [SEP]and she 's obnoxious .well , why ?there 's a reason for that , the way she was raised , the way she was treated by her family , the way she was treated by her sisters .well , truth be told , her sister stole her husband and so forth and so on .those events in katherine 's life is what makes her so bitter .and we want to see that emotional connection , we want to see that hurt and that anger that she feels towards cel .whereas cel is actually a much harder character , she 's hardened , she 's much more interested in herself .well , why ?she 's the middle child .everybody knows about middle children , she 's had to fight harder than anyone else .maybe her parents treated her differently .maybe katherine was mean to her her whole life .well , you have found all this information out .so , you have to present her in such a way where we , the audience , can feel empathy for her , or not feel empathy for her .we should feel , or not feel , for katherine. [CLS] [SEP]and it is the way that you present that emotional makeup , based on the history of this character 's life , that makes us feel. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's what we 're after .you , as the actor , you , as the interpreter , making me feel something .
there are a number of different ways to separate the melody notes in bagpipe music .the easiest and most simple is a single grace note and then the other most other common way is to have a grace note which are known as doublings .that gives you sort of a one , two pulse in between a note .you can play a doubling on any note on the chanter .you can come to it from any note on the chanter .so , for example , if you were playing a c doubling , you can come to it from e or f or a or any other note .and what these do is they add not only space between the notes , but sort of sometimes a bubbly effect. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's a way of breaking the music up a little bit .since the bagpipe has continuous sound and you do n't sort of pick your hand up off a keyboard and move it to another spot on the keyboard , this is a way of creating some space in the music .
normally , when you 're doing applique and hand quilting an 18-inch length of thread is about as long as you can have .the reason for that is that the thread starts to wear out and then it begins to knot , but the problem is , is that you have to keep stopping and starting and stopping and starting .an 18-inch length is really pretty frustrating because you do n't get to stitch for very long before you have to change threads .so , what we 're going to be doing today in the next step is we 're going to be showing how you can prepare thread to have a longer length to virtually eliminate your knots and make it so that you can thread your needle very , very easily .
ok , so , i 'm going around the house , and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm taking out all the nails from the walls , and as you saw before , most of my walls , in the main part of my apartment , are , are all wood .and , so , there 's really no way to fill in those holes .but , the ones , holes , when you take nails out of sheet rock , you want to , depending on the agreement with your landlord .and , but , he or she may not care if you do this or not .but , you might want to fill in the holes , in different ways .so , first , i 'm going to take out the nail , in the same way .it 's still good to use this , even though you 're not on wood , it can , your hammer can make scuff marks on sheet rock .so , it 's good to use a piece of wood still to do that .and , i 'll put this nail in my tool box .and now , there 's , you can see there 's a hole here , and there are two holes , because , i guess i was indecisive of where i wanted to put my picture .and , so , you can go to a hardware store and get some putty to fill those holes in .or , kind of a home remedy for that , if you only have a few holes to fill in , is white toothpaste .so , i 'm just going to take a tiny bit of toothpaste on my finger , and just kind of dab it in there .might need to get a little more , and it goes away .
i 'm meagan burroughs , and we are going to cover one of the most dangerous falls that are being performed right now .this is called the suicide fall .you 're going to do it out of a climb. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 're going to invert , upside down .hang on to the pole with the thighs .let go of your arms , and then you 're just going to suddenly drop at the last minute , catching yourself with your thighs .so , i will demonstrate that .and that 's the suicide fall .this next fall is called the hand sit .what you 're going to do is you 're going to climb to the top of the pole and. [CLS] [SEP]in your climbing position , you 'll be like this .you want to hang onto the pole , bring your legs up to your chest .drop your left hand down. [CLS] [SEP]and then you stick your legs out and fall .and that 's the hand sit .
alright , now we 're going to start stamping on our carousel note card .what i 'm going to be using is the in color , and it 's called soft sky .and i 'm going to do just the swirl background .when i have a larger stamp , i like to ink it up this way. [CLS] [SEP], this way i can see that i 'm getting ink everywhere on my stamp .so once it 's inked up , i 'm going to just go ahead. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to stamp about three-quarters of my design .so i 'm going to go ahead and place it there .and this is a swirl design , so there 's no right or wrong. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's exactly what i wanted .so how 's that for perfect ?now we 're going to add in the colored flowers .i 'm going to be using groovy guava , blue bayou , and what i have here is just a little flower .i 'm going to go with the groovy guava first , and i 'm just going to randomly place a few flowers. [CLS] [SEP], let 's go with three .i like to work in odd numbers .it kind of makes it really balance .i 'm just going to go ahead and clean it in between , and i like to stamp it off to make sure that my ink is removed totally from my stamp .and then we 're going to go with the blue bayou , and we 're just going to put a couple flowers again , just randomly here. [CLS] [SEP]and there and we have our beautiful design .and the next thing we need to do is place in our easter wishes .
okay on this segment we 're going to focus on your forehand slice , slash , block return of serve .when i play people , if they have a really big first serve ; a lot of times , i might just simplify my whole task of returning and block the first one .and if they miss the first one , on the second serve , i might attack it with a lot of topspin , but a lot of times when they know you are going to return it every time , because you 're just going to be blocking it ; it simplifies it .it makes them start trying to hit the ball a little harder .so actually , serving and returning , there 's kind of a little tug of war or a little chest match going on .so , i 'm going to serve from the mid court to ken 's forehand. [CLS] [SEP]and he 's just going to show how to slice it back .okay , this is the most under practiced shot in tennis and so just watch what he does. [CLS] [SEP], kind of watch it bouncing around ; and i 'm going to serve it and just block it , good and again. [CLS] [SEP]; block , move , move , move , that 's it .so , you see how that blocking it ; he keeps it low .he does n't miss it and that 's the most important thing .so , we are going to do one more and forehand .that 's excellent .so , the forehand , slice , block return is a very , very good shot because you can move it to any part of the court with control .you 're probably not going to hit a winner with it , but you can put your serving playing off balance with it .
how successful acupuncture and herbs to help you control the weight depends on how long you can stay on healthy diet and how much exercise you do routinely .why some people stay very in good shape after three to six months acupuncture treatment , while other people just put on their weight again gradually , that 's because you have to stay on the healthy diet. [CLS] [SEP], it 's not you have to be on certain diet , you have to eat healthy and especially control the sweet .because the sweets can bypass your digestive system and go directly into your blood and increase blood sugar , and increase the fat of deposits .so after you stop acupuncture treatment and achieve weight gain , weight loss , you still need to stay on healthy diet .
hi , it 's dow here at the fire house car wash.today we 're detailing a boat , teaching you how to do it like a professional would .we 're going to start on the exterior of the boat .now we 've cleaned the cover and got it removed .the first step we 're going to do is typically on a motor boat , if you live in an area like we do , you 're going to have hard water spots , you 're going to have lake scum debris on it , just all kinds of things that are making your boat not shine , not look clean .so we got running water in a hose , we 've got a bucket , soapy water .now i recommend for washing the exterior of the boat just a general purpose car washing soap , boat washing soap .this is a wash and wax auto shampoo .we put two or three ounces in a half of five gallon bucket .then we go to our car washing , auto or boat ; i keep saying car washing , but you know , boat washing stuff , like our brush , our mitt here , and were going to wash the boat. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to remove the hard water in two steps , altogether as we move around the boat .so first thing we 're going to do is we 're going to get a section of the boat. [CLS] [SEP]wet , that 's imperative .rinse it off , get what we can , then we move in with our sponge , soap and just start washing it top to bottom .again , we 're pushing debris from the top , we 're bringing it down .i like to flow back and forth the way the car , or the way the boat goes through the water .so we 're just generally washing it in this direction .get a section that you can handle , and then once you 've got that done , let 's make sure we hit the trailer too .and then we can do that later in a second step , and go around and do all the trailer .for me it 's just as easy to come down , wash the trailer , and the boat simultaneously as we systematically work around it .
okay , the crossover grip ; a lot of top pros have switched to it .in their minds , the problem with this traditional grip ; the one that a lot players on the tour use and most recreational players use is that they feel that they get too handy with it .so , the hands get too big and they ca n't control the line of the putt as effectively as they would like .so , what they 've done is instead having the right hand at the bottom and the left hand at the top. [CLS] [SEP], they 've switched them which is why it 's called the cross-handed grip .so , the left hand now goes to the bottom and then the right hand comes over the top .now , when i putt this way , i interlock my hands ; the pinky finger on my left hand with the forefinger of my right hand .so , if i ever did want to putt this way , it 's a pretty firm putting stance and putting grip .so , i can see why they would like it .so , i think it 's a pretty good thing to try .if you 're having problems putting with the more traditional grip , you can give the cross handed grip a try and try it on the practice range .and if you like it , give it a try when you play around and see it makes a difference because a lot of times putting is just a state of mind .and to have a good grip , one that you 're comfortable with can make all the difference in the world when you 're standing over those four or five , six foot power putts .
you want stay at a still position. [CLS] [SEP]so you 're a little bit past shoulder length apart .the other foot just take it out and make sure that your foot is aligned straight so you do n't want your foot aligned this way at a 45 degree angle .you just want it 90 degrees and solid position into the ground , the heal and your toe .then the other foot you are just going to basically lean on it .you should feel an entire enter thigh stretch and that is very very important and especially as a competitive cross country runner .because when you 're running that is definitely one of the major muscle groups that you are using when you are running .so you do n't want to pull on anything the next time you go out and hit the road or pavement or any course that you may be doing .then for the other side you do the same exact thing so the foot is perpendicular. [CLS] [SEP]it 's 90 degrees not like this. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's not like that. [CLS] [SEP], it 's just straight like that. [CLS] [SEP]and then you just lean .nice slow movement. [CLS] [SEP]you do n't have to be anything intense and for about 30 seconds to a minute. [CLS] [SEP], that 's it .
as telemarketer or someone in telecommunications the basic wage you can expect to make ranges , basically it depends on the program but it ranges anywhere from like a $ 7.50 an hour wage to a $ 9 , $ 9.50 per hour wage .and that will also depend on for example where i work , dialogue marketing , our basic , when they start they make $ 9 an hour. [CLS] [SEP]and if they 're in customer service. [CLS] [SEP]they 'll then ,once they graduate training they make $ 10 an hour .we offer weekend differentials .$ 1 extra on saturdays .$ 2 extra on sundays .things like that that are opportunities to make more money depending on the shift that you work .and in the outbound sourcing area where they call customers up or call potential customers up that ranges as well .they 'll make anywhere from $ 9 an hour to $ 12 an hour depending and then you can add commission on top of that depending on the program .some people will pull down an extra couple hundred dollars a month if they do really well at collecting the surveys and contacting customers .or if they are setting up contracts or setting up a new service with a customer and they do really well with engaging a new customer and acquiring their business .so it all depends .and as far as the customer service and the outbound sales field. [CLS] [SEP]it 's always expanding and growing .obviously there are limitations depending on the different laws that limit telemarketing but as a call center grows. [CLS] [SEP]and as they acquire new clients because basically how the , usually call center works , they have multiple clients that they service , some of them outbound , some of them inbound .and the way that someone can grow and expand on their career is they build up the skills to excel in the position that they 're in. [CLS] [SEP]and then they work with their supervisor to get extra responsibilities and. [CLS] [SEP]they can career path themselves into management .that way it 's very easy to learn from just watching their supervisor .their everyday duties , their managers .the ceo 's , depending on the company , how small it is , for example dialogue marketing we 'll see the ceo every couple of weeks or on a weekly basis. [CLS] [SEP]so we can view them and talk to them and interact and learn from them .so that 's how we expand upon our careers .
photoline is a registered trademark of computer insul , and i am no way affiliated with the computer insul .in this lesson i 'm going to teach you about mask in photoline .i 'm going to come over here and select my rectangle lasso tool and drag it around my cat , and that 's going to create that selection there .and if i come down to the bottom left here , you 'll see your mask options .if i select the edit mask at the top right there , that 's going to take my selection , and where it 's selected. [CLS] [SEP]you 'll be able to see , but everywhere else it 's going to be green .what you can do here , is you can come in and. [CLS] [SEP]really fine tune with the paintbrush where you want your selection to be .so i 'm going to select a paintbrush .and in my colors , i 'm going to select black .and when i come over here-you noticed instead of drawing black. [CLS] [SEP], it 's drawing that green color inside of here .and i can do just the opposite with the white .if i select white and draw on the green , that 's just going to get rid of the green .so what 's going to happen now when i un-select edit mask , it 's going to take that masking and convert it back to the lasso , there .if you select the show mask tool , you can just make that appear and disappear .and you can do the same thing with. [CLS] [SEP]the hide show lasso tool , as well , as you can see .and up above that you 've got your use mask , which you can use to turn on and off the ability to use your mask there .so that 's how you can really come in and fine tune your lasso selections using a mask .
let 's talk about vintage bicycle saddles .a saddle is really just a seat ; it just sounds more glamorous .here. [CLS] [SEP]we 've got a leather saddle .this is on an english bicycle .the saddle 's made by brooks ; a very common saddle , extremely popular ; got rivets , sometimes these are brass , these appear to be aluminum , and it 's a very , very soft , comfortable saddle .it has a metal tag on the back that says brooks , and they 're very valuable , and sometimes if you see a bike , it 's worth buying it just for the saddle .here 's a deluxe saddle on a balloon tire bike .this saddle is really worn , as you can tell , but what you see is a is a leather saddle , with a hair mattress .i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]not sure what kind of animal , probably horse .it 's got the front spring. [CLS] [SEP]the hairpin spring , and this crash rail , and this crash rail was for when your bicycle fell over .you have it parked on the kickstand , the wind blows , the bike falls , this is going to hit first , which is very important because a lot of these old balloon tire bikes had many different tanks and accessories on them , and if this absorbed the blow you might save your bike .over here , we have the classic banana seat .it 's a schwinn stingray seat , and it 's yellowed , and it has a little nick in it , but that still is a valuable seat .it also has the metal stingray seat tag , which improves its value .
the hardest , hardest day , of my being a psychic , was when i was sitting , watching `` lucy '' .and , i was about to get engaged , two days later .and i got this horrible feeling about my dad , who was so famous and so delicious .and he was at a meeting to find homes for people that were coming into the country , that did n't have any place to stay .and he came home , and i kept seeing his face with a yellow thing around it , like a haze around it .and , i stayed up and waited for him to come home .and he said to me , if you do n't get engaged honey , be brave .and he went upstairs , and exactly what i knew .he died .and that was the most horrible time of it .but it happens a lot with my family , my aunts , and my uncles .you know , i 'll say to my mother , why is aunt rosie in the hospital ?and she 'll say , she has peritonitis , how did you know ?ha , ah , ah .my mother was four eleven , but like joe frazier .that 's another one , joe frazier .i mean there 's so many people that i adore , but that was a. [CLS] [SEP], that was a rough , that was the roughest day of my life , when i lost my dad .another terrible day was when adam walsh was missing and his mother came to see me , and knowing june , dorothy alison from new jersey , who was so well known in finding children .i tried to coax her down , and unfortunately she heard me say , come on down , we 'll have fun .meaning to get dorothy alison hear me , she rest in peace .and that whole time with adam was terrible , it was a heart break .i was at the funeral , but there 's so many children that i have found that were missing , and that 's the good part .that 's the good part .
sometimes before a date , we may get butterflies .it happens .now , short of having a martini before that date , let 's look at some other methods , and one of the methods i would suggest , is that you sit down quietly , maybe listen to some quiet music , and think about where you 've been , where you are , and where you 're going .oftentimes , centering yourself by introspection or meditation , can work .five minutes will do it .another good thing to do , and. [CLS] [SEP]i think a lot of professional athletes will tell you the same thing , see yourself on that date .see yourself being successful on that date , whether you 're male or female .close your eyes , and you project into that date , yourself being with the other person , having a good time , so you 're setting your mind .it 's called a mindset for success .oftentimes , that athlete will do that , the actor will do it , and you can do it too , and it works .this is dr. [CLS] [SEP]paul .may your fantasies of today , be your realities of tomorrow .
these days we do n't really think about what we feed our cats .we just go buy whatever is in the store. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's not of ten the most nutritious solution .just like people , you can cook for your pets as well. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's good to think about what you are actually feeding your cat because this is the most important thing you can do for them .is to think about what you are actually giving them to eat .so , today i am going to start off by laying out all my ingredients .i have two cans of sardines , i have two thirds of a cup of white rice. [CLS] [SEP]and i have some parsley and some turkey liver that i am going to cook up .what i want to do first off is start by cooking the turkey liver because that 's going to take the longest .so , we 're going to get that going. [CLS] [SEP]and then we are going to do some other stuff .all these ingredients can be purchased just at your local supermarket .they are very easy to find .there is nothing here that is out of the ordinary but all mixed together. [CLS] [SEP]they are going to be great for your cat .
now i 'm going to show you how to make a `` citrus smack '' .first you 're going to take your highball glass. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to fill it all the way to the top with ice .next you 're going to add your liquors .in this drink the two liquors are a rum , so we 're going to do about three-fourths of an ounce of rum , and we 're going to do some triple sec , and the same , you 're going to do about three-fourths of an ounce of triple sec .then we 're going to add our mixers .in this drink the mixers are going to be sour mix , so we 'll fill it a little bit with sour mix , and grapefruit juice .and grapefruit juice should end up overpowering the sour mix a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]so you can add a little bit more in grapefruit than sour mix when you pour .and we 're going to want to shake this up , and i 'm actually going to shake it in my shaker .and once the condensation comes , you know it 's nice and cold and mixed , and we 're going to pour it in our glass .and for the garnish for this drink , again it 's a `` citrus smack '' , so of course we will use an orange and a lemon , and you can either add it like this if you want , or you can just stick them on the side of the glass , whatever works better for you .and that is how you make a `` citrus smack '' .
hi , i 'm emily larew .and now we 're going to do a full demonstration of our advanced hip-hop choreography .so again , if you 've been studying the clips , now i 'm not going to count it out loud for you .now we 're just going to do it together , perform it and have fun .alright ?so let 's sit on the floor .ready ?and .good job .that was our advanced hip-hop choreography full demonstration .
alright moving up to the e major scale and getting up into difficulty here .the e major scale just for fingering purposes , here we go .starting at an e we have e , f sharp , g sharp , a , b ,c sharp , d sharp , e , f sharp , g sharp , a , b , c sharp up to these ones. [CLS] [SEP]it gets a little harder a high d sharp. [CLS] [SEP]is your d key and the next upper side key , it is these two .if you can see these clearly it is d , d sharp , and then the next one is the e which is all three side keys. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 're good .that is the high e.okay , so we are going to run through this one now .take it down a little bit to 132 again here we go , one , two , three .pretty straightforward .the hardest part about that is definitely going to be your side keys and make sure that you practice that and another thing about the side keys , if you are stuck on them do n't start all the way over at the beginning of the scale again. [CLS] [SEP]you can always pick a note up high .in this case i will choose a to give us a little head start , go from a up to the high e and then come back down to a.try that a few times if you are practicing and that is obviously something that is going to hold you up to try it a few times .just a few times , you can loop it over and over and get really comfortable with it .pretty simple once you get the hang of it .give that a try and if you get stuck. [CLS] [SEP]just loop it and try it a few times like that. [CLS] [SEP]and you should be good to go .
okay our next ingredient is 1 potato. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm using a new potato. [CLS] [SEP]but you do n't have to use a new potato any kind of potato .i 'm going to peel it because the more surface area you create on a potato the more flavor from the stew broth is going to absorb .so we are just going to peel that really quickly. [CLS] [SEP]and then we are going to cube it .potatoes are not a huge component of korean cuisine but they do come in a few times and a few dishes that are yummy. [CLS] [SEP]and this is one of them .so we are going to cut it fairly thickly .potatoes are stick to cut if your knife is not wet. [CLS] [SEP]so just remember that .if you like you can cut them thicker , if you have a bigger potato you can have larger pieces it is not that important .i 'm going to put that in our pot you should get some of the water out .luckily in the stew it is really forgiving you do n't have to worry about that to much about that .okay .
m discussing once you 've decided that you want to continue to ski , the steps. [CLS] [SEP], the learning progressions starts with the bunny slope , the easier slope and then that 's with a tether .your brakes are structured behind you , tethered to you .so once you get comfortable making the turns , initiating the turns , sliding the ski. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 're controlling your own speed and linking turns one after another , that 's the progression .and once you 're doing that without the tether on the easier slope then we will move you , usually within a couple of days of lessons to a more intermediate slope where you could continue to progress and get comfortable with those turns and making the ski work for you .once you 've advanced to more of an intermediate slope , that means you 've been able to keep your shoulders down the hill , facing down the fall line. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're able to link turns one after another and control your speed and you are arcing the ski just like an able bodied skier .and then it 's a matter of continual practice and getting up as much vertical time on the mountain as you can possibly get .and as time progresses you can move forward to a little more advanced slopes where gradual is always a good thing .you never want to get in too far over your head .because again , confidence and having fun is a priority .we have individuals that have gotten so advanced that they 're obviously are competing at very high levels in the paralympics. [CLS] [SEP]and we see just amazing things out of these skiers .i do n't think i want to go back having three people to help me get on and help me get onto the lift and all that .i thought it would be a little too complicated .but they convinced me to give it a shot. [CLS] [SEP]and it was a little challenging for the first three days. [CLS] [SEP]and then i just got totally addicted to the sport .i love it. [CLS] [SEP], it 's great fun really the sensations are fantastic .
cause we want that bit of fry crispiness and that color of the frying that would give the chicken wings before we put them in the sauce and then transfer them to the oven .and you are not really frying them completely. [CLS] [SEP]you are going to finish them up in the oven so they would finish cooking in the oven .it is just like browning any other way normally browning in a skillet or a pot. [CLS] [SEP]and this way we are browning by deep frying just to get that crispiness in the chicken wings that the frying can provide .you do n't necessarily use a deep fryer you can use a deep skillet if you like .so we get a little color on those wings and that crispiness that the frying give us .so we would continue frying our wings and move on to our next step .
there are so many things that can go wrong in a kitchen .not just for babies , but toddlers and older children .there 's not shortage of accidents that can occur .in one quick second , there 's choking , burning hazards , sharp objects , suffocation , and just really so many things that can go wrong .a lot of things you might not even be aware of .there are definitely a lot of products on the market that can help you baby proof your cabinets , your refrigerators and dishwashers .we 're going to go over some of those today .then there are also some tips that you need to be aware of that are very simple to follow .for example , the kinds of things that you leave on counters .what is in within reach of your child , what your child may actually try climb up to get .you want to be really careful that you leave your kitchen in a way that if your child happens to wander in , they 're going to be safe .stick around and. [CLS] [SEP]in these next clips , i 'll give you all the advice you 'll need .
one thing that you can do is download the google toolbar to your computer , it automatically blocks pop ups for you .you can do a search for google toolbar and it will lead you to this site and you can download the google toolbar for free and. [CLS] [SEP]you can just save that to your computer and then run it .okay , it is now installing the toolbar. [CLS] [SEP]and we want to enable the page rank .the page rank will sometimes collect information for you for google purposes and since this is on our child 's account , we do n't want it to do that , so we 're going to enable the page rank and finish .now that has been downloaded onto your computer .there 's some other things you can do as well and it will vary again , a little bit depending on your internet provider , but online if we go to tools , we can pop down. [CLS] [SEP]and it says pop up blocker .as you can see our pop up blocker is enabled , so our internet provider also provides us the safe guard .another thing we can do is go to online protection and this shows us that we have , we can use antivirus ' on , our pop up blocker is on and we can turn on our parental controls. [CLS] [SEP], it shows us that they 're currently off. [CLS] [SEP]but we can turn those on and our mail protection is also on .we can go down to internet options and again on this privacy. [CLS] [SEP]and you can up this to block cookies , which sometimes enable spyware and collect information from your internet .so we can make that. [CLS] [SEP]and we hit apply .the next thing i would like to do is set our homepage to something more child friendly .i do n't necessarily want all the news and things to pop up when my child gets on the internet .so again we can go to tools. [CLS] [SEP], we go to internet options again and this is where you can type in what your homepage is .i have a page in mind that 's very child friendly , so. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to go ahead and type that in and then hit apply .for now on when you log onto the internet under your child 's account this new page will come up .
equipment .you want to have dumbbells on this .preferably what are called hex dumbbells .they 're called hex because they 're a hexagon .they 're very stable , they 're not going to roll anywhere on you. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's what we want out of the dumbbells on this .you start doing this on kettlebells or round dumbbells that can roll , this can get a little dangerous for your wrist .i prefer to keep it safe , focus on the exercise , and minimize my wrists of getting injured .i use the hex dumbbells .renegade row , this is a lot of stabilization in this exercise so body straight like a push up .we 're going to put our weight mainly on one hand , we 're going to pull up to ourself , set it down , do a push up , and then pull the other side up to us , set it down , do a push up .for those of you who have done bent over rows or bench rows , kneeling bench rows .it 's the same movement. [CLS] [SEP], we pull up to ourselves , but we have to stabilize with the other arm .it 's much more effective and much more real life than just a row .pull up , set it down , push up .you can get to the point where you can do these faster .try to pull it up. [CLS] [SEP]so it touches your body .those are a great exercise , they combine a row with a push up .we 're mainly after the row , here .if you ca n't do those right now , if you ca n't do a push up or a stabilized row like that , do n't start doing this exercise .get your push ups first , get your body rows , another exercise that we talked about in this series .get those down so you can do those before you try this .again , renegade rows done with his dumbbells .
a lot of people complain about carpal tunnel .they have the little wrist thing on , the little brace and everything , and so you think maybe it 's just because of maybe typing , because a lot of secretaries wear it .but you can get it in so many different ways .here we have a beautiful nail tech .look at the wonderful hands and everything .so the whole thing is that carpal tunnel is -- there 's a band , almost like a rubber band , inside of your hand ,okay ?and within that is all of these muscles and tendons that are kind of , like , packed in there .it 's almost like where we studied a -- when we studied the muscles , it 's almost like a cigarette pack , okay ?so what happens is you use them all the time ,okay ?but if there 's any type of inflammation , if they 're so tight , if they 're really , really , really tight , they press against each other .and if they press against each other , they press against a nerve .if they press against a nerve , they 're going to your nerves ,okay ?and you 're really going to have a lot of pain in this whole area right here .so you really do n't know which muscle. [CLS] [SEP]it 's coming from but let 's just say that it can come from a number of muscles going through the hand to innervate and kinda work your hands. [CLS] [SEP], okay ?so what we 're going to do is we 're going to focus on just a few of these muscles 'cause there 's just really so many .but just understand that you have your carpal nerve and. [CLS] [SEP]you have , again , some muscles that we 're going to talk about later on that are in this sheath. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to try to relieve those muscles .
studies will show that if you were to stick a light switch on your core while you 're doing this both front. [CLS] [SEP]and back. [CLS] [SEP]it 's really going to light up .so we 're going to come down and again , master your basic attempts before you move into controlling all of this momentum with bicycler crisscross .now we want to lift into neutral cervical posture .bring our knees into table top position , 90/90 over the hips. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to think of bringing , leading with our chest. [CLS] [SEP]so we 're not crossing , even though you hear the word crisscross , we 're actually working into the obliques , but we 're going to control all the momentum with our whole body as one unit .so we 're leading without chest , we 're not twisting and leading with the elbow , not even really the shoulder , and we crunch and release. [CLS] [SEP]and then simultaneously we crunch and release the other side .now how far you extend your legs will depend on how much you can control keeping your nice neutral pelvic posture with your back into the surface that you 're working on .so as we 're coming in as a result of contraction in the obliques , not as far as twisting .so we want to see a nice line between our chin and our chest bone .and inhale , exhale .inhale , exhale .i do n't need to go any further than that to really feel lateral flex in my obliques kicking in .rotation is not the way to work obliques .that 's just tweaking out the spine .to really focus in on the area you want to hit you 've got to control the momentum and crunch and release , crunch and release .you can speed that up as long as you can control the momentum but usually nice and slow is much harder to work with .
i 'm a master instructor at the jim mclean golf school in miami florida .in this clip we 're going to talk about , how to choose the correct sand wedge .the very important thing to know about the sand wedge , is that all sand wedge have what is called a bounce .a bounce is where the club , is what we 're going to use to hit the ground or the sand .and the more bounce the club has , the more the club is obviously going to bounce .if you 're playing in a court that has very soft bunkers and a very soft surface , you need more bounce , for the club to react against the sand , the soft sand .if you 're playing on wet grass , or bunkers that does not have much sand , you need less bounce .for example , with the tyler 's club they show different numbers , and these numbers come from 4 to 14 , this is a middle bounce , because it 's a 08.so many two players travel and they have the same club with different levels of bounce , and depending on the golf condition , how hard , how soft it is , they 're going to pick the right one for that week .this is julio nutt at the jim mclean golf school , just talking a little bit about , how to pick the right sand wedge .
now , we 've talked about monotone , which is using , you know , you do n't want to be monotone , which is using just one pitch .you want to use those two or three pitches .but another vocal expression that you want to think about is rate of speed .and when i 'm talking about rate of speed , i 'm talking about moderate , fast , or slow .now , generally , most of your speech is going to be moderate , or it should be .we tend to go a little bit faster when we 're nervous , so you want to be very aware that you 're speaking in a moderate pace : not too slow , not to fast , where people can understand .but there are certain times when you might want to go a little faster .or if you 're really trying to drive a point , you might slow down .so remember , in addition to using those two to three different pitches ; you 're going to want to use two to three different rates of speed .
the next type of waxing is what 's known as the hot wax .this is the traditional method used first with skis for centuries and for snowboards now .i do n't have an iron .i just , i usually use this all-condition paste .they do make temperature specific and condition specific waxes , but your safest bet is just to get an iron-on all-purpose wax .and if this was your iron and this was the wax. [CLS] [SEP], you want to do exactly what you do with the rubdown .again , drool it like you were to drool the epoxy across .keep going in an s along the whole course of the board .take your time , because the wax is extremely hot , and if it gets on your clothes or your shoes or anything ; they are ruined .once you 've trickled it all over the board , you 're going to take the iron , and just disburse it evenly across the whole thing .it does n't matter if you go tip to tail or side to side , because you 're just trying to get everywhere covered .you want to give it a few seconds to dry off .take a scraper and just take a look at the board .sometimes you hold it up to the light ; get a good angle at it , and you can see bubbled areas .scrape off the excess. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're all set .
over here we have pump parts to replace a lot of different things that can go wrong with your pump that is really simple to replace and most stores have those .here we have skimmer baskets and these are most of your maintenance supplies ; your skimmer net , your vacuum , your rakes your brush , rope and floats , thermometers , repair kits , just different things you might need from time to time to replace .and if you were to have problems you know. [CLS] [SEP]of course we have your test strips. [CLS] [SEP]so you can test your water before you bring it in and sometimes it easier to do that before we have ultimately big problems the homeowner can catch them their self .like the pool we were just at , last year it had a really big phosphate treatment and most people do n't know you can buy phosphate kits. [CLS] [SEP]but you can .a lot of stores do n't have them out because we did that ourselves. [CLS] [SEP]but if you have phosphates , these products here are really good products to help get rid of the phosphates and most people will have some type of chemical plan , five day chemical treatment that you can use to take those phosphates to your filters so that you can backwash them .if you were to have any type of metals , we have metal products that will take the metals out of your water also and we have here chlorine tablets ; most people use chlorine in their pools .a lot of people do n't like the people that i just treated it is a non-chlorine chemical and can be used as a stand alone non-chlorine chemical or you can add chlorine tablets to it .for instance like i have this in my pool at home and. [CLS] [SEP]last year i had a bunch of 15 year old boys swimming in it and it ended up pretty cloudy. [CLS] [SEP]so i put a couple of chlorine tablets in my dispenser or my floating dispenser or my in line chlorinator and overnight the cloudiness was gone .but we have all the products you need ; stabilizers , ph minus , algaecides , shocks , clarifiers .most places any time that they do n't have something that you need , they have a local distributor somewhere. [CLS] [SEP]that they order from that they can get pretty much anything at any time .that is how you open a swimming pool for the swimming season and that will be all for now and hope everything goes well with your swimming pool and maybe we will have some programs in the future to where if we have a really bad pool like some of the things we talked about , phosphates , we can do another segment on those and have a good swimming season .thank you .
i 'm going to talk to you about how to replace an element in the oven .in all your typical ovens you have a lower element and an upper element .and these plug in to the main electrical source in the back of the oven .and to replace these all you need to do , there are two quarter inch hex head screws that hold the security plate in place .and i 'm not going to remove this particular one because you do n't want to remove an element if it 's a good element .so we 'll just do this for demonstration purposes .but you would unscrew these two screws here and then slide that element out .now of course it 's very important to make sure that your power is turned off whenever you do this .so you want to go to your main breaker , identify the breakers for your oven and you want to turn those breakers to the off position .anytime you 're dealing with any kind of electrical elements , something like that , you want to make sure that that power is cut .so , once you remove that , then you can take that element and you can take it to the home improvement store , you can take it to the place where you actually purchased your appliance and they should be able to help you match up with a similar element to come back in .but it 's really more or less just an unplug and plug in type of operation from when you do that .and that 's all there is to it .so i 'm tim gipson and that 's how to replace an element in your oven .
no that 's different video .fresh mushrooms , very important , you are going to chop them , a tablespoon of butter , 2 tablespoons of chop onions , that is about a 1/2 of an onion i would say , 2 tablespoons of flour , a cup of half and half of milk. [CLS] [SEP]and i like to use half and half , and just some parsley to taste , also some salt and pepper to taste .you are also maybe going to save one ( mushroom ) for garnish , just to garnish the soup. [CLS] [SEP]and that is it .it is a quick easy soup .when i come back i will show you how to chop some mushrooms .
all right this is a penstemon .it 's quite a pretty plant .pretty flowers. [CLS] [SEP]but as you can see here it is lopsided and the plant is growing in only half the pot .this is due to being watered primarily always from the same side .from the greenhouse we are not going to go and turn every pot. [CLS] [SEP]but that is really in the home environment what you should be doing or else. [CLS] [SEP]you are going to end up with something like this .so it is best to water from different places. [CLS] [SEP]so hopefully you will get a nice full plant .try to make it look full .try to spread out some of these little branches and encourage it to go over there and try watering it from a different side .so if you have plants in a window , this is probably typical because you are always watering it and just turn your plants once in a while and give the other side a chance .it will be nice and full all around .
hi. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm bobby larew , your expert on diving .talking about how to spot for an inward 1 1/2 pike .o.k. [CLS] [SEP]?after we 've pushed off the board , we 've gotten into our nice , tight pike , we 're beginning to rotate around .what you should be doing with your head is having your head up a little bit so that you can see with your eyes , that should be open , all the stuff that 's spinning around and around and around in the air .alright ?an inward 1 1/2 is very easy to spot because what you 're spotting is actually the water .o.k. [CLS] [SEP]?the water is never moving , it 's not going to go anywhere , it 's not going to change places , somebody ca n't pick it up and move it .so , if the water 's always there , the water is what you 're trying to spot .now , you should only see it one time .o.k. [CLS] [SEP]?as you come around for your inward 1 1/2 , you should just see it one time .you 'll pass it twice , but , second time is the time that you see and you spot .alright ?now , when you spot the water , that 's when you know you 're ready to come out .o.k. [CLS] [SEP]?if you do n't see the water , do n't come out of an inward 1 1/2 .that 's spotting .
all right .so we 've got another one in our variation of eighth notes .we 're going to be playing on the downbeats of one , two and four , and then we also are going to put an upbeat on four as well .so we 're going to have kind of a drive into one .you 'll hear it -- musically , this is what i 'm talking about .all right ?so anytime you have that upbeat of four. [CLS] [SEP]and then the one. [CLS] [SEP], that 's kind of when the beat is heavy on , like , one and three .that 's like where the emphasis is going .that 's where it 's going to come in handy to put an eighth note on the upbeat of four to kind of land back on one. [CLS] [SEP], kinda emphasize that `` uh , uh , and one . [CLS] [SEP]''so what 's lining up here. [CLS] [SEP], we 've got downbeats of --well , downbeat of one , you got kick and hi-hat ;downbeat of two and four , you 've got kick , hi-hat and snare .so you got those heavy backbeats in this beat .and then you 've got the upbeat of four ,just the kick and the hi-hat lining up , all right ?so take a look at the next clip .we 're going to play -- we 're going to put the hi-hat back in .i 'll play it for you for a little while so you can get a feel for what 's going on , and then we 'll try it together .
alright now i am going to show you how to do the batma to the side , front combination .remember it 's very important whenever you are lifting you leg up to the side. [CLS] [SEP]is far away .whenever your leg goes high , your side is going to want to come down , but really focus on staying engaged .let 's get the engaging breath before you have any movements .so it 's an inhale , big ribs , exhale , ribs are down .so you are squeezing through the center in the front , squeezing also through the back. [CLS] [SEP], you hands in front of you for support .the first movement starts with a slight rotation , through the thigh so that you can lift your leg height , up to the sky .so you are going to lift if up , drop , and close .so you are lifting up , there is your rotation , it 's a quick lift , focus on the side , drop , and then close .so it 's lift , drop , close .lift , drop , close .quick , slow , and then a focused lengthening slow movement to the leg .you really got to breathe , if everybody is groaning at the end and you are out of breath , you are not breathing , check yourself .make sure you are breathing , focus ,you 've got eight or ten to make it perfect. [CLS] [SEP]so there you go. [CLS] [SEP], that 's your combination , side , front , batma .
so just lightly mix all of your wet and dry ingredients in the bowl here .and with that wonderful ladle , whoops , what you 're going to do is you actually ladle in half of the mixture on the bottom of your pan , and it 's going to be really juicy and really wonderful .but this is actually going to create the bed for the fish .and the reason that you 're ladling this and you do n't even have to oil your pan is because of that wonderful , rich olive oil that 's here in the sauce itself .so once you 've got about half of this on here , you 're going to take your fish fillets that have been salt and peppered. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to gently layer them all the way across the mixture .these are gorgeous big , fat fish fillets .this is going to be delicious .and then with the balance of the mixture here , just ladle it over the fish .my grandmother would be so proud to have me sharing this recipe with all of you .so wherever you are [ ph ] yaya fortini , this one 's for you .and just very simply finish off your dish .and it 's ready to go in the oven .and it 's going to bake for 50 minutes on 375.so hopefully , your oven has been pre-heated to 375. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to cook this dish for 50 minutes .
basically what you want to use is acrylic paint .regular acrylic paint is good .acrylic paints are flexible .they 're all flexible .alright , for your canvas sneakers , let 's just see here .it looks like there was some stencil work .with stencil work you want to use like airbrush , which is a much cleaner work .you do n't want to use a brush with a stencil .it 's just not good .it wo n't come out like. [CLS] [SEP]you want it to .with the canvas you want to use the acrylic with a brush .make sure the brush is a little stiffer , not too soft .just your brush and your acrylic and your sneakers and your creative , you know images and your detail and. [CLS] [SEP]you should pull it off .
with inks and writing fluids we have lots of choices .if you go to an art store you 'll probably see lots of different kinds .the thing that you want to look for , is to look for an ink that 's designed for pens not for a painting or not for drawing .and , i recommend an ink , and. [CLS] [SEP]i 've got lots of inks here to show you .higgins makes a lot , windsor newton , there 's india ink which is used for drawing , and sumi ink which is particularly nice for calligraphy because it has a thick sort of viscous texture .and when you put it into the pen it makes a nice , very black , dense line .you can see i 'm getting the thin strokes as well as the thick strokes from this pen .so , with the inks you really have lots of choices .i recommend black ink simply because you do n't get distracted by the density of the ink as you 're writing .
lastly on our board right here we had a little bit of moisture go through the siding and actually start to rot the wood behind. [CLS] [SEP]so what we did we scrap away all the rotted wood. [CLS] [SEP]and then we put sealer on top of that to make sure that there was no more moisture that would get in and damage that .now that our wall studs have been prepare we are now ready to inspect the installation .
well a lower end mattress you can expect to pay in a queen size about two ninety-nine to four ninety-nine .this is a perfect example of a lower end mattress .you have your firm right here with and also you know a mock pillow top , a pillow top that does n't have a lot of padding in it .what they do in a lower end bed that they do n't do in a more expensive bed is they lower the coil count .you can expect to have about three hundred and twelve coils in a queen size set in the lower end .and after that they do n't have as much filling material. [CLS] [SEP]so you 're you 're not going to have enough padding before you hit the coil system .and and you get pressure point .you 're not going to get pressure point relief on beds like this .and so that 's why they 're less expensive .they 're using less expensive filling materials and less inferior quality coils .they wo n't last long as long .and then also they wo n't be as comfortable over a long period of time .so those are the basic differences .
now there are several ways that you can clean a felt hat .one of the ones that you will hear recommended is brushing and i 'm going to show you as we brush along the brim of this hat. [CLS] [SEP], it is tremendously effective , it lifts all of the dust off more or less and gives you a good clean look to that hat , brings the color back , kicks the dust off but does not distort the shape .now what you want to keep in mind when doing this is not so much the technique , it is really just simply brushing it as the brush itself .this is a sea horse brush. [CLS] [SEP]and i 've been using this , it has got a real soft bristle and in other words the bristle is stiff when you push it this way but to the touch it is very soft .and the reason that is important is that a good felt hat is with you for a life time .these will last 20 years in this case about 35 and sometimes more .so you want to think long term when you are handling your hats .is this hat being damaged by what i am doing ?so you want a bristle that is soft enough to flick the dust away but is not actually scratching into the mat of the felt as a very hard bristle brush will do and that can be very damaging to the hat in the long run. [CLS] [SEP]so i recommend that you avoid it .
now the same holds true that we just discussed for the previous key for this key , g flat .g flat is f sharp. [CLS] [SEP]but sometimes you are going to see a flat minor .you are not going to see g sharp minor .so let 's think of it that way for a moment .a flat to a d flat scale with a lowered seventh , the lowered seventh being c. [CLS] [SEP]so it goes to c flat which is b.so you 're thinking of it as a g flat scale , g flat to a flat to b flat to c flat and d flat , e flat and then f and then g flat .
you want to make sure you have room to hold things like shopping bags and diapers .you want to make sure your bag is big enough to carry everything you want .you want to make sure that you have a clutch for the club .you want to make sure that you know how to carry that bag and to match it to your clothing .remember that patterns are important , color is important , matching it with your lipstick can be very cool and remember price is important but if you want to keep it for a long time then going out there all the way for the price. [CLS] [SEP]is kind of a good idea .so remember have fun with your handbag. [CLS] [SEP]and i hope you enjoyed it .
in this step , we 're going to take a look at how to use our timpani mallets on the cymbals , and talk about some advantages and disadvantages of using the timpani mallets on the cymbals .first , disadvantage .that 's kind of too knocky for me .it just does n't sound very good .but what you can do if you want that ride cymbal sound , flip it over , and lightly you can do it , and you can kind of -- you can still get the bell sound. [CLS] [SEP], you can still get the middle .if you wanted to play a beat with the mallets , or if you wanted to do more of an attack type of cymbal roll , you can flip them both over .now what i really like about the timpani mallets , they sound great on the drums , but they 're the best things to use for a cymbal roll .just , it 's a really nice -- it helps you crescendo , and you 're not hearing the beads of the sticks .you know , if we flip them over , you can actually hear the knocking of the stick on the symbol , kind of takes away from the overall feel of the cymbal roll .or , this , which is just so nice .so , those are some advantages to using the timpani mallets .really killer cymbal rolls .maybe a disadvantage , maybe not conducive to playing a beat on the cymbals .those are the disadvantages and advantages of using timpani mallets on your cymbals .
and i 've written a book on `` how to become a professional bachelor . [CLS] [SEP]''i 've talked to you about supermodels .and what is it that a supermodel looks for in a man ?people have asked me that tremendously .i have dated supermodels and i have interviewed countless of supermodels .and surprisingly , after studying this behavior very , very intensely , i came up with three conclusions .number one : the first thing a supermodel looks for in a man , `` is he honest , and does he like his mother or his family ? '''cause by displaying those ethics , one believes that you are a true man or a true nice guy , and that 's what supermodels want .number two : humor , humor .most supermodels say that most men have no humor , do n't make them laugh , do n't make them feel good , and they do n't care what they look like .they are looking for a man who can provide some good humor and comedy and take the stresses out of life .and most importantly , manners ; manners never go out of style .i talk about it in my book all the time how to become a professional bachelor and how to develop good manners .it 's a skill that 's required and needs to be practiced every day .women really look for men with good manners .if you achieve those three minimally , the supermodel will be looking at you and , surprisingly , will even seek you out .so listen men : behave , have manners , have good humor , and be affectionate and warm and honest , and you 'll get the women of your dreams .
there are a couple of different formats that insect repellents are available in .one of them is lotions , the other being sprays .sprays break down in a couple of different formats .you have the pump spray and you have an aerosol .as we discussed earlier , aerosol is not the best format , because aerosol does contain alcohol .alcohol does dilute the pours of your skin , which increases the absorption of the active ingredient in your insect repellent into your skin , and you do not want that to happen .you want the insect repellent to float on top of your skin , because once it absorbs down in there , it becomes ineffective .these two particular sprays , the pump sprays , are oil based , so they 're going to be a little greasy , a little oily on your skin .the 100 percent deet obviously is like the mac-daddy , it really , really , really works with mosquito 's , but it is a little bit oily .the two lotion based , are more skin friendly , they go on , they have a lower odor , they do n't stink as badly , your typical insect repellent odor , and they 're a little more skin friendly , in terms of how they feel on your skin .but they all work , in certain application .the only one that we do not recommend of course , is the alcohol base , the aerosol , which you ca n't take on a plane anyway .so that pretty much sums up the different formats .
are you looking for something designer ?or something just casual and every day ?for instance , if you want something with a more designer look to it , maybe some nice whiskers along the side , or some nice wear and tear along the pant leg , you can go ahead and just type in designer jeans or maybe even the specific type of design you want .; type in jeans with whiskers .you 're going to get a lot better search results .additionally , you look for various sorts of wear or wash , such as an acid wash jean or perhaps a non prewash jean .maybe you just want the cleanest , nicest denim you can find .go ahead and type in as specific as you can when you 're looking .the closer you know to. [CLS] [SEP]exactly what type of jean you want , the better result you 're going to get when you 're looking online .some people need jeans for working ; maybe a carpenter jean or something like that as an example .go ahead and again type in the exact type of jean you 're looking for .type in carpenter jean .type in the purpose of the jean you 're looking for and you will get much nicer results , that way when you need some sort of working jean. [CLS] [SEP]you 're going to get something more like this sturdier denim , than something that like that has been pre-worn. [CLS] [SEP]just so it has a nice , fun designer look to it .
hello , and thanks again for joining us .now i 'd like to share with you the many important reasons , and explain why it 's extremely important to replace the protein that you lose when you work out .there 's multiple types of ways to be able to do that .a great protein shake can do that in the flavor of your choice .some protein drinks have more grams of protein in them than others , so the ones that have the highest amount , of course are the ones that will help to replenish that protein level faster .there 's multiple types of bars that are out there that you can choose from for any types of flavors and the things that you like , and to suit your tastes .there 's many things that you can do when you go home or go out to eat to making those correct choices of why it 's so important for you to eat and replace that protein , so that you can build that nice lean muscle .so , lean lean meats is a wonderful thing to use , fish ; not fried , stay away from the fried stuff .you want to keep it healthy , keep that protein natural and beneficial to you .not to have to combat other elements that you put in your body .so , keep that protein up .you you 'll build nice lean muscle , and you 'll feel so good for doing it and treating yourself healthy too .so thanks , and we 'll be right back .
instead of using a pretty much time consuming program , such as microsoft frontpage , dreamweaver and some of those .these have already been developed , so you just point and click and move it around where ever you want it .so , we 're going to take a look at websites one , which is a well known one out there that a lot of people use .but before you even begin the process of developing a website , you want to think about what it is that you are going to be marketing , what you are going to be saying .if you 're going to be selling something online , or if you just want to put out general information .so get all those thoughts down first , and then you can begin manufacturing your own website , ok ?ok , and as i said , we 're going to be taking a look at websites one , and there 's a lot of features and benefits to this particular one , and as you see on this screen , build a business website in under five minutes , and that 's just about how it works .so in our next segment we 're going to take a look at building a website through websites one .
you can compete anywhere from middle school all the way up through high school .there are other squads that are designed strictly for the purpose of competition .these kinds of squads you only want to tryout for if you are very serious , you have a lot of time to dedicate and maybe have the hopes of going to college on a scholarship some day .with competitions you are going to require to practice at least 4 day a week , travel , spend additional out of pocket money .so if you are under 18 , make sure you have the permission of your parents before getting involved in something like this .also make sure you have the time dedication and skill to compete .
okay over here we 're going to do what we call incline bench press .it 's the bench obviously. [CLS] [SEP]that 's inclined , it 's going to work on your chest and at the same time it 's actually going to work on your triceps as well .the primary goal of this exercise is the chest .upper chest development , your going to lay down , make sure your back is flat .do n't arch your back or anything like that .keep your back flat tightly against the pad .you can put your knees up if you 'd like , your feet up like this .that takes the pressure off your back .lay back , there 's a little thing that you want to be able to grab , just a little wider than your shoulder width .grab it here like this , you can put them around this way or that way , it does n't really matter .i prefer this way .it does n't make a difference as far as exercise .go from here , bring it up slowly , slowly bring it down .you want to touch the chest , feel the chest , and bring it up .you do n't want to bring it up like to where you lock your elbows in .keep your elbows bent at all times .you bring it down , slowly inhale like a cylinder , bring it up to here .do not bring it up like this , you 're just going to lock in your elbows and put too much pressure on your joints .you do n't want to do that .bring it down , just slowly , and bring it up , down , and make sure you keep breathing throughout .you should be able to do at least eight to twelves. [CLS] [SEP]reps.again , you always want to warm up with light weight , and you increase the weight as you get warmer and stronger .why are you doing the incline bench ?it works in the upper chest development which is usually harder than the other part of the chest .that 's why it 's good to do this part .most people have problems getting upper chest development , and that 's why you want to do this thing .it 's also actually less pressure on your shoulders , believe it or not when you do this one as opposed to flat .not many people do flat bench press anymore .they used to back in the seventies , but they are paying the price today .so you bring it in , slowly touch your chest , just bring it just here .you do n't want to bring it down to here , but bring it just below your chin .touch your chest and bring it up .and , when you 're done , just gently put it back .there you go .that was easy , right ?
we are going to be doing a plank with the inflatable ball .you are going to come down slowly on to your mat or exercise area .lower yourself on to your stomach. [CLS] [SEP]and now we are going to take our inflatable ball. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to place it between our legs .now what we are going to do is we are going to rise up into a plank position and squeeze the ball .this is going to add an extra component of resistance. [CLS] [SEP]so you are going to feel a lot more in the inner thighs .you are going to keep your back nice and long .now of course this is the basic position .if you want more of a challenge you can come up on your toes .pick up a focal point , tighten up the abs in the back .come back down to our basic .now in the basic you can also cross your ankles if you need that additional support .also it is just keeping the feet together , keeping the body nice and long and tightening that core .now i usually hold my planks for anywhere from 15 seconds to a minute .for beginners you may only be able to hold it for 5 or 10 seconds but just do a couple of sets until you build up your endurance , and relax .
something that you always got to have if you are playing down low is `` rebounding '' .you got to have that during a game , if you are not a good rebounder then are probably not going to play you in the paint .whatever position you play on the court you , you got to know how to rebound .for the basics of rebounding , i am going to show you , i am going to take you down here to the rim .whenever i am trying to rebound , i always want to keep my eye on exactly where the ball is , i do not want to take my eye off the ball at anytime , once the ball hits the rim. [CLS] [SEP]and it is on its way down. [CLS] [SEP]i want to already spotted my man on the court that i am supposed to be boxing out .we are going to talk about boxing a little bit later , but after i box the man out , i want to make sure i am looking for the ball , always looking for the ball relentlessly .no matter where the ball is i am after it .so , if the ball comes off the rim , i want to always rebound , bring the ball to my chest and turn around protecting the ball so i can see where i need to pass it to and where i need to get the ball to .so , you have different points in the game , you might have to run after the ball to get the rebound , get the loose ball .but if it is coming off the backboard or the rim , you always want to keep your eye on the ball and try your best to reach up as high as you can and grab it with two hands .you want to grab the ball with two hands when you can , sometimes you can not , but you want to grab the ball with two hands tight , so no one can get it .grab with two hands , come down and look , survey the court to find out where you need to pass it or whether you need to advance the ball .there you have it , `` rebounding '' .
alright , so this is the club , very straight forward .in this clip we 're going to be drawing a cousin of the club but ones a little bit more dangerous and deadly , i would say , it takes a little bit more skill to use , it 's called the flail .i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]not sure what it is , you 're going to find out .we 're going to come down here and draw it right here in this corner .the flail , in name , actually makes quite a bit of sense , once you see the final product .it might be a little bit confusing at first but believe me , once you see what it is we 're drawing here , you 'll understand completely .first you 're going to draw a little staff with a little bit of a loop at the end .maybe give it a nice leather strap thing winding down and a little handle at the bottom , something to hang on to .then what we 're going to do is we 're going to come out here. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to draw some chain link .i think you might be starting to see where this is going .incidentally , just on a side note , when you 're drawing chain link , try not to draw too much detail to the inner portion of the chain link .draw the lines thick on the outside then on the inside .now the fun part .it 's a little ball , not just a little ball , this ball comes equipped with a variety of charming spikes guaranteed to inflict a great deal of pain , if it happens to hit you anywhere .that , my friends , is called the flail .i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]sure you 've seen it many times , in many different situations but these things are not to be fooled around with , they are incredibly sharp and can do a lot of damage if they hit you in the right spot .so , there you go. [CLS] [SEP], that is the flail .now we 'll move onto some more weapons .
like i said from a colonic you could feel more energy , better digestive , regular bowel movement , you could have clearer skin , improve sleep , increase sex drive , less lower back pain. [CLS] [SEP]so sometimes when you think that something is n't even directly caused by constipation or accumulated buildup in your colon , it could be .so it is definitely good to cleanse every once in a while .if you have a serious condition , always consult your physician before performing a colonic .also if you have active colon cancer , diverticulitis , recent colon surgery , i do not recommend colonic .depending on the medication , you are usually fine .it is just pure water that is flushed in and out of your intestine .i personally do n't recommend doing colonics when you are pregnant .i did n't and there are some places that will perform one but. [CLS] [SEP]a colonic is a purging reaction .you are getting your body to purge the toxins. [CLS] [SEP]so when you are pregnant i do n't think it is good to get your body into a purging mode .so i do n't recommend colonics when you are pregnant .
tip number 12 :mixing styles .like with mixing metals , mixing styles of jewelry can be a fun way to get a little bit more complex with your jewelry .this is definitely a more advanced technique , and not something we necessarily would recommend doing immediately off the bat as you begin to select jewelry .however , since we 're talking about how to choose jewelry , it is important to incorporate the notion of how to mix styles of jewelry .whether they 're styles that you already have , or styles that you 're shopping for at the time , choosing your jewelry every morning is always an exercise in exploration .depending on your mood and how you feel on a given day , you may feel like mixing one style of jewelry , for example antique , with another style of jewelry , for example costume jewelry .the best way to do this is to try and keep one singular theme running between all of the styles .so , using our example of antique and costume jewelry , find some antique jewelry that has some stones or one color of metal and then select your costume jewelry also with a similar stone or metal .it does n't have to be the same color of stones .just the fact that it 's stones is enough .or if you have a bunch of different kinds of jewelry that have different styles but all similar colors , then that can be your single theme .to keep a consistent theme running among your jewelry when your mixing styles will keep it from looking messy and make you look neat , but still intricate .
but what is also recognizable on this painting that he grabbed back to the old tradition of painting adam and eve in life size , full body to the old german and netherlandish paintings like van eyck or other german painters from the 15th , and other german painters from the 15th century .and it has the message that after the creation adam and eve were completely naked and standing lonely in the nature .it shows not only the woman power of eve but the loneliness of the human person in the nature .
and we are going to actually cover that with a piece of foil .once we put our chicken wings in the sauce , we are actually going to transfer to this sheet and because like i said they are going to sticky with the sugar mixture in there. [CLS] [SEP]so we are actually going to spray this sheet with a little oil just to try to keep them from sticking .once you put them in and get them in there. [CLS] [SEP]and they do stick , just you know let them cool down a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]and you should easily be able to pry them off the foil but the oil itself should keep them from sticking too much .any way we 've got our pan ready and let 's move on to our next step .
on behalf of expert village this is mario amaya teaching you impetu . [CLS] [SEP]first we would focus on the right hand . [CLS] [SEP]( playing guitar ) now we would focus on the left hand . [CLS] [SEP]( playing guitar ) please see the next video in this series for the next segment of impetu .
and you want something that will say , its comfortable , which is always a nice thing to have in a boot .well , you know there 's a lot of copies out there , but the ones that are , that i like to use , and a lot of people like to use for style and comfort , is this areas area .a lot of people swear by these boots .the comfort system is that they are built on a nike frame .and they use a carbon fiber shape which is really nice .they are , if you want to go , you know , they are kind of old run , if you want to stand around the whole day in your boots and not have to take them off , they 're great for that .if you want to go from in and out of the house , snow weather rain , they 're built for that , which is basic for really nice for real great starter boot , if that 's what you 're looking for a nice cross-over boot .
in this clip we 're going to show you about the all important foul against a foul , a jump shooter .alright .there 's proper ways to foul a jump shooter .alright .the offensive player is going to shoot a two-point shot. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 'll show you the difference between foul in a two-point jump shot and a three-point jump shot .okay .so again , the defender is going to play defense against the jump shooter .the offensive player is ready to shoot .he 's going to go for the shot. [CLS] [SEP]and this player is going to strike his elbow , okay , which gives him a foul .a cardinal sin in basketball is not to defend , i mean not to foul a jump shooter .you learned that from the kindergarten on up , never foul a jump shooter .but it 's just a case you do , let 's show the difference of between understanding what a player is on the floor .if he 's behind this key , if you foul him , you give , you 're going to give him two options .if he shoots , you foul him and he makes the basket , that 's what we call an opportunity for four-point play , very rare in basketball .however , but if he misses , he goes to the free-throw line , he gets three foul shots for you foul him for that attempted jump shot .okay .so , play a proper d , he 's going to foul a jump shooter behind the line , foul , which makes him misses the ball , misses the basket .okay .the referee is going to grant this man three free throw shots , all because you foul a three point player .okay .alright .now the difference between fouling a three-pointer. [CLS] [SEP], i mean fouling a jump shot shooter who 's shooting a three-pointer and a jump shot shooter who 's fouling , shooting a three , a two-pointer , is just a mere feet , foot or so .so if he steps within the key , which we i explained earlier , the key is within the kiosk within the semi-circle , anything beyond it is called a three-point shot .so , the defender is going to play defense against his jump shot .and in this jump shot , he 's going to foul the defender , again , it 's two options .if he makes the basket as a two-point shot , count it , plus he gets the opportunity to make an extra point at the free throw line .or , he misses that shot and only gets two shots for the attempted , free , jump shot that he shot .okay .that 's the difference between fouling the jump shot shooter behind the three-point line and within the key .thank you .we just showed you how fouling a jump shot shooter behind a three point line and two-point line can change the game .
how do you determine if an instructor is qualified ?that 's kind of difficult .why ?the martial arts is an unlicensed profession .in other words , there are no specific universally recognized standards .anybody can buy a black belt and put it on .anybody can open a martial arts school .so there 's no barrier to entry which makes it a really good business if you are qualified .but it also opens the door for quackery and people who pass themselves off as being what they 're not .in order to access the qualifications of a good instructor you want to make sure , number one , top of the list , you want to know what you 're trying to accomplish .what is it , do you want to become a champion ?do you want to become a black belt ?do you want to become very proficient in self defense ?or do you just want the mental confidence that goes in to the martial arts ?once you know your goals , then its a matter of researching the instructors in your area .go watch the classes .and here 's what you 're looking for .you 're looking for an instructor that you think is going to motivate you .you 're looking for an instructor that going to keep you excited about coming back to class .initially with students , i like to help them set black belt as a goal .that takes about three years .so really think about it , three year span to earn your black belt .as we 're watching this instructor work we want to see how he or she works with the beginning students. [CLS] [SEP]and then we want to go watch the advanced classes .we want to see black belts .we want to see lots of brown and black belts who are proficient , they 're impressive .in other words , they have skills that you want .they have body condition .they have a mental attitude that really indicates they have been well trained over a two to three period to get to that advanced class .so as i 'm sitting there watching that class , kind of look at that as a time machine .if i 'm taking my child. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to go watch the advanced kids. [CLS] [SEP]and i want to see , o.k.in three years my kids going to be doing this .does this make sense ?is this what i want ?is this going to motivate him or her ?is this going to accomplish what they 're trying to accomplish ?so when you look at qualifications , i 'm not really looking at the past of the instructor .i 'm not interested in where he got his certificate .i 'm interested in the future with that instructor .the only situation that i 'm really looking for. [CLS] [SEP], first i want to make sure that they 're involved , with a continuing education professional program like the martial arts teachers association .that tells me this is someone who is continuing to learn , continuing to grow .but more importantly , i want to watch them in action .i want to make sure that they 're teaching in a way that 's going to motivate me , keep me coming to class , keep my child coming to class .then i want to watch those advanced students .and if they look sharp , they look strong. [CLS] [SEP], i know i 've got a good instructor .i hope that helps .i 'm john graden from johngraden.com .thank you .
now let me continue with the next segment of the shaolin continuous boxing .starting from the previous segment .one , two , kick , punch , walk down , step .okay .let me show it to you again .starting from here , your right hand goes , one , two , turn into bow stand , this hand is your hook , you perform this hand as a palm .now you 're going to bring this hand in , your left hand in .you 're going to bring your right hand over your head. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to kick with your left leg , kick , land , block up with your right hand , punch forward with your left hand .now you 're going to bring this hand down. [CLS] [SEP], right hand down , elbow along with this hand , step .and now , let me show it to you again .from here , one , two , three , kick , down , punch , block , step .and this concludes this segment .
o.k. [CLS] [SEP], this drill is what you do is called drop and hit .so i 'm going to have the kids drop and hit the ball .and i 'm going to work with one kid individually at a time to try to get them to learn how to groove the swing .so i 'm going to drop the ball for them .or they can drop for themselves and just going to try to hit it over the net .so it 's a pretty basic drill .so , maya hit these over the net .jasmine hit these over the net .and aidan , i 'm going to drop one for you .you 're ready ?o.k . [CLS] [SEP]aidan , here we go .take a big swing .that 's it aidan , that 's really good .so , maya go get another ball .aidan , you 're ready ?aidan , that 's unbelievably great .alright , aidan .here we go .you 're ready ?that 's pretty good .now if somebody was sitting in there , they might have to watch out down .right ?yeah ,so here we go .one more , aidan .you 're ready ?o.k. [CLS] [SEP], alright .so , aidan you stay there .you grab some tennis balls on your own now .and hit them .o.k. [CLS] [SEP]?so just go back down at that end .and jasmine , you and i are going to practice a little bit now .o.k. [CLS] [SEP]?so , i want to you to point the racket .racket back .and i want to take a nice big swing and hit the ball .good .here we go .alright , add one more .now move down aidan .o.k. [CLS] [SEP]?you got to always be careful .you do n't want to get hit by the kids .it 's happened before .o.k. [CLS] [SEP]?so now jasmine you work on your own .aidan come and grab a couple more balls .and maya , so let me drop a couple for you .that 's really good maya .so , maya step back here .and i 'll drop it for you .o.k. [CLS] [SEP]?ready ?good .good , and o.k .so , this is a drop and hit drill .so if you want the kids to little bit to learn how to do this .just hit the ball over the net .and when they can start doing that consistently .you 've obviously worked the back hands and then you can start having them hit with each other in addition to the wall and other drills .
so now i 'm going to some spouts , but before i start i 'm going to show you something important about spouts .if you look closely at this pot you can see that there 's a bulge that comes all the way down to here .that spout originally was thrown about this wide , and then cut at an angle .the reason for this is because the water or the tea in the pot needs to have a place to travel .if the spout only starts way up here , it 's not going to start pouring until it reaches that area , but if the spout starts way down here , it 'll start traveling through the spout early on in the pour .it makes for a much smoother pouring teapot .so now i 'm going to take this clay and center it again .but instead of leaving the floor for this , i 'm actually going to open all the way through to the head of the wheel , and i 'll pull this apart .you see i 'm going pretty wide , as i said that spout needs to start out pretty wide at the base , you can always cut it to make it smaller , but you ca n't make it bigger. [CLS] [SEP]once. [CLS] [SEP]you 've already done it , so go ahead and start with a nice , good , broad base .
but i did not. [CLS] [SEP]i went to the store and could not find any red laces. [CLS] [SEP]so i was going to do it solid black , but i ran out. [CLS] [SEP]so i used white. [CLS] [SEP]so it would look more .but you can i guess just pick the shoe lace that would n't best match the color and flow with your shoe so it would look the best .at the end you just stick the shoe laces down your shoe. [CLS] [SEP]sometimes the shoes would have a little pocket on the side where you just stick the shoe lace into if not you would just try to shove them down onto the side of the sole or set put your foot on top of them .
but anyway lettering on papers of different colors is really fun. [CLS] [SEP]and this is an acid-free paper , but the problem with colored papers is that sometimes they can tend to fade .so you kind of have to feel out that quality in the paper when you 're about to buy it .for everyday use , for things that i 'm not necessarily doing for other than maybe making a copy for reproduction i would use a sort of everyday paper like this which is acid-free paper. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's a card stock .so lots of different kinds of papers .the one thing that i want to show you that i think you 're going to be surprised by is that what i 'm going to recommend to you is that you , that you start out. [CLS] [SEP]your practicing with newsprint and newsprint is the kind of paper that you 've got to throw away because otherwise it 's going to disintegrate anyway , but with your newsprint you can practice long and hard .i 'm not talking about practicing mindlessly , but i 'm talking about practicing a lot .so let 's say you 're working on that very first stroke .so you see how the newsprint is giving me some sense of what i 'm doing in terms of verticality , in terms of size and so on .so this is a typical thing to practice , but i can , i must warn you that you have to pay attention to what you 're doing , even a little bit more than i 'm doing here because i 'm talking. [CLS] [SEP]and you should n't be talking when you 're doing this .here 's your basic stroke .now you can make a design out of that , and practice these guys .so newsprint turns out to be very useful .so now i just had that brush split on me because it got a little bit too dry , but look what it did .it showed us a center line .there are certain pens that you can split by the way .you can split those , these , these markers .you can split that with a razor. [CLS] [SEP]and then you have a white line in the center .that 's kind of cool .alright. [CLS] [SEP]so that 's it .that 's all i have to say about papers .
so the first thing you want to do when you open up the program is , go to , you have to create a new composition .so let 's go to composition , new composition where control. [CLS] [SEP]n.i 'm using a pc of course .and we come up with this menu ,composition settings .we 're going to take the ntscd1 setting with square pixels .but if you twiddle down and see the drop down menu , you 'll notice that we have a ton of different settings all the way up to the 4k film from web video 320 x 240.and you can create your own .i 've done that several times .you just click on custom and then set the parameters .and click on the little save icon here or you can create your own parameter for when you want to edit .so let 's go back to ntscd1 square pixel 720 x 540.square pixels frame rate you can adjust .here we 're going to go with 29.97 , full resolution .and you can set. [CLS] [SEP]your time code. [CLS] [SEP]anyway you want , here .so let 's click ok.and when that happens the composition comes up .
in this hair style variation , you can see that again it has a distinct look. [CLS] [SEP]but it is not going to take away from whatever you are drawing and with the sunglasses and up do. [CLS] [SEP]is always good .because you do not want to have to many competing features. [CLS] [SEP]and i said before if you will remember faces should be plain .they should be very plain , you do not have to have a lot of detail on them .few quick lines is really all that you need and this hairstyle , make the part in the middle and do your hair on the top , that is piled up first and then decide if she has had a hard a day , there is going to be a lot of hair flowing out or if it is supposed to be purposely styled like this .whatever you are trying to get across , whatever feeling , go with your gut instinct .if this shows it best do it if another strand will show it better do that .
i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]the member of calcutta racing pigeon club .now i will speak about the food that most of the fans here in calcutta , they give to the pigeons .they mostly give good quality , clean , hygienic food to the birds .they even buy the grains , pick up all of the bad grains and we feed only the quality grains and then the water , in fact most of the fancy they boil the water and give to the pigeons as to reduce the chance of getting disease .we feed mostly gram seeds which is highly hi-protein. [CLS] [SEP]and then we add some soy bean oil , corn , wheat and during the rainy seasons we feed them oil seed like linseeds and sarsouand sunflower seeds .also , a little bit of ground nuts to to help them to molt properly .then during the breeding season , we concentrate more on high protein seeds like grams and soybean and a lot of people avoid giving corn because that do cause a little bit of mouth disease cause canker .
we are actually ready to paint a flower .and i 'm going to start with a purple pansy .i will be adding a little bit of green around it , which will later become leaves , and then i 'll block in another pansy. [CLS] [SEP]and then the third .and then when we get those blocked in , i will start with adding a little background .so i 'm going to start with the pansy .so i 'm using what they actually call `` pansy purple '' .loading my brush .and if you remember , i said that you have to paint towards you , so when you add the paint keep brushing it towards you .i 'm adding a little more medium to make my paint go a little bit smoother .get it on a little darker .remember i want to get it darker in the center , so as i pull it towards me , draws that paint down .and i 'm doing the back petals. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm getting ready to do these .right now it just looks like a glob of paint but it will eventually get there .and because i have to keep painting towards me , i have to keep turning my blank .okay , we actually have the pansy in .
alright , so now i 'm on the other side , and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm just taking clay. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm moving it and pushing it and moving it into this piece here .making it all one .alright , just like that , and just like that , and that , and like that .give it those , the same curves that the pot has itself .if the handles are on the same page , the whole thing 's going to be working together. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's all going to be , and design wise. [CLS] [SEP]you want it all to be on the same page .otherwise this piece could look awkward or stupid , or boring , and you do n't want any of those things going on with your ceramics .you want it to be cool .there 's already enough awkward ceramics out there .there we go .so , now that those handles are melted into the pot , we can go just put a little design work in here .
duplicate whist .duplicate is the format that the american contract bridge league uses for all their games from the club level all the way up to the national and even the international level .in any card game ...any card game , i do n't care if it 's poker , i do n't care if it 's go fish. [CLS] [SEP], i do n't care if it 's uno .in any card game there is a luck factor .ok and occasionally luck will overcome skill although you ca n't count on luck you can count on skill and most people will win skillfully .the concept of duplicate and this is a manual system because we 're talking about live tournaments .this is a duplicate board .this is used in the bridge community however it suffices quite nicely for spades and for bid whist or whist or kiddie whist or what have you .ok , you 'll see that there 's a pocket that contains thirteen cards. [CLS] [SEP]so if i 'm sitting north this is my hand ok.and now when i bid this straight whist while i probably count on taking one trick here , two tricks here and one trick here .if it was my first turn to bid and let 's say that he 's the dealer , as my first turn to bid i would probably bid one downtown .i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]sorry we have a tremendous hand for downtown bidding. [CLS] [SEP]but we do n't have a lot .we only have 2 four card suites and this is certainly a liability , but the fact that we do have the opportunity to take a potential of eight tricks .
the next thing i am going to show you is called a step touch .you can do the step touch to the front to the side and to the back .we 're going to start in the front .make sure you 're in good posture .what you want to do is make sure your knees are bent .chest is lifted we 're going to bring one foot forward and touch .when you touch just put a little weight into it .step , touch put a little weight into it and your hips going to come forward .so again when you come forward step , touch .just put a little weight into it when you touch .step , touch .step , touch .step touch. [CLS] [SEP]this is step touch forward and to forward .forward , forward , forward , forward and next we 're going step touch the side .so just step touch and when we put our foot down. [CLS] [SEP]you just want to put a little pressure in to it. [CLS] [SEP]so step , touch , step , touch , step , touch , step , touch this is step touch to the side. [CLS] [SEP]and now we 're going to bring it back .back with the left leg. [CLS] [SEP]and we touch. [CLS] [SEP]we 're just going to put a little pressure into the foot and down .step back pressure into the foot and back and bring it back touch , touch , touch bring it forward touch , touch , touch , touch out to the side touch , touch , touch , touch and back .three , four , five , six , seven and eight step touch .
as you can see .right now they look black but they are plum and some white shears to put on there .so i 'm going to put the plum on the edges and this just shear them .just take my rod and insert it through .sometimes you might want to help it along at the end because of the hem .now since i have a metal brace here. [CLS] [SEP]i have 2 shears to put on. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm going to have 2 on one side of this half and 2 on this half. [CLS] [SEP]so the middle brace is in the middle .next i 'm going to put on a white shear .you see that it has pretty designs and this is also shear on and you might want to be careful because sometimes of the edges of your rod could be sharp and if you are working with lace you can snag it .
in this clip we are going to talk about the proper service procedure for removing and replacing a rear axle u joint on a ford explorer .in this step we are going to talk about lubricating of your replacement u joint .what i have here is the remnants of my ford equipment u joint .as you can see it , it 's junk , and one of the things that ?s missing on it is the grease fitting .this u joint is sealed and lubricated at the factory .there is no further maintenance you can do to this throughout the life of the vehicle .your after market replacement u joint is going to come with a grease fitting .now the u joint is already lubricated with some grease .however , what you ?re going to want to do is use your grease gun and fill it up until you see grease shooting out from the u joint seals .i 'm going to go ahead and pop that on right now and give it a couple shots .alright , we are going to go ahead and give it a couple pumps until we see grease coming out of the u joint seal area .at this point in time , it 's a good idea to inspect your front u joint to see if it has a fitting .greasing it right now would be a lot easier than after installing the drive shaft on the vehicle .this particular drive shaft has the factory fitting on it. [CLS] [SEP]and there is no grease port for it anywhere on here .if your drive shaft also has a slip joint in it , most four wheel drive front drive shafts have a slip joint. [CLS] [SEP], it 's a good idea to go ahead and take and lubricate that at this point in time .that is the proper way to lubricate your u joints and drive shaft assembly .
to get to the piano roll , you either click on the channel icon bringing up the plug-in , clicking on this button up here to get to the piano roll or you can right click on it and hit piano roll .this 'll bring you to the piano roll .here you have the arrayan notes and whatever you want to do to make the melody .all you have to do is put down a note , stretch it. [CLS] [SEP]to however long you want it to be to sustain it or shrink it to make staccato-type notes .this is the same 4/4 measure that you saw on the 3xosc window. [CLS] [SEP]only now it 's in a different format. [CLS] [SEP]so you get to tell how long it is .it also gives you a break every four to tell you when a section of measure is over or aligned if you were to think of it as sheet music .it 's pretty simple .the piano roll also has volume modification down here for when you want to make quieter notes .it 's really pretty intuitive .there are more complicated things you can do that we 'll discuss later .
this exercise is a side line leg exercise using the band to work the glutes and the back of the leg .take the band right in the middle and bring it over the toes , around the foot .put the band in one hand and come into your side line leg position ; everything is stacked , abs are engaged , head is in line with the spine , on the pillow created by your elbow .take the top leg and point the toe down , bring the foot about to the level of the heel of the front foot ; keeping things stacked , take a nice inhale up , exhale down ; inhale up , exhale down ; inhale and exhale .lets reverse , you can do this exercise as small as a softball .the most important thing- or as large as a basketball .the most important thing is that you maintain your stability and your posture .so , inhale and exhale , or inhale and exhale .you can also , keeping the foot back there , take a nice inhale and bring the leg up , exhale for , 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7 ,8 and inhale lower ; exhale , 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7 ,8 inhale lower .after you do pulses always do full range of motion , you 'll really feel this in the back of the legs .and last one , keeping the abs engaged , using this as the amount of tension that you want , and come down .
and i 'll demonstrate this .so that 's topspin , and what that 's going to do is you 're going to be able to hit the ball hard. [CLS] [SEP], it 's going to go a little high. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to spin. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to land back in .and when you watch the pros on tv , that 's their main forehand , is the topspin forehand .so we 're going to use this wall here to demonstrate how to hit the topspin forehand .so what you want to do , is you just want to drop the ball. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to spin it .see , i just brushed up on it , and i hit topspin .and you see if i have to move my feet , because if i do n't move , i wo n't be able to ...i get in proper position to hit the ball .now the other thing that you can do as a newer player , is you can use one of these nerf balls .one of the best things to do in tennis is to use a slower ball , because a brand new tennis ball can be quite bouncy .so if you use a nerf ball , it slows it down , and you can see the ball spinning , and you can develop through repetition , a pretty consistent confident stroke .
so , we 've got the iceman from the homegrown band out there right now with my little puppy bongo , and me and the lovely e are going to go out and join them , and we 're going to go for a nice , long paddle .paddling , you 're actually going to be working out pretty central muscle mass , you 're going to be working out your biceps , shoulders , arms , pretty much everything in here , but a lot of core .if you 're going for long distance paddles , the biggest thing you 're going to be working with is core right here .i mean sometimes it 's a little tighter than other times. [CLS] [SEP]but , i 'm going to keep the shirt on just to not embarrass anybody .let 's do it .when you 're putting the board in the water , it 's always good to put the front part in first .do n't ever let the skag or the fin on the back of the board really fall hard into the sand , it can loosen it in its fin box and eventually get destroyed .you get ready to put it in , you 're just going to drop it nice and easy off your head , let the front of the board in , and then set down the very back part right there in the skim to get your final set .
when you receive your trays back in about 3 weeks , you will also be given about a 2 week , 14 day supply of the whitening syringes that go in the trays that you are to fill them with .what you 'll do with these is you 'll be careful to not overly insert too much of the material ,the whitening gel , and the reason for that is because you use almost a half of a syringe for each whitening period that you do .so a quarter of a syringe for an upper , a quarter of a syringe for a lower , and the reason why you want to be careful not to put too much gel is because once this gel goes into the tray and into your mouth , once it becomes the temperature of your mouth it will tend to liquefy more. [CLS] [SEP]so it will flow easier .what happens is people who tend to over fill their trays. [CLS] [SEP]will often find that they have much salivation happening , part of that gel is escaping and coming out and they 're uncomfortable at that point , and most of the time you 'll need to either dab with a paper towel or even expectorate .so what we 'll do , what i 'd like to talk about. [CLS] [SEP]is that we use that point. [CLS] [SEP]and you always want to fill by just putting either one single dab in all of the outside areas of the teeth .one single dot worth .it 's only the outsides of the teeth that people will be able to see .there really is no reason to whiten on the insides of teeth .that would be using more product than necessary .so you 'll put all of those dabs. [CLS] [SEP]and then you can go back and with the tip , you can just kind of scribble at that dab and. [CLS] [SEP]what that 's going to do is cover the full surface area of the tooth and teeth that are being whitened .the wonderful thing about this form of whitening is that it can also be very sight specific , pretty similar to makeup and cosmetics again .with this way , if you find that in your arch , your corner teeth , happen to be more yellow than others and that 's very common area , you eventually can just go and fill those corner teeth to get the proper whitening , so that all teeth will respond at the same time as others and so that you can just be very specific in where you want to whiten .also too , people if they have cosmetically treated teeth such as crowns , maybe the front area is crowns or bonded teeth , you would be able to skip using product in that area and again target those teeth that you are specifically looking to have whitened .
the consistency of that is a larger grand firework which normally you will not see unless it 's in a firework display such as the white house or the washington memorial displays they have in washington dc or the bigger cities .the class b fireworks what you see usually in your local community shot off at ballparks and at different events , you can get those at larger suppliers but you must have a special class b license to shoot those and also to purchase those .you must also be professionally trained to do that and to have those through the american power techniques association to be certified through that and to be able to cover those areas to shoot a ball , anything 2 and a quarter inches up to a 12 inch ball .okay , if you were looking at shooting class b fireworks or purchasing them , you will have to go through a mandated fbi background check to get those .and usually that consist of atf also .you have to go through an extensive check out to check your background , the same thing that you do when getting a gun permit .but it 's a little bit more involved , you would also have to go through regulations of where you carry your fireworks , where they 're stored at , and of course you know a federal government needs to know that at all times .if you shop for fireworks or if you 're still housing them and of course what you use so. [CLS] [SEP]that way you ca n't just give them to friends and neighbors. [CLS] [SEP]but you have to be certified to be able to do that .also the class c fireworks , which most of you are normally familiar with ; are what we shoot in our backyards. [CLS] [SEP]and they consist of the fireworks that you see right here that we have behind. [CLS] [SEP]and they are common fireworks meaning that they are usually somewhere around the 1.4 ground level which is a standard throughout the states for fireworks .i think it covers most of the states with that ; you will have to check with your state to find out the laws and regulations restricting these fireworks .
hi , my name 's chance platt from humphries archery here in american fork , utah .today we 're talking to you about bow hunting basics .what you need , really , to bow hunt is one : a bow , arrow , broad heads .your stipulations on bows and arrows and that sort of thing , again , change from state to state .so you want to make sure you check your ... [CLS] [SEP].with. [CLS] [SEP]your local division of wildlife resources .make sure that you are in compliance with all that .the biggest thing is ... [CLS] [SEP].that. [CLS] [SEP]most people do n't realize is bow hunting really starts on the range .a good rule of thumb i always like to use is , until you can shoot ten out of ten arrows at ... [CLS] [SEP].at. [CLS] [SEP]a target and get it within a six inch circle , then you really do n't have any business shooting at an animal at that range .and so that 's kind of been my guiding principle .until you can do that at fifty yards , you should n't be shooting at fifty yards .if you can do it at twenty yards , but you ca n't do it at thirty , then that basically says that you need to be within about twenty yards of whatever your target is in order to shoot , and actually pull an ethical shot , in my view .ethics are something that 's open to debate , though , so .okay ,so depending on ....depending. [CLS] [SEP]on different laws and rules and what types of animal that you 're hunting , you 'll use different things .i generally like to use a compound bow .i like to take advantage of the newer technology and newer speed , and , lethality that the archery business has been able to produce .a lot of people are more in traditional , and they 're more into the authentic nature of it , which is great .they 'll shoot a re-curve , or something of that nature .for instance , this would be an arrow with a broad head on it .this is a fixed blade .some states only allow fixed blades .utah , as of right now , they 'll allow fixed blades and mechanical blades .but they have to be of a certain diameter .so , when you 're out hunting , the biggest thing is to be sure of what you 're shooting at .be sure of your game .and probably to get a real good ....real. [CLS] [SEP]good hold ahead of time on where you need to shoot the animal in order to pull off a lethal shot .part ....part of the point of hunting. [CLS] [SEP]is really. [CLS] [SEP], i 've always said it 's not so much about killing something , but if you 're going to go about killing something , you should probably do it in the most lethal way possible so that they 're not going to suffer any undue suffering than they need to .so you should ....the. [CLS] [SEP]last thing in the world you want to do is wound an animal and have it get away , and just to go and have problems down the road .number one thing is make sure you can be ethical in all that you 're doing .
and we would repeat that pattern to the end of the loaf .here we go one , two , over two , we would lift up the one. [CLS] [SEP]and then we would go over the last two .set that aside you can rearrange the dough whatever makes it more comfortable. [CLS] [SEP]okay. [CLS] [SEP]here is our two over the two , lift up the one , and go over the two .when you go over the two i like to pull in the other two. [CLS] [SEP]and you would just keep pulling it in .here we go again over two , lift up the one , and over two , over two lift up the one and over two .when i go over the last two i pull back the last one .we go over two , under one , over two , and even with the small piece we are going to continue the same pattern over two , under one , over two , and just keep doing it even to the last bit .over two , under one , and over two .when you get to the end you just pinch those together , tuck it under. [CLS] [SEP], you can shape your loaf a little bit like that , tuck under the starting ones , shape it up a little .we are going to place that on our sheet pan covered with a little baking paper and we would be letting that rise for 30 minutes. [CLS] [SEP]and we would cover that up with plastic in the recycle plastic that i use for the dough and that is just good enough for that .
hi , i 'm emily larew continuing on with our hip hop series .we 're on the sixth count of eight , counts five , six , seven and eight , and we have a jump and run .so , we just finished our shoulder shake on eight .we 've got , and this is on four. [CLS] [SEP], we step left five , we 're going to throw our arms straight up like snap , all right .so make sure you bend them and snap them straight up to the sky , and we 're going to bring our right foot in and jump together , all right .but we 're going to turn towards the back .so , we 're here on four , we step five , go straight up , go over your right shoulder , six , from there we 're going to step with our right foot , right , cross in front ,right .and you look towards the right as well , as you throw your hands down on eight .okay , try that again .so you go three and four , we step five , six ,we run seven and eight .good .and do n't be afraid to travel , all right .really travel , because that makes you look bigger , instead of keeping everything really , really small inside your box .one more time .three and four , five , six , seven , and eight .awesome .those were your runs with your pops and your jumps .
another variation of the cartwheel is a round off .now the round off is very similar to the cartwheel except for we have a torso turn and instead of our legs hitting the floor one by one , our legs will hit the floor together .now , when starting a cartwheel , the best way to learn is by taping a line of masking tape across the floor that you 're going to be using .once you have that masking tape set , you can put your toe on the line to start .now the first thing that 's going to hit the floor is going to be your first hand .now if you 're right handed that 's going to be your right hand .if you 're left handed you simply take the other end of the line. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to go with your left hand .it is important to know how to do both sides because you may be asked to come from different directions .so , once we have set ourselves , we 're going to raise our right hand or left hand. [CLS] [SEP], whichever is going to be your first to hit the floor , you 're going to make sure it lands on the tape - one hand , two hand , foot , foot .and that 's basically what you 're going to want to do for the cartwheel .now once you get your basic mastered , you 're going to want to speed it up a little bit so you can get some momentum building .now the round off is very similar to the cartwheel .you 're definitely going to start with the same preparation. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to be the same middle form .the only thing is once we 're in the air. [CLS] [SEP]and we have both feet up. [CLS] [SEP]we 're going to want to meet them together and drop them together so they 're touching when you hit the ground .now the round off is probably the most important tumble in cheerleading because this is how we 're going to start all of our running tumbling passages .now , it 's really important to practice your round off with speed and power and height .so usually you want to get as much of a running start as possible .you really want to go as fast as you can into that tumble , get a lot of power going and really snap out of it and from here , at the end of our round off is where we 're going to do all of our back flips , back handsprings and fulls .
swans on roller with a single twist .again if you just found me and you have n't seen the previews on the series you might want to check out the proper technique to do a swan on the roller and some tips on how to get a good roller that does n't warp on you .we are going to lay down on our stomach , our heels are going to be together and toes apart. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to squeeze the leg together .now as i position my arms on the roller i 'm going to get the middle of my forearm on there , shoulder width apart with the palms facing each other .as i go into a full gliding , not gliding but the swan , i 'm going to be lifting , now once i am here the twist is going to be letting go of one hand .so you see that you may want to master the swans before you add the challenge. [CLS] [SEP]and you are taking your head with it .the idea is not to let the elbows bend , so you do n't want to do this because then your body will collapse and i 'll do one more and down. [CLS] [SEP]and there you go a swan with a twist , very challenging .so start with the swans and get your back strong enough before you add the challenge and. [CLS] [SEP]you 'll be stronger. [CLS] [SEP], i promise you , you 'll be tired after this too ,bye bye .
this upper body tubing exercise is the triceps overhead extension version number one .grab your tubing and you should be about light to medium resistance .and you 're going to take one hand and place it inside the handle , flip your hand over and grab a little bit of the tubing with the handle .and then i 'm going to turn around and show you that behind you you 're going to grab the tubing .now you have small tubing between your hands the more resistance , the more tubing you have the less resistance .so you can crank up and adjust that .so you are going to have your arms in place and just extend up and lower down .now try to keep the elbow as close to head as possible .if you have shoulder issues then take this hand down alongside your hips so that you ?re not pulling your shoulder out of place .so you want to extend up and lower down .so you 're really isolating that tricep area .exhale as you lift up , inhale as you lower down .now just perform this exercise until you fatigue out that tricep and then switch to the other side .and that is your tricep overhead extension version number one .
latch became a standard in vehicles as of 2003 if you look over here you would notice that we have a metal bar here that is knowns as a latch anchor a lower tethered anchor .lower latch anchor .it is important when you use the latch anchor that you check your vehicle manufacturers instructions. [CLS] [SEP]these are placed in exactly 280 millimeters and designed to be used in specific locations .one of the most common errors we see is using the wrong latch anchor to put the restraint perhaps in the center section but using the outside latches that wo n't work properly .if you decide that you are going to use a latch the new seats all come with a latch then it is okay to use the latch make sure you but do n't use both latch and vehicle safety belts. [CLS] [SEP]it is not designed for that you have with the ride down use one or the other. [CLS] [SEP]both are equally safe .in this situation if i 'm using latch to install this. [CLS] [SEP]it is important to look at the latch itself this latch is directional. [CLS] [SEP]you could see that there is little arrows right here that says this needs to be up .some of the other latches are actually steel clips .like the one on this base these are steel clipped latches they have a heavy side and light spring side .when you use this latch the heavy steel sides needs to face up like this if you put it in upside down and hook it this way you could pull against the spring the thin spring side. [CLS] [SEP]and it could fail. [CLS] [SEP]so make sure you use the heavy side up .in this case to install the latch what you would do is place the seat in position , push the latch on the left anchor like that you would hear it click .you want to make sure that the straps are not twisted. [CLS] [SEP]you are going to push it on and hear it click .this one has a single point in which you pull to tighten it and you want to get your weight into the sit and pull it tight here and then check your installation at the belt path no more then a inch movement .and you got a well installed seat .
today we 're going to talk about how to diagnose an ailment of your fish .part of keeping a fish is making sure that we visually inspect them everyday .when we feed them we want to make sure that they have a good appetite and that their fins are not torn , they 're not in rough shape , they 're not sitting at the bottom .once you 've been keeping your fish for a while , you 're going to know if they 're acting different .a common problem with fish is ick which is tiny white spots over the entire fish itself .a lot of ailments are caused by stress which can be water quality , temperature and fish stressing out other fish themselves .one thing that i like to start with if there is a regular ailment going on is using a natural product .we have melafix and pemefix .melafix is an anti-bacterial and pemefix is an anti-fungal .what i like to do is use both of them together because its not an exact science of exactly what 's going on with the fish so if there is a bacterial problem , we can take care of fungus as well if that happens to be part of the issue as well .simply follow directions and it tells you exactly how much to use , when you should do a water change .another thing that you can put in your tank is aquarium salt .aquarium salt raises the electrolytes in the tank and it also helps reduce stress .my name is michael and today we 're talking about how to diagnose an ailment .
with this tricep exercise with the cable pulley system , we 're going to use this rope .so we 're going to have control over our prime mechanics and our active range of motion .straight bar is really going to dictate your mechanics .so , with this we can really kind of arc like ,kind of like you would with a bowflex .and that 's what the cable pulley system emulates .so with the elbows in by the side , we do n't start the movement from up here .this is one of the biggest mistakes i 'll see when i 'm in a facility , is people will start their tricep movement from here .and as you could see , i 'm not even using triceps .so if i bring them right down here beside my side , that is the point of initiation of the movement .and then i 'm going to contract with that three-headed muscle on the back of the arm and release right back to neutral where my wrists , elbows and shoulders are in line .again , feet hip width apart. [CLS] [SEP]and we want a slight bend in the knees , and just with the back of the arm , elbows and shoulders stabilize , and release back to neutral .and contract and release .never letting that shoulder come forward or back past the mid-line of the body .working ten to fifteen reps , one to three sets to fatigue .
a variation of the separation between the activities and the hands .you have already the circle and we did this movement , so now we try to do a circle like that. [CLS] [SEP]and this is also a real separation because one of our hand is doing always a circle and the other hand is doing always doing this go .i can stop it. [CLS] [SEP]and i can just continue with the two ball in one hand. [CLS] [SEP]and then i try to do the circle again .at the beginning probably you can not do a nice circle , but with the practice , you can go and you can really arrive , arrive to do a nice and a big circle .as big the circle , like you can have a circle like that as well , but as big the circle. [CLS] [SEP]i think , as nice to trick this .but you can decide how you want to do your circle .it 's the same with the left hand , so we will do the two ball in one hand and. [CLS] [SEP]at the same time , we do a circle with the right hand .i can stop it. [CLS] [SEP]and i can go back to the two ball in one hand. [CLS] [SEP]and i can go back again doing the circle .probably at the beginning , you will face the difficulty that your hand were going something like that because your right hand also want to follow your left hand .but this is the separation is about , that i do another thing with my right hand than with with the left hand .
your safety is paramount in moving , so you want to do some things to make sure that your move is as safe as possible .and obviously there 's a lot of lifting and up and down and going up and down stairs in the process of moving , so to make sure that you and all of your friends and family are as safe as possible. [CLS] [SEP], you want to be cognizant of how you 're packing your boxes .put heavy items in their own box or some items do n't even need a box , and put lighter objects in the larger boxes that you have , so the point being that you wo n't have boxes that are too heavy .so i like to kind of think about the maximum amount of weight that you or an average person would be able to carry and try to keep your boxes below that .so that means not packing all your books in one box , i think that bank boxes are really great boxes for moving books .most people can pick up a bank box full of books .also you do n't want to move flammable items , so just go ahead and recycle paint and ammunition and gasoline , any of those things that you have at your house .you want to find another home for them so that you 're not moving them from one place or another , especially , particularly if it 's a hot day or a dry day that you 're going to be moving .so find the places in your town where you can recycle those , or find a friend who will use them or needs them and give those items away .
so now that we know how a band fits , we 're going to talk about how the straps should fit .in the store i work in everyday , women come in complaining about the straps hurting them .they cut into them because they pull them too tight because the bra does n't fit , or they put on a bra. [CLS] [SEP]and there 's a little bit of gapping right here. [CLS] [SEP]so they immediately take it off and say it does n't fit .well , here 's a few purposes of the strap .again , the support comes from your band , not the straps , so you should n't be tightening the strap in order to get more support out of your bra .the strap should be about two fingers worth of tension , and when it 's gapping in the front , the strap can be how you pull that tighter .so sometimes it 's just a matter of pulling this up a little bit , and tightening the strap to get a smoother shape on top .what you can do with this bra is , all of the straps unhook ,so we can unhook this strap , loosen the strap all the way , and make it a halter .and when you do that , you can actually pull the back down lower , so that this is great for a low back halter top or dress .additionally , you can unhook this again , and you can cross the straps .and there you go !
so starting with your hands right here in the middle of the forehead go ahead and glide down the sides of the face to the cheeks so go ahead and target the cheeks .stroke in a big circle , big circle , walking around a little bit and making sure that you are getting that entire area .sometimes when you are experiencing an earache you can actually feel it in the eustachian tube that is causing the earache and you might actually feel it in the front of the face .not only in the back or in your ear you might feel it in your cheeks. [CLS] [SEP]so let 's go ahead and massage the cheeks just in case there is any discomfort there. [CLS] [SEP]we can go ahead and help to alleviate some of that .so we 're just massaging in circles , great big circles on the cheeks .do that a few times .you can do it slower or do it a little bit faster .you can adjust the speed or a little bit of the pressure .you want to use gentle but firm pressure so we are using a little bit of pressure with this stroke but just go ahead and make a little bit of a bigger circle. [CLS] [SEP]and as you start to complete that stroke circle all the way up again touching the sides of the face and up to the forehead and rest your hands right in the center before you move on to the next stroke .
now we 'll go over the size of your home and how you might describe your home .small , a small house ; medium-sized , or average-sized , large or a mansion , a large house .you notice that my facial expression differs between the various sizes .you might base the size on how many rooms the house has .a small house might have one bedroom or two bedrooms .you might have two bedrooms and one bathroom ; three bedrooms , two bathrooms ; room , bathroom , small , medium , large -- practice those signs .good job .
in this segment , we 're going to be talking about orientation of the mountain , getting to the mountain if you do n't know your way around right away , just take a few minutes to look around .if you ?re just a beginner. [CLS] [SEP], you want to be sure to stay to the areas where the pitch of the mountain is a lot less .that way you wo n't be in over your head or pick up too much speed without wanting to .if your more of an advanced snowboarder , your comfortable with your carves and turning down the mountain , feel free to explore .there 's more challenging lifts that access steeper pitch areas .the runs go from green as the easiest to blue , black , and double black diamond being the hardest .don ?t be intimidated by the signs or what it says it is .trust yourself and go for it .
okay , we 're going to start on this house landscape right now , and what we 're going to need is a brush , a round brush , between a number 6 and a number 14.this is a number 10 right here .and you 'll need a brush for detail , which could be like a lizard lick , a number 8 lizard lick , or a number 1 rigger .you 'll need paper towels ; one to wipe off your colors , and one to clean your brush , and you 'll need a water container ; hopefully clear , one that wo n't tip over , and you 're going to need some paints .these are dried , tube-type paints , and you 're going to need yellow ocher , cobalt blue , payne 's gray , permanent rose , yellow , and. [CLS] [SEP]you 'll probably need some burnt sienna in there , as well .you 'll also need a .5 millimeter pencil to do your tracing , and you can just print off something from a copying machine , or you can trace over some tracing paper that has an outline in it .this is a transfer paper ; it 's graphite , and it 's erasable .it 's not like the transfer papers that are carbon papers that were used to be set up for typing .
listen , bold , sexy bangs. [CLS] [SEP]are the hottest thing this side today , and i want you to learn how to get them .now remember , we never want to cut our bangs too short .because if we cut them too short , it takes too long to grow them out .grab some magazines , look through books , and find the bold and sexy bang that 'll work for you .remember , never cut above the fingers when pulling that hair down , always cut underneath .underneath is going to leave you that extra length , that you would n't ordinarily get by cutting on top .last , but not least , if you have to , check with your local stylist .i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]sure she 's a pro at giving nice bangs .hey , bangs are everywhere , in the magazines , on the runway .why do n't you get your own sexy. [CLS] [SEP], bold bangs ?my name is sylvia russell , and this is how you can cut your own bold and sexy bangs .
once your comfortable jumping the bounce , you can on another element .we 're going to add on a one stride .to do this we 're going to walk eighteen feet .that 's going to be six steps , one , two , three , four , five , six and draw a line in the dirt .then we 'll place our pole and standards .once again you 'll want a ground line. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll use a flower box , directly underneath the vertical. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're ready to jump .
i 'm a certified master mechanic out of reading , pennsylvania .today , we 're going to talk about , how to know if you 've got a faulty thermostat in your car .the easiest way to tell , the thermostat will give you two different problems .either one , your car is going to run too hot and overheat , and two , it will run too cold , and you get no heat .now , a thermostat sticks closed , you 're not going to get any flow going through the motor .it 's going to overheat on you .the second thing it 's going to do , it 's going to stick open , and you 're actually getting no heat , because it 's going to constantly circle , and not build any heat inside the engine .the way to tell whether or not you have a faulty thermostat , you have an upper and lower radiator hose .after the engine warms up , about 195 degrees ,you obviously either , if it 's stuck open , do n't do this if it 's stuck closed , but if it 's stuck open , and you 're getting no heat. [CLS] [SEP], here 's a good way to tell if you 've got a bad thermostat .place one hand , with the engine not running , on the top radiator hose .the other hand , if you can reach it , you might have to get up underneath it .put your hand on the lower radiator hose .they should be about the same temperature .if they 're not , obviously. [CLS] [SEP], you 've got yourself either a low radiator , or stuck thermostat , but they should be about the same temperature , when this thing gets up to about 195 degrees .just check your two hoses .if the bottom hose is a lot cooler , it 's usually stuck .it 's real simple .it 's not a hard thing to diagnose .here 's a thermostat .it 's spring activated .as it heats up , it opens .as it cools down , it will close .
and i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]teaching you proper care of fish today and a little bit about the different types of fish .now we 're going to talk about the second process of cycling your tank out which is called the nitrite cycle .the ammonia is going to be the first part of the cycle .the second part is going to be the nitrite .in about week three to four as the ammonia levels are coming back down. [CLS] [SEP], the nitrite level is going to go up .the nitrite level will go all the way up , peak out and drop back down .usually , it takes about six weeks for this process .sometimes it can take a little longer and take eight weeks .what i 'm going to demonstrate to you now is how to do a nitrite test .as we did with the ammonia test , we 're going to get our test vial that has the same little white line on it .we 're going to take water out of the tank and put into the tube just like we did on the ammonia test .you can tell that we filled the bottle to the white line with the water .we 'll set this down and we 'll get the nitrite test box which is pink .on it , it has `` add five drops . [CLS] [SEP]''what we 'll do is we 're going to remove the cap off the bottle , add five drops , put the top back on and shake the vial toward the color .this test process takes five minutes , but right now it 's showing a nice pretty blue color .if this goes from a nice pretty blue color to a purple color , then we have high nitrites in the tank , which is also bad for the fish as well as the ammonia process .nitrite levels can also be caused from too much fish food and too many fish in the tank as well as ammonia .if you have ammonia and nitrite in a tank both at the same time , then you need to do some major surgery on your tank to take care of the problem and find out what the problem is .'cause if you do n't , unfortunately , you can lose your whole tank .so , if you have a fish tank , monitor your ammonia and your nitrite at least once a week , if not once every two weeks just to keep check on everything to make sure everybody 's happy and. [CLS] [SEP]okay .
now the first thing you 're going to need is you 're going to need to type of paint that you 're going to use .typically what you want to use is a semi-gloss or a gloss paint .it shines a lot more and it 's a lot easier to clean .you 're also going to need some painter 's caulk -- it 's got to be paintable caulk --some 3m blue tape ( either a two or three inch roll ) , an angled brush , a caulk gun , sandpaper , may need a scraper , a five-in-one or a putty knife , and then you 'll need some spackling putty .okay , first thing you 're going to do is you 're going to want to prepare your window casings .so if you have any nail holes or any type of gouges in the casing , what you 're going to want to do. [CLS] [SEP]is you 're going to want to get your spackling with a putty knife , scoop some out and smear it over that hole --like , try to smear it as smooth as you possibly can , that way you do n't have to sand quite as much .then what you 're going to have to do is you 're going to have to come over here. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to have to cut open your caulk. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to have to run a bead of caulk along the inside and along the outside of the trim , and wipe it smooth with your finger after you caulk it .once your casing is all prepped , then you can open up your paint and get your paintbrush ready .but first , you need to tape off any areas that you do n't want to get paint on , like the inside where the window is , and the outside where the wall is .you want to tape both of those off with the blue tape .then you get your paintbrush and you can dip it in the paint and brush it off on the side of the bucket , and then you want to make long , even strokes , up and down your casing .and you want it to go on pretty thick. [CLS] [SEP]but you do n't want it to run .my name 's ryan parker with parker home renovations .you can contact me at www.parkerhomerenovations.com .
so i can cut it down to size .first we are going to rip it to 21 13/16 .then we use a table saw and rip to 9 inches .then we are going to make some trim out a piece of scrap oak .then i 'm going to size it down by using a planer .then i cut the length , then we glue it , clamp it , and pin nail it .
and we 're going to talk about the work surface that you will be working on .you can work on the kitchen table or a card table like i am .you need to make sure that you cover it with a piece of cloth , a towel , something to protect the work surface that you 're working on , especially if you 're using the glue .you also might want to wear something to protect your clothing from getting the glue on , just in case you accidentally get to close to it. [CLS] [SEP]or you spill it .you do n't want to ruin your clothes .so you want to wear a protective apron or something over you and put something on the table .this glue will ruin the varnish on your table and it will come off of a card table .so you want to make sure that you put something over it , and do n't use newspaper .the print will come up on your.. [CLS] [SEP]on the project that you 're working on .if it 's newsprint that does n't have the printing on it , just regular paper that 's fine .do n't use newspaper that has printing on it .the ink will come up on all of the things that you 're working on .
okay , the last emotion that i 'm going to teach is anxious .anxious or nervous .anxious .right now , i 'm anxious .nervous , nervous .nervous , you might show it as sweat coming down your face , nervous .scared , scared .frightened , frightened .let 's review .anxious , depending on how you 're feeling you 'll want to incorporate your facial expression .nervous , nervous .scared , frightened .we 're done , good job .
in this clip we 're going to talk about hand tracing stencils on thermograph paper and the tools that are required to properly do this .thermograph paper comes in sheets like this , eight and a half by eleven , or eight and a half by fourteen inches .and it 's a little bit pricey .so once you get your artwork , you want to cut it with some scissors and make it flow .in this particular case. [CLS] [SEP]i 've got some artwork from our new client johnny .which he wants the letters `` faith '' , that you can see here .and he went on the internet and he chose a font that he liked. [CLS] [SEP]and i rearranged them vertically because of the position he wants them on his arm .so i 've got the `` faith '' here. [CLS] [SEP]that 's vertically , i 've got my cut piece of thermograph paper .and scissors , a mechanical pencil , and a nice sharp ball point pen is what 's required to hand trace this .so at this point we 're going to move on to the next step .
what we 're going to demonstrate , talk about is the proper way to make a tensionless hitch around an object for securing the end of a rope .the purpose of the tensionless hitch is to not put a great deal of strain on the rope itself .and , we basically take the rope. [CLS] [SEP]form it into a bite and tie what 's called the figure of eight on a bite .the figure of eight on a bite forms a loop at the end .we then attach something like a d-ring or a carabiner to the end of that rope and pass it around whatever object we want to secure it to , two to three times .it could be a pole .it could be a pipe .it could be a tree or anything along those lines .once it 's been passed along several times around the object , we then clip that d-ring or carabiner and tighten up the rope until what we have is called a tensionless hitch .tensionless hitch is a great way to attach the rope to an object without putting unnecessary due strain on the rope .
one of the reasons i use a slide to paint from .it sounds a little odd. [CLS] [SEP]but if you look at a slide or a transparency obviously by the name it is transparent and. [CLS] [SEP]what happens when you drop this into your slide viewer or simply hold it up to a light is when a light comes through the slide you can truly see the colors of whatever the image is whereas if you print a piece on paper and you look at a photograph on paper the colors are not as vibrant .so if you ca n't see the vibrant colors sometimes it is difficult to duplicate them. [CLS] [SEP]so one of the ways you can get really vibrant , pure clean colors on your water colors is to see them in the first place and one of the ways that i do that is to actually view a slide so that i can see the colors as they actually come through and that makes it a lot easier for me to duplicate those colors and it just really does lend a lot to the piece. [CLS] [SEP]and it sounds kind of common sense. [CLS] [SEP]but if you ca n't see it you ca n't duplicate it .so remember to try and use a transparency just to get some of the hints of the color. [CLS] [SEP]and it should be really effective for you .
our newest addition is chipotle chip , which is made with the same process , but you put smoked chipotle peppers in the process , in the dough , before it gets sheeted , that 's the process .you can see it 's very distinct in color , and the key to that smoke-y flavor comes out , but the chipotle pepper has an aftertaste .you taste the chip , a second later , the chipotle pepper comes in .very distinct flavor , very different , and chipotle is very popular .chipotle is a smoked pepper that has different smoke-y aroma .it 's a deep flavor , and it 's very distinct .so , chipotle pepper is actually the jalape ?o pepper , for those that did n't know that .so , put in the vinegar and spices and gives it a very smoke-y flavor , and very distinct from jalape ?o , or other peppers .that actually goes into the process of making our chipotle .the actual pepper is put right into the dough before it gets baked to make a tortilla for our chip .you can tell from the color , the rich and the smokiness is going to come out .
all right , now , we have all the seasonings in. [CLS] [SEP]but before they get a chance to burn , you go ahead and add a half a cup of white wine , and a little less than a fourth a cup of white wine vinegar .now , while we 're waiting for that to reduce , we 're going to get our bowl , and our strainer , and one lemon .we 're going to put the strainer right over the bowl , going to cut this lemon in half .and then we 're going to go ahead and squeeze right over the top .and the reason why we do this instead of doing it straight into our saute pan is that you can see there are seeds here , and so we do n't want anyone to choke on the seeds when they 're eating this dish .and we do n't want to have to be sticking our fingers in to pull them out .after we 've juiced the lemon , we 'll add it to our shrimp .
so i 'm going to come over and turn on my steamer .and , it takes , usually just a few minutes to warm up , and as that 's warming up , i 'm going to get our next product which is our enzyme .and the enzyme is an exfoliant .very mild and gentle .it 's not granule or abrasive at all .it actually acts as , like , a tiny pac-man on the skin 's surface , and it eats away at the dead surface skin .really leaving the skin super soft and hydrated , and clear of any congestion .and with the combination of an enzyme and the steam , it just gives you really outstanding phenomenal results .and , this also helps prepare the skin for extractions .and , extractions is when we clean the skin out of , you know , congested pores , whether it be dirt and oil , or blackheads , or whiteheads , but this is going to help prepare that skin for that step .so that we 're not forcing anything out of the skin that 's leaving damage or scarring to the skin .so you just spread around the enzyme like so. [CLS] [SEP], you do n't have to rub it in , you just kind of spread it around on the surface .and make sure that steam is hitting her directly right on her face here .jen , are you feeling the steam pretty good ?ok.and so this is , we 're going to allow her to steam for about ten minutes. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's really going to allow her pores to open up and to really embrace the enzyme so that her skin gets the maximum benefits of this treatment .
now this is what i like to call the one , six , five bounce .it 's not just your standard back and forth .it has a little bit more of a rock to it .the same way i had you rocking your fingers before .so here 's what you do .you go to find whatever key that you 're going to be in , e-flat .that 's where i 'm going to give you an example today .we 're going to go one , six , five .so , find the one , which is e-flat , the six which is c , the five which is going to be b-flat .so it 's one , six , five , six , one , six , five , six , one , six , five .so that 's what i 'm going to be doing with my foot .i 'm sorry. [CLS] [SEP], i kicked down the volume .up do it again .so as you 've seen what i 've done with my left foot .i 'm just going to place my foot , my right foot back there to control the volume .so that 's what i 'm doing down below there .it 's using the one , six , five .and it depend ,you know the placement would also depend on the key that you 're in .let 's say if i were in , in an a-flat , it 's a little bit easier because on the foot pedal down below , it 's more relative , right next to each other .so it would sound like , a lot less movement .so .
see the word here you can put the occupation .so doctor is isha in japanese .student is gakusei .so if you 're a student you would say : watashi wa gakusei desu .that 's correct .and what else ?let 's say you are -- you work for a company .watashi wa kaisha desu .it 's very popular in japan , of course .and you would --you are --let 's say you 're an actor going to japan. [CLS] [SEP], you say : watashi wa haiyuu desu .and model is moderu , and businessman is businessman .so some words you can just pronounce it as in japanese .some words you need to translate -- a translation .but you can use this sentence to describe your occupation .so what is your occupation ?do you think of a word ?let 's put in this sentence .watashi wa - desu .that 's good .
okay , now we 're changing the drill .now , were ; you 're at a point where you 're able to control your serve a little bit .so , in the opposite service boxes , we 've put a couple of targets and that gives you something to focus on .so , serving at targets is a very useful drill .now , you can set them anywhere. [CLS] [SEP]you want so you can work on your up to middle serve ,your out wide serve and your various serves .so , gary is going to try and hit this target and so just hit a lot of spin , gary .wow , almost got it on his first try .good and then gary come to this side .so now gary 's going to go serve to ; upon his backhand at the other target .that 's pretty good , gary .okay , so having a target focuses you .so , if you do n't have anybody to practice with , where you 're able to serve them your forehand or backhand ; set up some targets , bring your basket of balls out to the park and see how many times you can hit a target .
on your cell phone it 's pretty easy to do if your out , you leave your cell phone home , and you are missing those calls , missing those voicemail messages , dial your cell phone number after your voice message comes on hit pound. [CLS] [SEP], you generally enter your password and you 'll have access to your voicemail messages .you can forward them , delete them , fast forward them. [CLS] [SEP]what ever you have to do with your messages you can do from your cell phone .if you should have a phone with an answering machine built in like this one , you can generally call that number and again hit pound or another code and that will give you access to your voicemail .not every telephone can allow you to check remotely , you should know that .older machines. [CLS] [SEP]you wo n't be able to do that .it has to have a certain technology that talks to the phone line and that gives you access to your voicemail .so just do n't forget your pin , and do n't forget your password when you have to make those phone calls. [CLS] [SEP]and you 'll have a piece of paper handy. [CLS] [SEP]and you 'll get those messages down pretty easily .kathy pabst robshaw total telephone effectiveness .
i 'd like to talk a little bit now about hiking gear .i remember when i started hiking i used athletic shoes. [CLS] [SEP]but now i use hiking shoes. [CLS] [SEP]they have a little better tread .they have significantly better tread .sometimes you 're going up and down in hiking country and i learned a trick .actually from people who backpack a lot and that 's to tie a little overhand. [CLS] [SEP]knot. [CLS] [SEP]about half way up your instep .which keeps the shoe more secure .i have a narrow foot and that keeps my narrow foot from sliding forward when i 'm going downhill .i like to wear loose comfortable pants preferably out of quick dry fabric .even in this , even the heat in warmer weather i wear long pants .some people wear shorts. [CLS] [SEP]but i like to wear long pants .just because you do come in contact with the rock and brush sometimes and in a contest you 're not going to win .so i protect my skin with long pants and i often wear a long sleeved shirt for the same reason. [CLS] [SEP]but i recommend layering .i 've got a light shirt on underneath a vest .i 've got fleece in my pack and. [CLS] [SEP]in my pack i 've have whatever i think i need .in the way of food i like a hydration bladder and maybe a watter bottle as well but the bladder is really handy too .so you can stay hydrated you can keep drinking as you hike .this is a little trick one of my hiking mentors carol. [CLS] [SEP]sue harris taught me a long time ago and that 's to cover the tip of your mouth piece with a old , with a film cannister .cut a little x in the lid and. [CLS] [SEP]this way it protects it from the dirt when you set it down .it keeps it from getting smashed if you throw it in a van with a bunch of other packs .the water does n't leak and anyway that 's a little tip .i always like to wear a bandanna in the heat this comes in very hand because you can soak it in cold water and keep yourself a lot cooler .i always recommend a hat preferably with a chin strap .sunglasses are nice sunscreen of course. [CLS] [SEP]and then i recommend using a hiking stick .i use a single stick in this country .trekking poles i save for more extreme hiking conditions but this canyon country around here. [CLS] [SEP]this stick works just fine for me .one time i was hiking. [CLS] [SEP]and i lost the stick down a cliff. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's when i learned to put a loop on it of some kind .so there 's a hole drilled in here with leather. [CLS] [SEP]and then i learned to put my hand up through bottom like this. [CLS] [SEP]and that allows me to just hold my stick loosely and not get blisters on my hand because if i do lose my grip on it , it 's still attached .some people ask me if i 'm holding my stick together with duct tape .well not really i just roll some duct tape around the stick because it comes in handy under some circumstances .mainly as a temporary band-aid .if a foot starts getting a hot spot you can just slap duct tape on it .put your sock back on and keep hiking .
you should not use any type of artificial drying method to speed this part of the process .the use of artificial drying methods could cause the slabs to crack during firing .arrange your slabs in the furnace in a manner that allows the heat from the flame to circulate freely .separate your slabs with props made for high temperatures .place a prop at each corner of the slab .continue stacking slabs using props to maintain proper gaps for circulation .close and secure the furnace door .on the furnace door is a view finder .close or cover the view finder .failure to do so will result in significant heat loss .light the furnace to begin the firing process .firing will take 9 to 10 hours .thank you .
now let 's talk about elimination tone .that is how quickly and how efficiently your bowels can eliminate waste .let 's talk about the tone of the bowel .you know you can work out and increase the tone of your muscles .well , those are skeletal muscles .in your bowel , it 's a smooth muscle .there 's three elements that will help you with the tone in your bowel ; sodium , potassium and magnesium .let 's talk about sodium first .sodium neutralizes the gas of any food that may putrefy .some of the foods that have sodium in them are apples , beets and carrots .potassium speeds the transit time in the bowel , which is a very good thing because you want to eliminate your waste fairly quickly .it also neutralizes the acids in the bowel .so , the acids do n't destroy or irritate the bowel walls and cause pain and bleeding and infection .these foods are apples , almonds and bananas .magnesium , the third , acts like a laxative and it relaxes the bowel wall so that the waste products can move through smoothly .some of these foods are apples , brown rice and cabbage .all three are contained in apples .so , it 's true ; an apple a day can keep the doctor away if you keep your bowels moving .and it works hand in hand with bowel issues and helps eliminate waste ; wastement in the bowels .
before we begin this look you have to make sure you have all the products and tools that you need .cause this look is very specific. [CLS] [SEP]so you definitely need a nice luminous heavy duty mascara .something that is dark black and that is really going to coat the lashes. [CLS] [SEP]cause you want these lashes to look big and beautiful .you also either want to do false eyelashes. [CLS] [SEP]or you want to do individual eyelashes. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to go with the individual eyelashes .cause i want to kind of make my own cook lash look. [CLS] [SEP]but if you find false eyelashes that you love make sure you invest in them and glue as well. [CLS] [SEP]cause you ca n't put the lashes on without the glue .also this is a look where you can use really kind of deep rich makeup something for the cheeks like a red burgundy blush something that looks like that , pinch cheek look on .also for the lips anything glossy and glittery in the reds or burgundy family. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to use something like this and put a gloss on top of it and just kind of deepen it .you can get really funky with this look. [CLS] [SEP]like i said earlier it 's that old hollywood starlit. [CLS] [SEP]meets flapper. [CLS] [SEP]so you can put that very traditional old hollywood look with these funky colors and kind of sex it out .
so ivy , there 's different kinds of ivy .but i would say that this is a pretty typical looking , kind of an ivy design .so there are so many variations on just this one theme alone .that you could decide whether you want to paint this to look very realistic .or you want to paint it the way , i just did with a brush .but in any event , you want to think in terms of having it be , you want it to be even .in terms of how you 're placing , placing the vine .you want it to be even in terms of shapes .and you know , just think in terms of what the real , the real plant would do .how the leaves would turn towards the sun .and stay out of each other 's way .so what you 're after here is something that 's very even .and then you can go ahead .and you can add other things to the vine .maybe , it 's not an ivy vine , maybe it 's some other kind of a vine .where you can start to add flowers .so what you 're doing is , you 're , you 're making something richer and richer .and there 's also one other thing that i want to point out to .and that 's a really neat thing .a really neat idea .and it 's called grissaile , which is french word meaning gray .so the first grissaile paintings were probably done in gray .and what that means is , you 're doing something that starts to look sculpted .but it 's really only with one , with one color .so , here 's an example of a piece that i did for a calendar .and this is i would call this grissaile .because it 's face is all one color .so , it 's a matter of washes .it almost begins to it almost begins to look like a pencil drawing .pencil painting , even .and what i 've done here is i. [CLS] [SEP]'ve given it some sense of shadow .so that it just gets a little bit more three dimensional .so , now i 've mentioned the idea of shadow .and i just want to show you .because a lot of times , shadows are used with lettering .so , the way i do shadows is , i decide where i want my light source to be coming from .so i would imagine .let 's say we imagine that the light source is coming from this direction .o.k. [CLS] [SEP]?so , if the light source is coming from this direction , then everything on the other side is going to take a shadow .so , let 's see if i can figure this out .so this would be , this would be the shadow side .
we 're going to get into our first stretch now .this is for our quads because once we go into the v stepping , we want to make sure that our legs are nice and stretched out because that 's a lot of the strain on the quads .that 's the muscle that you 're going to be using the most during that .so all you 're going to do is you 're going to stand up straight , grab one leg , grab one foot , bend at the knee and just pull .you want to make sure you do n't have too much of an arch in your back .you want to be right here , sitting .you want to make sure your hips are nice and square. [CLS] [SEP], you do n't want to turn out or anything like that , nice and straight like this .you 're going to do it to the alternate side as well .you 're going to take about 20-30 seconds on each side , making sure you feel that from the top all the way down to the bottom .you really want to get them nice and stretched out after you get them warmed up , going to be real important when we cover our v stepping .so after we do the stretch here and we switch over to the other side , you can also do these on the ground where you pretty much sit here and do a cross this way .this is going to cover a lot of the front of the hip as well , not just the top of the quad .so this is going to help stretch our hips as well .we have a number of other stretches for the hips on our third show .
hi this is stacey from expert village and this video clip i will show how to boil water , oil , and food coloring . [CLS] [SEP]first we need to add 3 3/4 cup of water into your pot after the water you need to add 3 tablespoons of oil directly into the pot , the last thing you need to add is food coloring , i choose to add blue the more your add to the water and oil the dark it will be and less you have the lighter it will be . [CLS] [SEP]after you have stirred the mixture and you place it on the stove , then set it on medium high and wait for it to boil .
i 've been doing wood working for many years. [CLS] [SEP]and i want to talk about some safety issues for a drill press .the first safety issue is right here if you can see it. [CLS] [SEP]i just put this bit in here .if i turn it on this guy is going to come flying out and it is not that uncommon , you are focused on something else. [CLS] [SEP]and you put it in. [CLS] [SEP]and you are doing here , and there it is .so always take this out .the next issue is sleeves , long hair anything that , because again you are focusing in here , this thing is going very fast and anything can get wrapped around it. [CLS] [SEP]so make sure your clothes , hair that would be there .speed , you want to be at the right speed for the right bit here .this is a pretty big bit .you want to be not that fast and this is where you change your speeds and you want to slow that one up a little bit .so that is pretty good .a bit like this , a circle cutter , especially when it is large you want to be very slow , you want to make sure whatever the work you have is clamped down because this can grab and take the whole thing off .this is a little bit more of a dangerous thing .that 's a wonderful bit. [CLS] [SEP]but you have got to be real careful with this .the other bit that you have to be very careful with is one that looks like this .you notice it has a screw tip .this is not to be used in a drill press .the drill press you want to be able to control how you bring it down and back up again .once this bit , once this screw tip starts in the wood it is going to suck it down. [CLS] [SEP]and you are no longer in control .this is for a hand held drill and you need to avoid using something like this on the drill press .i 'm robert markey and. [CLS] [SEP]we 've been talking about safety tips for a drill press .
ok.now that you 're ready to record your drum track what we do ; what we 'll do is go ahead and push play on your sequencing system which is illustrated on mine by my arrow pointing to the right and also down here .i 'm going to click play and you should hear the metronome or your click track .this should be set at eighty-five .make sure , like. [CLS] [SEP]right here it says mine is at eighty-five .if you 're not hearing anything that means your click is turned off .see , if it 's off you wo n't hear anything , but when i click it back on i hear my click track again .so , just make sure you can hear your click track real good .then as you listen to your click track we 're going to do a simple beat .ok.now , i want you to notice as your bar is moving ; remember what we talked about as far as your rhythm is concerned .these are all measures and it 's four beat , four beats lay in a measure .one , two , three , four , one. [CLS] [SEP]; the one will always hit on your number , on the next number .so , as you listen to your click track the drum beat we 'll perform will be a simple beat .we 're going to lay our drums for now all on the one .on every one is where we 'll place our drum .so , as it comes back around to the one is where we 'll begin .there 's eight , we want to hit there .then on the two is where to hit and then one. [CLS] [SEP]the three and four ; four , two , three , four , five , two , three , four , six , two , three , four , seven , two .that 's where we 'll lay all our drum tracks .ok .
things you want to know about bouldering. [CLS] [SEP], you probably want a crash pad , softens the landing , helps for any rocks on the ground , things on the ground that you might otherwise trip over .you probably want a buddy for spotting because unless you have a whole bunch of crash pads , it 's not going to cover all the landing .you 're going to have your climbing shoes on. [CLS] [SEP], you 're going to want some chalk most likely because the climbing is difficult .you want to think about the climb and realize that you 're not on a rope , you want to make sure that you understand where you are going and use your good judgment about how high you 're willing to go off the ground .some higher boulder problems called high ball can post some serious risk of injury if you blow it up high .technique , it gets pretty advanced , if you do n't make it the first time , keep trying .
the first choice i have is to use paper trays like these .you can sort your paper by color in these .the only thing with doing it this way is these do take up a little bit more space .if you use this option , you 're going to want to make sure you have plenty of space to store these .you also can use plastic drawers , but again , you 're going to be looking , needing the space to store all of those .the second option we have is a paper crate , or you could use a file cabinet drawer , or something like this with file folders .you can store all of your papers in here by color , but if you have 12x12 papers , you will have to buy a crate or a file system that is made for the 12x12 , whereas this is meant for 8 1/2x11 .this saves a , a lot of space and is still very easy to access all of your papers .a third option we have is to use an envelope like this .you can pick these up at any craft store .these come in 8 1/2x11 or 12x12 .a great thing to use these for is if you want to organize your scrapbook papers by theme .for example , in here i have a school theme , so i have my papers and my stickers to keep all of my school scrapbooking things together .you then can store these in a basket or crate for easy access .
now , it is time to fold a jersey .and , we 're going to use a champion fold even if the team is n't a champion team .alright .some of you may want to hang your jerseys .because , you 're so pumped .or , you might want to put them in a frame .we 're going to fold the jersey efficiently .so , truly shake those wrinkles out of the jersey .and , then place it flat down .spread it out .and , the material is usually great .so , we can take up small space and fold it several times .because , it 's still going to be flat .so , let 's take the bottom to the top one time .and , then take it up again two times .bring that sleeve over to the center .smooth it out .but , again the material for these jerseys are great .so , it should be nice and sleek .and , take the other side to the center .and , then fold it in half .if you really want , you can fold it in half one more time for the champion fold .
the next pose in our insomnia series is the standed puppy pose .to come into this pose , you are going to start from heros pose ( verodrasana ) .you are going to take you knees as wide as your mat , but keep your toes together .you are going to walk the hands forward , reaching the fingertips as far as they can go .keep the energy moving out through the fingertips .then , you are going to drop your head .however is most comfortable for you .if you 'd like to turn your head to the side , and lay it down. [CLS] [SEP]you can do that .you can alternate sides .or the `` proper way '' to to it is to put your head on the floor .keep reaching the fingertips out actively .that 's what is going to create the stretch in the spine .you are trying to create a little bit of pull between your fingertips and your sitz bones .so , you are going to pull your sitz and tailbones back and reach the fingertips forward , creating some opposition to make a nice , long stretch .try that , come into the pose and take a few good long breaths in and out through the nose .anywhere between five and twenty breaths .however you feel most comfortable .
so what we are going to do is drop the fries down in the oil one at a time like we did once .( two at a time )what we are going to do is we want to keep them in the oil for about a minute and what will happen it will actually start to puff up a little bit .so while they are cooking you are going to want to make sure that they are not touching too much because if they are touching they are not cooking .one thing to be aware of is that when using duck fat when cooking french fries like this they will turn darker than normal .cause duck fat is n't really clear like a lot of other oils you can use if used vegetable oil. [CLS] [SEP]it ( canola oil )it wo n't turn nearly dark .so we have about twenty more seconds to go on these before they are ready for action and what we are going to do is get our salt and pepper here ready to go .cause once these come out of the oil and put them on this tray is right when they need to be seasoned because if you get them while they are hot , if you season them while they are hot while the oil is still on them , the seasoning sticks to the fries better and it will really kind of get in there .that is our timer already .so you will see that our fries is looking nice and tasty .like i said do n't be concerned about the dark appearance that is just the duck fat doing its thing .as we pull them all out. [CLS] [SEP]you 're going to move fairly quickly because like i said you want to season these things while they are still oily and hot .so here we are with our fries. [CLS] [SEP], i 'll just do a little run over with my salt first and notice how i have them laid out evenly , that way we can evenly distribute the salt .do n't be afraid of over seasoning these just because a lot of this is going to fall off .i do n't know about you. [CLS] [SEP]but i put pepper on my french fries , there you go a little salt and pepper .that is everything right there for your fries and now we need is a little ketchup. [CLS] [SEP]and we are good , so let us move on .
training your dog to pull a cart is an interesting idea and one that would probably be useful for you to get a professional to help you to make sure that you have the proper equipment so your dog is n't injured or frightened at any point .but basically you would use a good sturdy harness for your dog that protects them while they 're being pulled , and with some good cushioning on it , you would use a harness that would n't put any pressure on their neck or their back .and initially you would put the harness on your dog , make sure that they 're comfortable and happy , maybe play with your dog , make sure that having the harness on is not a stressful experience , and then little by little you would allow them to drag something light with the harness , again , working very hard to make sure is enjoying it , lots of treats or toys or play .and then working up to pulling something like a cart .
okay .now , it 's time to put the wheel in place .okay .so once you get the new one and , again , it 's all assembled , we are going to use a couple of parts from the old one .it 's going to be this metal piece here , and actually the two screws themselves .now , the ones we discarded , because it becomes new , are these tiny , little brass lock washers here .those usually disintegrate , one of the first things to go .so all we 're going to do to make sure. [CLS] [SEP]we 've got everything in place is just to put the happy little brass washer in there .look at that .you like that , do n't you ?okay .here we go -- and setting 'em in place .now , this assembles -- this assembly is ready to go .just a word about this , this shield over here is double-notched and it 's done that way because if it 's in this position , it goes on one wheel and. [CLS] [SEP]if it 's in this position , it goes on the other .so you want to just keep that in mind .if you buy this new , you actually knock out the one -- excuse me -- by itself new , just --if you need to replace this , you 'll knock out the one that you need , all right .so we 're going to use this one to put on the side wheel over here. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to simply go in this place .now , this maneuver is a bit tricky , and i hope that you can see this here , but we 're going to take the original hex slots , and we 're going to seat them deep inside of the plastic .now , it has a hex nut shaped-hole for it to go in , if you will , but you got ta sorta drop it in there , sort of shake it .oh , look at that .it 's beautiful .and a little shake .shake one in , one out , all right .now , we got both of them in there .now , you got ta sorta jam your fingers in , set the wheel in place .okay .and , again , set perfectly because i 've got that over there .grab this , keep it balanced , do n't breathe .now breathe .no , just kidding .it happens all the time .just go ahead and set it back in there , and we 'll go with another little technique here .you got ta do what works , right ?let 's see if we can get it in , and ah , look at that .it 's beautiful , huh ? and reach over for your machine --oh !it helps to do pilates before you do this .double-checking , that it 's set on its lower torque setting and , one and , beautiful .and now , we 've got a newly assembled wheel .
in this clip we learn how to play the actual game of derby .the pivots wear stripes on their helmets .the job of the pivot is to set the pace of the pack .so however fast the pivots are going. [CLS] [SEP], that 's how fast the pack goes .their job is also to be the last line of defense for the jammer to get through .so if the pivot sees the opposing jammer , she 's going to try and knock her out , or if her jammer 's coming through , she 'll try and block the other pivot from knocking out her jammer .the jammers have stars on their helmets .the jammer 's job is to get through the pack and score points .all of the blockers within the pack are trying to either assist or knock out the jammers , whether it 's an opposing or a friendly jammer .that 's what determines how they 're going to act towards her .within the pack , they 're also trying to block each other and knock each other out before they take out the jammer .the jammers have to make their way through the pack .as soon as they clear the pack once , they are free to lap the pack , come through again and for every hip that they pass of an opposing player , they score one point .so each time through the pack , they can score up to four points a piece .if they lap the other jammer , they score a point off the jammer for a total of five .
so you started practicing the tip. [CLS] [SEP]and you remember , keep it at the beginning of the sample the whole time , now 's the time to put it along with music .ready ?let 's go .remember , it 's got to be at the beginning of the sample the whole time .even though it 's two notes very , very fast , it kind of sounds like one .remember , keep it at the beginning of your hand .this is a mostly finger , maybe a little bit of hand , but do n't try and worry about your arm too much .this is where your work with the baby scratch will pay off because if you had n't been practicing the baby scratch at the same time , if you have n't been practicing the baby scratch keeping it at the beginning of the sample , the scratch is not going to work for you at all .so remember , beginning of the sample .
so which camera should i select to buy ?there 's quite a few cameras out there .in the past , there was like around a dozen film cameras , so you could choose pentax , nikon , canon , minolta , yashica , exakta , padika , and quite a few more .but digital cameras are now made by smaller companies , and they buy their optics elsewhere in a lot of cases .so not only do you have those camera makes , you have companies like kodak , panasonic , and all different makes and models .you have over a hundred different brands of cameras and the number of models is just endless , and every year they come out with a new model .so , how do you pick a camera ?well we 're going to talk about just consumer cameras to start with .
working on those intermediate obliques with the ab roller .what we want to do , start off with those knees about hip width apart , take our ab roller in hand , both of our hands are on the grips , take our ab roller down .you want to pull that belly button in the spine , i do n't know how many times i can say that .but you always want to pull your belly button into the spine when you 're doing any type of ab or oblique exercise .and then what we 're going to do , is we 're going to roll a little bit to the right .you 're going to come out a little bit farther than what we did with the beginner .so you 're going to come out , maybe like three feet .and then you 're going to go over to the left side .and then you 're going to go back to that right side .you want to do about two sets of ten to twelve reps.again , two sets of ten to twelve reps. [CLS] [SEP]and just roll it from side to side .if you want , you can stay on one side , focus on that one side first , and then come over to the other side .want to make sure you get both .working those obliques .i can feel it working my obliques right here .feels great .and that 's how you do intermediate obliques with the ab roller .
i am going to show you the lady 's step for basic step .it 's 1-2-3-2-2-3-3-2-3-4-2-3.the foot positions would be left foot back , right foot to side and close left foot to right foot , then right foot forward , left foot to side and close right foot to left foot .the foot technique is toe heel , toe , toe heel , heel toe , toe , toe heel .the rise of fall of this step is down on heels , then begin to rise on step 2 and continue to rise on step 3 and at the end of step 3. [CLS] [SEP]you just step down .then , one step 1 begin to rise at the end of step 1 , then continue rising on step 2 , continue to rise on step 3 and at the end of step 3 go down .let 's it and practice , 2-3-2-2-3-3-2-3-4-2-3-1-2-3-2-2-3-3-2-3-4-2-3-1-2-3-2-2-3-3-2-3-4-2-3 .
this will be the first step that i like to use while curling hair .first step i like to do is go through the hair with your wide tooth comb .take sections with the rat tail part of it , be sure to make sure to keep it away from your clients. [CLS] [SEP]eyes , you do n't want to have a disaster in poking her eyes out .you want to make sure when you are doing yourself or clients hair to make sure that you are pointed in and it is facing away from them .section through the hair always going away not near the eyes .i like to section smaller sections and the reason why is what we 're doing. [CLS] [SEP]is we 're going through and combing through and knots that are in the ends .any tangles that are in the ends starting off with your wide tooth comb .take your next section repeat the process .if you do encounter any tangles that you ca n't get through that. [CLS] [SEP]are a bit stuck and feel that you need to use something to lubricate the ends , you can go to your spray shine .and away from your clients face a little spray on the ends and come back through. [CLS] [SEP]and it should easily slide right back through .
for instance , this comes in handy. [CLS] [SEP]let 's say when we are doing a search for techincal information .let 's put in `` clean mini disk '' and we do a search that we end up getting a lot of results from merchants offering to sell us either some type of mini disks or cleaning kits. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's not. [CLS] [SEP]what i 'm really looking for .i am looking for technical information on how to actually clean the mini disk .so , what i want to do is in my search , i am going to limit my search to just the words `` clean mini disk . [CLS] [SEP]''i am going to put a minus sign next to the word `` merchant . [CLS] [SEP]''now when google does the search , it is going not look for any items any pages that have the word `` merchant ''it 's not going to return those pages in my results .so , therefore , i am going to get a more specific search and a much more specific results to exactly what i 'm looking for .
veterinarians generally start , currently , at about $ 60 ,000 a year .i think is the median salary for veterinarians across the country .in addition to that now - something that was not available when i started practicing - most veterinarians , or most veterinary clinics , start their new associates out with the base salary as well as commission meaning that they actually get a percentage , and i think 20 % is about the average , on production .back in the early 90 's. [CLS] [SEP]i think that the starting salary was around $ 33 ,000 a year .the veterinarian who is capable of doing medicine and surgery has a much greater earning potential because they will hospitalize cases and work up diabetics , kidney disease animals , animals with heart disease , etc , and keep the animal in the clinic for several days to get them regulated .veterinarians who are capable of doing surgery , not just the routine procedures if you will , the spays and neuters and dental cleanings etc , also can increase their earning potential by that mechanism , and then you also have people who do orthopedic surgery as well as soft tissue surgery .these procedures greatly increase the ability for a veterinarian to earn more money .the veterinarian field is growing , i think , rapidly .we have a number of vet schools in the united states , and have a number of veterinary students.the average for most schools is probably 80 students per class .some go as high as 120 per class , and if you look around as your driving there are a number of veterinary clinics in various areas and they 're all within 2-3 blocks of each other , and sometimes much closer .so it 's a very large field and there is a number of individuals who have pets and they care very deeply for the pets and most get great care .
so another performance that you can give is a solo recital .and the basic principles of recital pretty much still apply except that when you 're tuning you 're not going to have anyone to tune with you .so it 's important in the very beginning , as well as when you 're learning to tune , to really learn to tune on your own .a lot of the times you will have piano near you , in your lesson you 'll probably have a piano near you to tune with , or a tuner .but when you 're giving a recital you 're not going to be able to bring your tuner on stage , so you want to make sure that by the time that you give your recital that you really know what that a is supposed to sound like , the a that you need to play .so really making sure you practice your tuning not only with a piano and with a tuner , but also learning how to tune by ear because when you give a solo recital , when you tune you 're going to have to just hear that d minor chord in your head and just start tuning your a , and then tuning all of your other strings against the a. [CLS] [SEP]the other thing about playing solo is that your dynamics are going to be slightly different because you do n't have another instrument or anyone else playing with you , your dynamics do n't have to be as loud .
romeo and juliet are lying dead on each other 's arms and we have answered that question what is going to happen to romeo and juliet .now , still , there are more things to explore .what happens to the capulets ?that 's still a dramatic question that has n't been answered .and now , we have montague and capulet , will they ever reconcile ?and the answer is it took romeo and juliet dying to bring these two enemies together .that is a dramatic question that is answered after the conflict .what happens to verona ?what happens to the other characters ?sometimes in a play , this is also revealed .in hamlet , fortinbras has returned .fortinbras has been brought into the plot .what 's going to happen with fortinbras ?is fortinbras going to be victorious in his crusade against denmark ?and at the end , when hamlet is killed , after that , horatio has his speech where he tells aught of woe. [CLS] [SEP]and he tells fortinbras about all the horrible things that happened .and then fortinbras says that hamlet will be remembered .that is a moment where we realize what will happen after the play .this gives us a look into what happens in the future. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's important .a good story should n't end at the ending .it should have a continuation .you should be able to see that something is going to happen after the story .not having any questions but life will go on and this is how it will go on .we 'll go on happily or will there be more tragedy to come .
this is one of a litter of orphan kittens .they were born and never actually nursed from their mother .there 's a volunteer , here , who 's helping them along by hand feeding them. [CLS] [SEP]and they 've just gotten baths and been cleaned up which is why he 's all wet .but i 'll show you about hand. [CLS] [SEP]feed a baby and what else to do , he really likes this .getting really excited .okay , you can hear them suckle and how they grasp the bottle with their feet , like that , and he 's chewing on the nipple a little bit .let 's get it right centered. [CLS] [SEP]so he can suck .there we go !you can actually see the air bubbles going into the formula , there .this is special kitten milk replacement formula .and you can see his little face moving as he 's nursing .and , when you see the air bubbles coming into the formula that means he 's actually getting formula out of the bottle .sometimes kittens will have a weak suckle reflex and although they 're nursing they 're not actually getting any nutrition .so you need to watch for that .after a kitten finishes nursing from a bottle , they 'll be sort of full and kind of sleepy .so they should just lay down and have a little nap when they 're done. [CLS] [SEP], that 's a sign that they 've had enough nutrition .one of the other things that you need to do with orphan kittens is stimulate them to urinate and defecate .so you take a moist towel and you rub the perineal area , their anus and their urethra area with a little towel to stimulate them to urinate and defecate .this is what mom does by licking them. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's very important because they do n't know how to void urine or feces on their own , so you have to stimulate that reflex for them .
this clock lives near me in north andover , and i service it periodically .but , uh , you 'll notice here it says b. [CLS] [SEP]willard .and there 's also a number there .for whatever reason , benjamin willard , unlike his ...his brothers , liked to number his clocks , and it 's made it interesting for researchers to try to find out where the various clocks are , and keep a list and a reference of benjamin willard 's output .this is out of roxbury-style case , but perhaps simpler , too .again , not as big a maker , not as much of a businessman , but he made good quality clocks .this is a white dial , calendar aperture here , we have. [CLS] [SEP]the seconds bit there. [CLS] [SEP]that 's showing the passage of the seconds .but relatively simple compared to what his brothers aaron and simon were making in boston at the time .
your arms , your hands , and the club head , goes down the line longer .down the line , down the line , down the line .down the line , down the line , down the line .down the line , as opposed to a flat swing , that is much more around and around .now , one of the things that jack felt was a necessity , was staying behind the ball while he was hitting , so he would have the ball off his left heel .wide , wide , wide , stay behind the ball .his lower body went behind the ball , behind the ball , staying behind the ball , hitting the ball from behind his body .if it ever went like this , he was in a lot of trouble , if his body slid .he wanted his weight , he wanted everything to be behind the ball , and that was so important for him to be upright , and down that same line , and to stay behind the ball .
alright folks in this clip. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to teach you how to draw your own comic strip , and the first thing you 're going to want to do is get out a ruler and create a certain amount of panels for the comic strip to play out in .now of course you 're going to want to decide exactly what you want to fill those panels with first , before you go and create them .so do that first , plan out exactly which frame is going to contain what , and then lay out as many as you need .we 're going to start with the first one here , and essentially the entire point of a comic strip is to tell a story .so , we 're what going to do is use this concept and basically figure out a way to tell our own little mini story and using this sequential method you 're supposed to use when you draw your comic strip.so , first you establish your character in the opening panel , i guess you should say , just kind of minding his business in the case , walking along his merry way , and at this point we have absolutely no idea what 's going on .we will give the audience a clue going to give him a golf club .so we got a guy walking through the first frame holding a golf club .now , as we move over , you notice that this particular frame has no square , now. [CLS] [SEP]the reason why i 'm doing this is i want to call particular attention to this frame , because this frame is where the , i guess you could say , the , the thing that sets the chain of events in motion , the catalyst for this particular comic strip happens .this is where the , i guess you could say , the , everything kind of like starts to unfold .it 's the pivotal frame .so to call attention to the pivotal frame , i am not drawing a box around it , so people like consciously or subconsciously notice that this is different than all the other frames , and they 'll come to find out why once they get to the very end .now the way to do that , i mean , essentially is , that 's a subtle one of those subconscious sort of things. [CLS] [SEP], you 're not supposed to draw a lot of attention to it .now what is it that causes this guy to kind of look and stop for a second .we 've already established he 's on a golf course , so from off frame somewhere we hear someone shout .he has no idea. [CLS] [SEP]what 's coming , no idea what 's going on .move on to the next panel , as we continue on our story .all of a sudden out of nowhere , we going to draw a golf ball striking our poor , poor , golfer in the head , and there are ways we , a myriad of ways we can show that he just got hit in the head .one thing , his arm was down , and i 'm going to put it up now , put his legs kind of in a wobbly position , show little shakes around his body ,show that he just got knocked by something in the head , and it does n't hurt to add a little verbal interpretation or verbal sign of what just happened .ball comes out of nowhere , smacks him in the head .which brings us to our fourth and final frame , where our disgruntled golfer angrily , now feels the back of his head , and again , this is amateur stuff. [CLS] [SEP]obviously right now. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]just , i 'm just literally making this up as i go , but , you see that i 'm , the whole point here. [CLS] [SEP]right ?you could even hold , have him holding the golf ball in his hand if we wanted to .but the point is we used each and every panel to tell a sequence of events that adds up to a full and complete story .golf club will be on the ground now , and he is not happy , maybe the person from off screen says he 's sorry .that essentially is how you tell a sequential story and this is how you create your own comic strip by coming up with a sequence of events and putting them down one by one in each individual box .
the teleprompting business is not for everyone .whether you start out being an operator , or become a thriving business , it can be stressful , and the work comes in seasons .especially , if you live in an area like denver , where there are definite seasons for the business .many operators have two and three freelance jobs , like script supervising .i also have another freelance job , like producing and editing .it 's the nature of the business , as they say .there are the rewards .some shows can be unforgettable with their stage design music , and ambiance .i 've made a lot of friends .i 've met a lot of interesting people , and politicians , stars , and musicians .you can work in some beautiful places , and if you 're lucky , you can even be a bit of a tourist , but to me , teleprompting really means helping a speaker , give that special retirement speech , or prompting the actor , that is doing a nonprofit commercial about needy children , or helping the corporate employee. [CLS] [SEP], that 's never seen a teleprompter before , but they pulled off a great scene on camera , and it all began with lucille ball .imagine that .thanks for listening .
hi , today we are going to talk about form w-4 .the purpose of form w-4. [CLS] [SEP]so your employer can withhold the federal income tax from your pay .you would fill this out when you begin a job. [CLS] [SEP]but you may want to review this once a year especially if your tax situation changes and if you have additional dependents or anything that may effect your withholding .to get started on the form w-4. [CLS] [SEP]the first thing we are going to do is type in name , address , and social security number and filing status .so we would begin with line 1 first name and initial .last name , social security number , home address .then we would go to 3 and since james smith is married we would check married , his last name is not different from his social security card so we do n't need to do that .so that completes this section of the form .
and similarly you can add to the beginning of any number like if we have a `` three '' here. [CLS] [SEP]then that 's `` san wan jui qian san bai san shi wu ''that 's `` wan '' .so beyond that we carry that to `` million '' , `` ten '' well `` one hundred '' `` one hundred thousand '' , `` one million '' and `` ten million '' and when is comes to `` one hundred million ''we have to introduce the word `` yi '' .that 's `` ten million ''so so far we can form a lot of numbers with this system .using `` yi , er , san , si , wu , liu , qi , ba , jiu '' and then `` shi '' , `` bai '' , `` qian '' , `` wan '' , `` yi '' with the help of `` ling '' .hopefully this will give you a general idea how the chinese number system is formed .
today we 're going to demonstrate some techniques on how to work with tendinitis .the kind of tendinitis we 're going to address in this segment is commonly referred to as tennis elbow .and more often than not it is accompanied with tightness in the flexor muscles and some weakness in the extensors , resulting in overuse problems of the tendon up here by the olecranon process .so frequently your client will tell you that they have some soreness or tenderness in this area .
what we 're going to demonstrate and talk about is how to properly tie off a flat headed axe for hoisting purposes .we take our piece of rope and we can either tie a figure eight on a bite or the simple bowline to start with .i 'm going to choose the bowline .we form the round turn , take our rope up and out of the hole around the tree and then back down through the hole. [CLS] [SEP]and we would secure our rope with the basic overhand safety knot to secure the end of the rope .we then take our bowline and slide it down over the handle of the axe to the head , wrap our rope up around the head and form two half hitches to be placed over the handle of the axe .the first half hitch slides about two thirds of the way down .the second half hitch is about a third of the way down .and , our axe is now secure and tied and ready to be hoisted to an upper floor area .
hi. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm brie. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're doing step .let 's go on to movement number two .five , six , ready go .one , two .on two lift your left heel because you have to be ready to propel your body to the next move .let 's try it again .one , two .let 's try it at this angle .one , two .let 's try it again .one , two .try it at this angle slowly , o.k . [CLS] [SEP]one , two .
 , it doesn ’ t have to be too fine , just something , not coarse , but not too fine , just so , for set aside .and then we have some beautiful louisiana pecans here. [CLS] [SEP], you just want to rough cut those as well , they ’ re just gon na add that extra little crunch ,that little , little extra something to the dish , that people will remember for a long time .again , just fairly rough cut , and then its time to put this on your dish .we ’ ll start with the pecans , spread them around liberally , make sure everybody gets some .again everybody going to get half a hen on this , these are very rich as you can see , very tasty and with all your side dishes that you ’ ll have .and then add it , the little parsley at the end. [CLS] [SEP], this ’ ll , it ’ ll add that color to it , just sprinkle that right over the top .
i 'm here today to show you how to make a glass jar .ok for this clip we 're going to take what we have already , which is all the color melted down together with the tube and now i 'm going to take a small piece of glass. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to take it down to a point. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to drag some of the colors together which will give it kind of a weird look , but it will definitely look really cool .alright. [CLS] [SEP]so we 're going to heat up our tube again , get it nice and hot .we got to get it hot enough. [CLS] [SEP]so the colors will drift in to each other here .so once we get this nice and hot here we 'll be able to do some dragging .alright. [CLS] [SEP]so now i 'm going to focus the flame. [CLS] [SEP]so we can just do one part at a time here .see what that did right there , it just added a little bit of craziness to it .we 're going to go reshape that a little bit now , get that back on there .we 'll give it a little quick puff here to blow it back out .alright we 're going to pop that back in the kiln real quick , and we 're going to drag it one more time. [CLS] [SEP]but , that 's pretty much what we wanted to get .
you have all the stones applied to the back as you can see here .now what i do after this is i start working on the limbs and get the limbs nice and relaxed while the back is relaxing .i ’ m working on the arm right now applying the massage lotion .start off with some petrasage , the spreading of the muscles throughout the arm and some compression .some times the stones tend to want to go where they will .we are doing some more stretches here and applying the knuckles to the underside of the arm .
hello , my name is gabriela garzon , and i 'm an image consultant with g.g . [CLS] [SEP]image & etiquette consulting , in coral gables , florida .in this clip , we 're going to talk about how to dress for overall success .basically , we all need to know , that we make a first impression , in the first fifty seconds , that somebody meet us , when we meet somebody .they make a complete impression of who we are , what we do , and our status , so that 's why it 's very important that we learn how to dress well , to have success in relationships , at business , and basically at anything that you do , in your life .the first thing that you need in your house , is a complete body mirror , so you can look at yourself , from every angle , and you can see your clothing ,how it drapes , how it looks , if it 's dirty , if it has good tailoring .one thing that we all need to be aware of , is that you should not hang into sizes .you might as well just wear things that fit you well , so your body and your body type , looks best with anything , anything that you wear .once again , before you leave your house , to whatever it is that you 're going to do , look at yourself in the mirror , from every angle ,that way you 'll know that you 're looking good , for every day success .once again , this is gabriela garzon , in coral gables , florida .
here 's another example of how you can move up the neck .so , you know , if you want to do kind of a basic kind of blues in a major scale , between e and a , where you can play an a here , but you can also kind of play it sort of up here .and i 've just got this one here on. [CLS] [SEP]the , this fret , let 's see what is it , the one , two , three , four , five , six ,i guess it 's the seventh fret and then fifth fret , with this string. [CLS] [SEP]and then , yeah .so this is also another way to play to play an a.so , you can really mix your sound up a lot if you kind of go back and forth between one type of a and the other .right ?so you can go ,so like .so the only point is , is do n't limit yourself to playing a chord only in the positions that you are familiar with .right ?so , even though you 're maybe used to only playing an a here , you know , you can also play it up here .even though you might be used to playing , you know , an e here. [CLS] [SEP], you know , you can also play one up here , you know .right ?and so , you know , anything that you kind of , you know , you can play an e style progression here. [CLS] [SEP], you can also play an a style progression .but , if you do it , you know , up the neck , where you 're playing in the key of e. [CLS] [SEP], you know , then you can really go back and forth between those two sounds .
hello my name is trevor. [CLS] [SEP], i work with monster pest control .we are located in american fork , utah .today we are talking about how to rid your home of insects .this topic is talking about how to rid your house naturally from ants .i 'm going to try , do a mixture of vinegar and water .vinegar , half vinegar , half water .and what you do is after you 've mixed your vinegar and water together. [CLS] [SEP], you get a fine mist of your spray and you go around all your doorways and windows .and you spray up and down all around where they are trailing around all of the areas .do this around all your doors and windows around your house including inside , if you need to do it inside the house where ever it might be .if you find the actual sight of the ants and their nest , you can take some boiling water and pour it directly into the nest .that will eliminate the colony .another way of getting rid of ants naturally on the outside of your home or inside is by using chili powder .with the chili powder you put it where you find the ants .if you find a trail of ants that are coming into your house or by a window seal just pour a little bit of chili powder along the area that you find and they will. [CLS] [SEP]basically they 'll come to it , take it back to the nest. [CLS] [SEP]and they 'll die off .
the next area we 're going to cover is stationary bikes .even on a slow day in a gym you can always jump up on a stationary bike and still get a good workout for cardio .what we like to do , is we like to point them so that they 're always facing the middle of the gym .even when you 're having a slow day , you can still jump on a bike and actually see what 's going on .one of the better things about sitting still and doing nothing is being able to watch , you can always learn , learn something new. [CLS] [SEP]just , just being on the stationary bikes .nothing extravagant , does n't have to have a dozen of them , a couple is good , this one here actually has the adjustable thing so you can actually increase or decrease the tension on it , this one here is a fan type bike where you 're actually getting an arm workout at the same time that you 're getting the pedal workout or you can just use the arm workout to control the fan type thing .and as you can see , with the snow outside , the ride on the stationary bike , being able to see what else is going on in the gym , is sometimes a good ride .thanks .
we also can add ear point for quit alcohol .so the ear points for helping stabilize the dopamine level while people quit drinking is called hypothalamus .hypothalamus is inside of this tubercles in the lower part of the ear .so this is inside of this tubercle .so that 's the hypothalamus .and it controls a lot of chemical production in the human body .and we can use this point to suppress appetite at the same time to let the brain produce more dopamine .so without alcohol people still feel pretty good .
look at this board and let , let 's see what the definition of hrt , well hrt is an acronym for hormonal replacement therapy .now this is a very popular treatment that doctors prescribe .it 's a prescribed program to treat hormonal imbalance associated with menopause .now there are several different things to understand about hrt therapy .now you can get hrt therapy two ways .you can get with only estrogen in the therapy. [CLS] [SEP], that 's all , that means that they 're only prescribe estrogen for you for the treatment. [CLS] [SEP]or you can get a combination of hormones in the therapy which is estrogen combined with other particular hormones like progesterone , estreen , progestin and testosterone .this combination is actually more recommended because then you 're going to decrease your long exposure of estrogen or higher exposure to estrogen in the body or unopposed estrogen because unopposed estrogen puts you at higher risk to developing certain cancers like endometrial cancer .so combination therapy is usually the number one recommendation for women entering menopause .now hrt is good because it helps the woman alleviate some of the symptoms of menopause. [CLS] [SEP]and that is. [CLS] [SEP]it helps with mood swings and hot flashes .it also helps women to maintain some memory because menopause women start to lose memory and a that 's a one of the symptoms .so hrt helps with that. [CLS] [SEP]and it helps with one of the conditions that you also find is vaginal dryness .that is a very common symptom that women experience when they go through menopause .now what is the hormonal replacement schedule ?well there are two different schedules that the doctor can put you on .and that is called the cyclic schedule or the continuous schedule .now the difference between the two is that in on a cyclic schedule you 'll basically taking estrogen hormone twenty five days in a month and then on the twelfth day they going to add progesterone and with this particular treatment schedule you 're going to , the woman is going to experience a period or bleeding like a monthly period , a menstrual period .so. [CLS] [SEP]but that 's induced , you know. [CLS] [SEP], synthetically it 's not natural. [CLS] [SEP]so the other schedule is the continuous schedule which means that you basically taking estrogen everyday .
many people commonly ask me how do you set up a plasma tv .to set up a plasma tv there 's a few basic steps .first you want to remove the tv from its packaging instead of from a secure stand .usually the weight is listed on the outside packaging of the tv .make sure that the stand you place it on has enough support to support the weight of the television set .second , you 're going to have to hook the power out and take the standard plug out of the box , plus the electric supply into the back of the tv and then into the wall .finally , you 'll have to hook up your input sources to it .there is two different cables used to.. [CLS] [SEP]to connect hd devices with the plasma screen tv .there 's a component cable on the left hand which has a red , green , and blue rca cable .there 's also an htmi cable which stands for high definition multimedia interface , this is the recommended cable for hooking up a plasma tv , 'cause this is a full digital cable that also transmits digital audio to a plasma tv .and that is how you hook up a plasma tv .

and that 's going to break down that paint and just get that loose .come back with a towel and wipe that off. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to be real careful that you do n't get the lacquer thinner on your walls or your painted surfaces .if you do n't like using chemicals , another way to get that paint off is just to take a razor blade and gently scrape that paint until that comes right off .now you probably do n't want to use lacquer thinner on woodwork because it would take the finish off .so you just want to be real careful with what you 're actually using this on .the next way to make our bathroom woodwork look a little bit better is just to take a rag with some warm water and mild detergent and just wipe down all of the woodwork .now , this is going to kind of help shine up that woodwork. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to make it look a little bit cleaner .next i 'll just be using a furniture polish to use on my woodwork .just a little bit on my rag should be sufficient and you 're just going to rub that in. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's just as the same as polishing a piece of wood furniture it 's going to shine that right up .
hi , i 'm jk dooley , and we 're talking a little bit about giclee reproduction and choosing canvas to print on .and we talked about this with paper as well .a lot of times. [CLS] [SEP]it 's people 's perception of the quality of your work .and a lot of people feel that canvas products are more valuable than paper products when it comes to art .so , since i paint on paper with my watercolors , i 've kind of combated that by printing on canvas , and so i can kind of cover both bases that way .and my choice , there 's people that do sell canvas pieces like this , they 're unstretched , and then the people take them and have them stretched and framed .however , i personally feel that this is a better-quality product to already have the piece stretched , and we 're going to talk about that a little later on how to stretch canvas and make a piece that i think is a very nice presentation .people are willing to spend more money for this piece than an unfinished piece .and i think it really adds a lot of quality to your work .so , again , perception is very important , so you want to make sure that you present a quality product to your customer , so they 're happy when they get their piece home .
hi , my name is lauren and today i 'm here to discuss how a curling works .within your curling iron there are two pieces of metal which are poor conductors of heat .as the resistance builds , so does the temperature and the temperature is very even and the increase is steadily .you can adjust your temperature through your temperature gauge on your curling iron .finer hair , you 're going to want to use more of a bit of a lower temperature .coarser hair , you can use a higher temperature .your hair can handle it a bit better .as you go through your hair , you 're going to pick it up .the reason why this works and the reason why it changes is the heat actually alters the hydrogen bonds in your hair .the hydrogen bonds will help you to temporarily change the hair texture of your hair and it create from straight hair , a nice wave .there are three bonds that your hair is comprised of and that is the hydrogen bond , the salt bond , and the disulfide bond .your disulfide bond is what actually predicts your hair texture .the hydrogen bond is a temporary way , in order to break that bond down , and curl your hair if your hair is very straight .it will help to kind of give you versatility within your style and go from curly to straight and back again , and that is how curling irons work .
it 's been washed and prep the same as before trim the ends off of your carrots and then cut them in large chunks like that and then put them all into the food processor the garlic , the onions , and the celery .and we 'll process that until its fine it changes the texture of the soup a little. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's just as tasty ( processing ) and let me show you the difference between the diced vegetables and the food processor vegetables .you use the same exact method of cooking except that you 've chopped your vegetables a little finer in the food processor as oppose to a dice , it 'll just have an effect texture to the soup .
another really great hint that i 'm going to give you and something you always want to keep in mind is try to avoid using black at all costs .in fact , i do n't even own any black paint .i did once , and i threw it away , because i wanted to make sure i did n't use it .because black can really destroy a painting .it can really muddy up your colors when you mix it with warm and cool colors .you want it , if you need a dark color , just go for a really condensed , really the darkest warm or cool color you have .if you 've got a red that is a really dark condensed red , try and use that , or mix it with some of the darkest blue that you have , or use the darkest blue for the black instead of black .like usually , you 're only going to need it with shading , because colors on things are n't usually that dark. [CLS] [SEP]so if you need a black , a dark color , try and use either. [CLS] [SEP]your darkest condensed red or your darkest condensed blue , or mixing them if you really need a black .
here is another style of opening that is called a trench .i just labeled it version four .the trench coat part of it is in where the jacket folds over and is off-center .this part right here , we have two pieces sewn together into one .and , it creates one whole seamless , not seamless because obviously there you have a seam .but , it is called a trench coat version of an opening because you are taking the traditional trench coat style. [CLS] [SEP]and you are pulling it in and putting it in one line .as opposed to having the four pieces , you are putting it ; you are just pulling it in .so therefore , it started out with its intentions being to be a trench coat in the classic sense , but then somebody thought somewhere , oh , we can do a trench coat like this .so , they turned it into that .that is what that it .
our folkloric version of the egyptian walk adds a little bit of the twist and a little bit of the up and down with the hip .so we 're going to step on the right foot , bring the left foot forward this time .and plant the ball of the foot firmly on the floor .bend both knees .and now the hip is going to do both the twist and the lift .so it 's going to aim up , corners up on a diagonal up to the upper corner and then drop back down .step feet back together. [CLS] [SEP], right foot comes forward , plant that ball of your foot up to the corner and drop down .now notice i 'm not doing a level change with this .so keep your level the same .good .make sure it 's not just a straight up and down , that you 're adding both the twist and the lift .step , lift , step , arms out away from the body , step , lift , step and lift .good .plant that toe , keep the knees bent .do n't let the arms fly around like they tend to do with those twists .keep them nice and stationary and twist .step and twist .good .up to the corner , twist , step and twist .very good .
okay , a pre-bend looks like this .we have a 15th fret pick on the b string .but in this case with a pre-bend , the arrow goes straight up .there 's a `` full '' so a whole step bend .but a pre-bend , you pick the note after you bend the string .so , we 're going to bend the string then pick the note .okay .so pre-bend , we 're going to bend the note first then pick it .so , the 15th fret b string. [CLS] [SEP]and it said a full bend so we 're going to make this 15th fret note sound like that .that 's a whole step or a full step. [CLS] [SEP]so that 's the pitch we want .so we bend then pick .that 's a pre-bend .now , in conjunction with pre-bends , what you see most of the time is what 's called a `` ghost bend ''and it 'll be a pre-bend pick with a release .so , in this case , a ghost bend would sound like this .you bend the string first and then release it .so we bend , pick , release .that 's called a ghost bend .and there 's another ghost bend .that 's so cool for adding little cool effects .so , a ghost bend is a pre-bend followed by a release .
and i am a modern dance instructor in austin , texas. [CLS] [SEP]and i am going to show you how to do plies in first position the way that we would do them in modern dance .so first of all we need to find first position and the way we are going to do this. [CLS] [SEP]is we are going to bring our feet together. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'm just going to open my toes up .i 'm going to bend my knees and open my toes up to where i feel comfortable .so i 'm not going to first any kind of turn out .i 'm not going to force my feet by shifting them one and then the other .i 'm just bending my knees , opening them up and standing up .they do not have to be very much turned out at all .this feels comfortable to me. [CLS] [SEP]so what i 'm going to do now is i 'm going to bring my stomach muscles in. [CLS] [SEP]kind of like i have a zipper that is zipping up through my stomach. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]dropping my tail bone , my lower back down. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to bend my knees. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to make sure that my knees are tracking my toes and that is a plie .so i 'm tracking my toes. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]keeping my back aligned and upright. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm tracking my toes .there is no beginning or end to a plie , it is just continually moving , continually moving .since it is modern dance. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm just going to let my arms rest at my sides .i want to make sure that my knees are tracking my toes. [CLS] [SEP]so they 're not here. [CLS] [SEP], that is not going to be good for my knees. [CLS] [SEP]and they 're further back then my toes. [CLS] [SEP]either they 're tracking my toes , plie , plie .so that 's the way that we would do plies in first position in modern dance .
the dime defense is a defense you 're gon na play because you are sure the offense is going to throw the football .the offense , one first indication might be that they only have the five offensive linemen .and then their gon na have their four wide receivers .now these four wide receivers can be in any combination .got your quarterback , and you also got your running back .now that running back may end being a fifth wide receiver .they take running back out of the game , then they add another wide receiver .so what you have is any empty back field .which means there is no threat to run the football , unless the quarter back is going to run it , you do n't have a back back here .but you do have five receivers which is the biggest threat the offense is going to have .and you have to defend those guys .
today i 'm going to teach you how to draw graffiti names .now , of course , there 's a infinite number of styles with graffiti , but we 're going to go with ...we 're going to with one here just to show you some basics .most of it is about names , so i 'm going to use my nickname , shatter .and , i 'm going to do this a little taller and thinner .just draw some basic letters to start with .you can draw it really lightly , go back and erase it later .or if you go over it in ink , then you can more easily erase the letters .and once you 've got your general arrangement , then you can get crazy with it .what i 'm going to do is , i 'm going to do every other letter big , every other letter small .and you can get really wild .we 're going to make this sort of look serrated .it 's always hard to draw a curve against your hand , so if you move the page around , it 'll work with your body better .and i 'm just going to do about four letters here .feel free to get your proportions , your angles , all of 'em odd , because graffiti is all about expression .so , then we 'll have a big a. [CLS] [SEP]we 're going to go with that serrated thing again .and you can see this is , you know , of course , a real rough ...you 'll refine it ... [CLS] [SEP].like i said , in ink , or just using your eraser .okay .now a lot of what ...and i 'm going to go ahead and erase the inner lines because i 'm going to put a little color on here .a lot of what graffiti is about is about color .you do n't ever see a whole lot of black and white graffiti .so we 're going to do a little bit of a two tone , a fade .now graffiti 's usually done with spray paint , but you 'll see it in all manner of mediums , really .most of it is made to mimic .if it 's not in spray paint , it 's made to mimic spray paint .so , what we 'll have here is a fade , which will look like a spray fade .i have a dark yellow going on there .i actually need to fade that out more .now this is not always the case .you do n't have to use fades , even in a lot of graffiti styles. [CLS] [SEP]you will see set lines , hard lines .one of the things you can do in colored pencil , is you can actually go through with a white blending , or a blending pencil to get more smoothness .that one came out a little rough , but it gives the impression of the spray paint feel , which is the very modernistic look that is the signature to graffiti style .and especially with names , when you 're ... [CLS] [SEP].you. [CLS] [SEP]want to really be expressive as to what you 're trying to get across because this is your name , or a name that has an emotional attachment , so you want ... [CLS] [SEP].you. [CLS] [SEP]want a feel behind it .and you can go through , and add details such as highlights .i would actually go through with , perhaps some paint , or something more solid to give that more of a white .or i would 've just left the white area .and i can go through here with , like. [CLS] [SEP], usually just use ...you can use black .in fact , feel free to use plenty of black , again , it 's dramatic , harsh ,which you want for this type of look .we 're going to put a shaded area there .i 'm using a dark red just to accent that ,but then i would go through , and i would go in with the black ,i 'm just going to use pencil for now , and add some dimensionality to it as if the letters were actually thick .and add some depth .and this way you 'll get a really cool look to graffiti names .
swinging the other way not knowing where the other one is .they 've been doing this for at least five years .seven years old , ten years old .boys , let 's see you chip to that hole with that seven iron .alright , that 's a little too hard .ok nice and easy gant .good , there 's a good one .a hair short but good .gage beauty you have a chance to get in , nice .alright leading one nothing .but this is a great practice .look at that little chip and run , instead of using a wedge .alright , you hit a little behind that one. [CLS] [SEP]but i like that shot. [CLS] [SEP]and boys just for a little education. [CLS] [SEP], that shot was used the first five hundred years of golf in scotland and ireland when the ground was really hard , but that 's a shot that i feel that you have to practice .and you have to practice to learn also .the chip and run .kids and golf .
in this clip we 're going to show that you can thrust with the sabre , as well as cut with the sabre .you defend the same way and you always attack yourself after you 've made your defense .it 's very important to do that , because most of the time the attacker will continue and hit , and if you do n't make that attack you wo n't get your point .now , we 're going to demo .you 're ready to demonstrate this ?okay .now he 's in his guard position ,right ?i 'm going to cut .ah !he 's using that blocking , which is not effective .it 's only effective if you 're real good .the thing about sabre , and a thing about any weapon in terms of fencing is that everybody thinks they know the easy way to do things , but they 're really doing it the hard way .so you have to listen to your coach .do it the way they teach you to do it .then , later you can modify it to your own taste .understand that ?give me twenty .ah , ha ha ha !see ?i. [CLS] [SEP]see ?i scored because he did n't understand it .there you go .now , he learned to do it .now , thrust .see ?you can score with a point .watch , and , and , yes !so , he blocked it , but he still used that funny block .come right across .there you go .that 's right .that 's right .now he blocked it , and , and did his cut .see , i 'm trying to cut .go .oh , no ! again .there .again .that 's right .see , i 'm trying to cut , but he cuts me very early , and by the time i get my blade on him. [CLS] [SEP]it 's too late .that time interval is very important , and you have to experiment with it because that 's what makes this game exciting .
i 'm going to talk to you about how to survive a kitchen remodel .and one thing to keep in mind that when you remodel your kitchen or any remodeling job in your house , usually it takes a little bit longer than what you plan it to .so always keep that in mind when you take your first approach .now in surviving a kitchen remodel the better plan that you do on the front end , then the better it 's going to go as you go through the process .now first thing is that when you actually get in to the remodel you want to try to isolate your room as much as you can by hanging plastic over all the openings so that you can limit any dust and debris from demolition within the kitchen area that you 're working with .now also you have to keep in mind that as you go through certain stages , particularly when you 're replacing cabinet , replacing appliances , that you 're going to be without this area to use for a while .so , you may want to work with your contractor to set up a temporary location for perhaps a range , your refrigerator , so that you can still have use of those items even while you 're waiting for the new ones to be installed .now most ranges require special electrical. [CLS] [SEP]so that is something that 's going to have to be taken in to consideration when you do that .the things that you want to do is when you 're working with your contractor. [CLS] [SEP]make sure that you have a contract in place that specifies exactly what they 're going to be doing. [CLS] [SEP]and then you also want to make sure you 've got well established work hours. [CLS] [SEP]so you know when the contractors are going to set up , what time they 're going to be working and when they 're going to be completing each day .so as you do that and as you keep in mind that as you go through different aspects , you 're going to have to plan ahead. [CLS] [SEP]so plan ahead for since this is the area. [CLS] [SEP]where your meals are prepared you may need to prepare some meals in advance , you may need to plan on a few nights out or actually eating with friends .but if you work with your contractor and your professionals you can get a pretty good idea how long these remodels will last and just as long with proper planning and to make sure you put some things in place , then you should be able to get through those kitchen remodels. [CLS] [SEP]o.k .so i 'm tim gipson and that 's how to survive a kitchen remodel .
: here are some different glaze examples of the pieces we have in pottery .you can see how the glazes change over the different clay bodies themselves .we have a white clay , our throwing clay , a sculpture clay and then two different slips , our black slip and white slip with the rutile gold over the top of it .there are lots of other surfaces here with different glazes ; different results to highlight whatever kind of design that you put onto your piece .here , i have two of the finished platters that i 've made .this is a black glaze that i 've put on here and here 's another platter with the shino glaze on top of it where we 're highlighting that spiral that we put in our pot earlier .so there 's all different kinds of surfaces , all different kinds of glazes to put on there .
now that you 've got your gear and ready to snowboard you need to have a good time out here and get from point a to point b on your snowboard , which i 'm going to be explaining to you .you need to learn a little bit about the bindings and the chair lift ; just all around getting up and down the mountain and having a good time with it .before i teach you how to strap in your bindings you definitely need to take a look at the mountain and know what 's around you .know what you need to stay clear of .know where the jumps are , the rails are .where there 's a lot of traffic flow .maybe if you 're not so confident in hitting the jumps and hitting the stuff you can go off to the side and take a nice run off the side of the mountain .instead of running into people and getting involved in everyone around you .just take a smooth run by yourself and get to know the feel of the mountain .
a circle is always a really good , a circle is very common in logos , it just has a nice smooth fill .well instead of making an actual boarder , i went to the layers. [CLS] [SEP]and i just added a glow , an outer glow .so what i did is i cut out the background. [CLS] [SEP]and then i created an outer glow .now , on the inside i have many , many layers here. [CLS] [SEP]and it does n't look like it because it blends all in .if you notice right in here , there 's a slight texturization .well actually where the texture came from was a picture of a crowd of people. [CLS] [SEP]and i had taken it on a concert. [CLS] [SEP]i 've gone to. [CLS] [SEP]and so anyway i just put it. [CLS] [SEP]so lightly you can literally not even tell unless you just really , really went in .but even then you really can not tell .see this use to be the face of a person , but what i did is. [CLS] [SEP]i went back. [CLS] [SEP]and i put a filter , a dry brush i believe with maybe a paint filter on it too .i just combined a few filters , so i took a picture , a photograph that i had made to create the background .
so you want to remove some facial hair .a lot of the areas that are involved in this process are your lip , usually your sideburns or your cheek or your fuzzy , a lot of women have extra fuzzy stuff that they do n't want to deal with and then some chin hair .sometimes there are one or two , sometimes it 's enough to wax .so you need to decide , do you want to do this , do you have enough hair that you want to wax or do you just want to use tweezers and a mirror ?do you want to invest in the , if you just have a few hairs , then you probably just want to use a tweezer and a mirror .if you have enough hair , then you probably want to invest in a wax , whether you choose to do a hard wax or a soft wax , you need to invest in that .and then there are several products that are involved in that investment and some upkeep. [CLS] [SEP]and so you 'll need to decide. [CLS] [SEP], are you going to wax these areas , and it usually should last two weeks or so or are you going to tweeze them and just worry about checking on them every two or three days as the hair comes in .so you 've made this decision .are you going to tweeze or are you going to wax ?
we are going to do the half court diagonal game. [CLS] [SEP]and i am going to be on the back hand side .i am going to give gary a drop shot or a boast. [CLS] [SEP]so he has to learn to watch what i am going to do .he ca n't guess because if he guesses i am going to do a drop shot. [CLS] [SEP]he 'll hit a boast. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'll catch the wrong footing. [CLS] [SEP]and i have to be ready for the shot because he can hit a lot of power off the. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's a good drill for both players .he learns to cover the front court. [CLS] [SEP]and i learn to do a little deception in the touch shots .that 's very tough .gary hit that ball very tight and it is very hard to do anything with and that was a pretty good drop. [CLS] [SEP]so i am working him now. [CLS] [SEP]but he gave a tight ball. [CLS] [SEP]so when he hits it real tight it is hard to do anything off of it .good shot , gary .so that ball is a little high. [CLS] [SEP]and i got a good boast. [CLS] [SEP], good drop shot , i can work him now , so i hit a boast. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's a great shot out of the net. [CLS] [SEP]so this drill is very very important for both players because you work on the various parts of the game here without over doing it. [CLS] [SEP]so add this drill to your repertoire and you will see vast improvement in your court coverage and your deception .
this cocktail is called the breathalizer .this is one of those things that would be good after dinner if you did n't have peppermints on you or did n't have gum on you. [CLS] [SEP]and you wanted one more cocktail .be careful because it is all liquor .go ahead and put your ice in your glass , like so .then we 're going to do one ounce of peppermint schnapps .one ounce of peppermint , now this is just like , you can use like a generic peppermint schnapps , that 's fine .rumpleminze is also a peppermint schnapps and that 's 100 proof .so , my advice there is to be careful .one ounce of light rum , there we go .mix it together .easy right ?one ounce or peppermint schnapps , one ounce of light rum .here 's your cocktail glass .you can either strain this as a shot , you can do it also as a martini , which is mine to manage just a big shot , or you can do it as a cocktail .this is what it looks like as a cocktail .go on and garnish this with a garnish straw. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's your breathalizer .cheers .
now we 're going to do a review of just cleaning the record .you know , this could use a cleaning , let 's clean it .pull out my record , pop off my record cleaner , give it a couple good sprays .i 've got my cleaning. [CLS] [SEP]medium right here , i 'm just cleaning the part on the outside here that actually holds the music ; i 'm not concerned with the inside .it 's already looking better .but when i 'm drying it i do want to make sure i dry the inside. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm trying to be careful and not to touch the inside because i really might take some off .but i 'm keeping this pretty dry .i 'm going to get rid of this old sleeve that i 'm sure has dirt in it .throw in a new sleeve , though i only did one side , normally i 'd be doing both sides .store it. [CLS] [SEP]so the record 's not going to fall out .and i 'm going to put it down below .
for our cake today , i used a special doll mold cake , that you can get in a cake decorating store or craft store .and , but i recommend , that instead of just using the doll cake , they tell you to put enough batter for a two layer cake , i recommend also making a ten or a nine inch round layer cake .what happens when you fill these molds , it domes up. [CLS] [SEP]and then you want to trim that dome off .so you 'll need the extra layer cake to give you the height for the barbie .so , if you do n't have a doll mold cake like that , a doll cake mold like that , you can use something like this , a bundt , a small bundt pan , or even an oven-safe bowl .and then , with the additional layer cake , that will give you the height that you need .
so here is our second sock with the snout cut out of it .and so out of this sock we are going to cut two arms and a tail and. [CLS] [SEP]some ears if we want some ears .so at this point you just make a decision .do you like a monkey with long arms or do you like a monkey with a long tail ?i mean they are about the same length but. [CLS] [SEP]the part that goes from the heel to the toe is a little bit shorter than the part that goes from the heel to the top of the sock .so if you want long arms take the arms out of here and you will take the tail out of this part .if you prefer a long tail and slightly shorter arms do it the other way around .i like. [CLS] [SEP], i think today i am going to do long arms .so what i am going to do is just kind of basically going to cut this off over here .just go ahead and square this off kind of where we took the snout out of .and kind of these socks of these socks are kind of grabbing the scissors. [CLS] [SEP]but there we go ,okay .so i squared that off and now we got to get both arms out of this .so what i am going to do. [CLS] [SEP]is i need to cut this down the middle and then each one will sew up into a tube into an arm .but similar to the way we did the legs i am not going to just slice through this .i am going to do it one side. [CLS] [SEP]then i am going to do the other .so i am going to make two separate cuts just too kind of you know kind of keep it about even and some what symmetrical .and so here i am just kind of cutting down .i. [CLS] [SEP]just like i say i want to make two pieces here each of which will be sewn into a little tube to become a sock monkey arm extraordinary .okay here we go .and this cut is almost finished .yeah. [CLS] [SEP]okay .and you flip it and same thing .let 's see i just kind of use the creases from the sock .you know if you make these from old socks. [CLS] [SEP]you are not really necessarily going to have the creases to help you out. [CLS] [SEP]but just eyeball it .and if you want to i mean if you are not really good at eyeballing things , i am because i am a carpenter 's daughter and he eyeballs things all the time .you kind of do it that way .but if you have a hard time eyeballing it just make a little mark on there with a felt tip pen. [CLS] [SEP]or you know just something so that you even draw a line with a ruler if you need to kind of get that guideline .so i am just kind of you know cutting straight trying to make two pretty close to equivalent halves here .just got a little bit more to go .and a couple more cuts .and like and other project in sewing it does n't matter if the edges are rough because they are going to get. [CLS] [SEP]you know you know folded under and hemmed up anyways .there we go .so here are the arms .let 's just kind of go back to assembly and see what it looks like .body , but , legs and snout will be here. [CLS] [SEP]and then the arms usually put the white part outwards. [CLS] [SEP]cause it 's like the hands of the monkey. [CLS] [SEP]and so they will kind of go like that .so we still need to cut a tail and some ears .
here we 're going to discuss a minor third interval , where we take the major scale and we go from the first note up a whole step , up another whole step to the third note of a major scale .now , a minor third refers to taking this third note and lowering it by a half step , the same way we lowered the second down to a minor second .so , we 've got the first note , the second note , the third note of a major scale .bring it down one for a minor third .now , anywhere on the neck , if you play one note and you go up three frets , that would be referred to as a minor third interval .now , you can also do that between two strings .you could start on this note and go , instead of here. [CLS] [SEP], you could play this note five fret back , right here .so , you could also play a minor third now on two separate strings .just remember , when you get to the b string , this will always work until you get to the b string .when you hit the b string , raise that interval shape up by one fret to make that interval the same .
another element of your home office that could easily be overlooked .most rooms , home offices , in someone 's house , apartment or condo is only going to have. [CLS] [SEP]one or two power supplies just built into the walls .you want to make sure that you go out and purchase an adequate number of power strips as well as surge protectors .you do n't want to be overloading your sockets , starting a fire or blacking-out the entire floor of your building because you put six different appliances into two different plugs .also , it 's important that when you 're setting up your power supplies you want to know where all of your equipment is going to be so that you 're not investing a lot of extra money wasting it on power cords , extension cords , things of that nature .also , you want to make sure that certain appliances , certain pieces of hardware -- they 're always going to be in one spot like your monitors , like your tower and any external monitors , that they go on to the same power strip .a big problem you 'll find when you 're putting together your home studio for the first time , beginner 's mistake , is to just plug anything into any socket wherever it goes .quickly that 'll lead to a bird 's nest of wires where you ca n't find anything if you have to unplug one thing .that can be time consuming and become very irritating very quickly .
so , now i 'm going to be showing you how to do , legs up the wall .it 's a variation , and a more restorative pose of shoulder stand for women in their first trimester of pregnancy .often , during pregnancy , particularly in the first trimester , you do n't want to practice any inverted poses , like head stand or hand stand .but this is a softer variation of an inversion , where you 're not lifting the hips above the belly .where you 're doing , is you 're just leaning the legs against the wall .so , go ahead and come onto your sticky mat , have a nice solid wall or mirror , or something nearby that you can brace yourself up against .and bring you right hip to the wall .go ahead , and come on to your back , as you swing your hips around , and draw the legs up the wall .if you need to , you can re-adjust , and walk the hips closer to the wall , and then separate the legs , as wide as feels comfortable .draw the arms down by the side , the palms facing up , and start to breath nice and deeply , from the belly , all the way up to the tops of the lungs .drawing your legs up the wall , allows gravity to help your veins pump all that wonderful blood back to the heart , allowing the heart to distribute oxygen back out to the rest of the body .it also helps to calm the nervous system .it 's a wonderful pose to do before you go to bed at night .and , just make sure you allow everything to soften here .try to do more , by doing less in this pose .and this is also a wonderful pose that helps circulation in the lower extremities , so just see if you can breathe deeply .and , this is a wonderful pose that you can do , after your first trimester , in your second and third trimester , with something that props up your back , so you 're more in the position of a v.but , it 's a nice way to give the feet and the ankles , and the legs a break .when you 've stayed in the pose for a minute or so , breathing deeply , and you 're ready to come out , go ahead and bend the knees .and you 're going to go ahead and drop the knees , back to one side , maybe walking the knees down the wall , and just take a moment , in the fetal position , on your side , and take a few breaths there , and when you 're ready , go ahead , and press yourself up to a nice soft cross legged position .and that is legs up the wall , for women in their first trimester of pregnancy .
so we are going to have to make a substitute for it .what you need is regular milk and vinegar .we are going to take out measuring cup. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to put in 2 teaspoons of vinegar .the recipe calls for 1 cup of buttermilk but for high altitudes , they say to do 1 1/4 .with the vinegar in there , we are just going to add the rest until it is 1 1/4 cups .all right now that we have our buttermilk made , we are going to add the flour , salt and baking soda alternately with the milk .now we are going to put the flour in .the recipe calls for 2 /2 cups but for high altitudes we are only going to use 2 1/4 cups .we 'll dump that in. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to pour in a little bit of the buttermilk. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to mix that up .now we are going to add the baking soda and the recipe calls for 1 teaspoon. [CLS] [SEP]so we 'll put that in. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to put a little bit more of the buttermilk and mix it up again .again , we are going to scrape the sides to make sure tghat everything gets mixed it .now i am going to add 1 teaspoon of vanilla .now we are going to add the last ingredient of salt .the recipe calls for 1/2 teaspoon of salt .i 've added 1/2 teaspoon of salt and the rest of the buttermilk and i am going to finish mixing it up .always remember to scrape the sides because you do n't want to miss any of the good stuff .
thus far our painting has been broad , broad brush strokes .but , now we 're going to shift gears and go down to the detail side of the painting .and that 's going to be with a very small round brush which we 're going to fill in these dog tags .every doggie should have them .this is very much more in terms of finesse detail work than the things we 've done so far .try to make that your painting stays in the basic shape of the circular object here .it does not have to be perfect , but you should n't have big squiggles going out over the gray , either .continue to apply this around and then once you 've filled this in. [CLS] [SEP]we 're then going to take the same brush and apply some radiant lemon to it .with this radiant lemon we 're going to go around the outside .what does this do ?it makes the tag more interesting in terms of there being a double light source , for starters .after you 've applied the radiant lemon , again , with the same brush , take some burnt sienna and we 're going to use the burnt sienna as the little metal fixture here .if the paint 's too dry just apply a little bit of media .these are a bunch of little brushes that will make a big difference later on .we 're painting these in now because the fur is going to be coming out towards the viewer in tufts and curls and it will partially hide these dog tags .
today we 're going to be doing what 's called knitting backwards .this is a really fun technique because normally when we were doing a stockinet stitch , which is what this is , we would knit down to the end of the row and then we would turn our work and purl back .with knitting backwards we 're going to be purling but from the right side .so you won ?t be turning your knit work over to accomplish your purl .i 've knit down to the end of this row. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm not going to flip my work .now i 'm going to insert my needle from the back , loop my yarn around and pull it through .this is a really fun technique to learn .and it gets very efficient .whoops .catch that stitch .and we go in the back , loop our yarn around and pull it through .insert the needle into the back of the stitch .yarn comes from back to front and pop your old stitch off .and you can see i have n't had to turn my work around to accomplish my purl row .this is a lot of fun to do and really can be a wonderful thing to do if you 're doing fair aisle or you 're doing intarsia .this makes it a lot easier because you 're viewing your front side all the time that you 're working .and that 's how you knit backwards .
right now we 're going to be learning an exercise for the finger vibrato and again i want you to put down your bow and just take your violin .you 'll find that it 's somewhat similar to the hand vibrato exercise except this one and your finger. [CLS] [SEP]vibrato. [CLS] [SEP]it 's really just your fingers that are moving .so you want to practice doing that kind of stretch in , up like that and down. [CLS] [SEP]and you want your finger to kind of go in this box shape and then straighten out because when you actually start doing your finger vibrato you 're going to be moving like this .so your finger is going to be very , very loose. [CLS] [SEP]so just like your hand needs to be loose and your arm needs to be loose for those type of vibratos .for the finger vibrato you really have to practice having your finger move because a , you wo n't be able to do the finger. [CLS] [SEP]vibrato if your fingers are too stiff .so you just want to practice that so that you can loosen them up and. [CLS] [SEP]eventually you 'll get to a point where you 're going to be able to kind of vibrate like this .but for now just doing this basic exercise will help you get started .
in this video , i 'm going to be talking about what i call the horizontal hop .now to do this you have to be pretty good at doing the horizontal circles , like this , and you have to have at least tried doing a throw , like that .a horizontal throw , and back into horizontal circles .something like that .so you need to be pretty good at both of those .now , i 'll just show you what the horizontal hop looks like first , and then we can start talking about it .that 's what it looks like .let 's see if we can get a longer run .something like that .so what 's actually happening , is i 'm getting a horizontal spin going like this , as fast as i can , and then i 'm just hopping the stick from the very center of the crystal stick straight up and down , with short little throws , so that the tassels can spin. [CLS] [SEP]passed my hands , and i can keep the spin going , like that .those are what horizontal hops look like .now to practice this , you 'll want to just , again , go into a fast horizontal spin , place your control stick in the very central of the crystal stick , the very center of the crystal stick , i should say , and just try and get that quick hop down .now , the stick will obviously slow down as you keep going , but you can just go back into the ticktock pattern , go back to your horizontal circles , and keep going .
as we talked about a little bit earlier the demi sec. [CLS] [SEP]the sec champagnes are a little sweeter even the extra dry champagnes , go really well with. [CLS] [SEP]desserts believe it or not .so but for me there 's a different types of descriptions of champagne some of the real dry one that are even described as steely. [CLS] [SEP], you get a nice just a real bite to it off of your tongue .some of them have a little more sweetness to it but still dry and those are my favorites. [CLS] [SEP]so it goes so well with the seafoods and all. [CLS] [SEP]and this is a perfect example of one ,a little pin point bubbles. [CLS] [SEP]you can bring it into your nose just like a regular glass of wine .and get. [CLS] [SEP]that nice nice smell and the flavor savor. [CLS] [SEP]that into your mouth and just imagine that with some great lobster or this even stands up to beef dishes or pork dishes .this is a wonderful thing that should n't be just a treat on special occasions you should be able to have this anytime you like .so remember not all sparkling wines and champagnes but all champagne is sparkling wine just enjoy .
hey let 's talk about testing your gear .there is a lot of gear you need to do bike touring effectively .you will have a bike that is loaded down with a lot of gear , you will probably have a front rack like this , you know , a handle bar bag , and rear bags. [CLS] [SEP]so you 'll be pretty loaded down .what is important is that when you get that bike and you get those bags that you do n't make the tour the first time you use them .go out , get this gear well in advance of your tour , and put it all on your bike and load up and do some loaded rides .and this will give you a sense of the sensation of what your loaded bike is going to handle like and also make sure that everything is kind of together and. [CLS] [SEP]in the state it needs to be in .last year i used a front rack on a tour for the first time ever .i had mostly done really light tours and tried to keep it as light as possible .so i had only used rear backs. [CLS] [SEP]but i put a front back on. [CLS] [SEP]and i went out and tested it. [CLS] [SEP]and unfortunately the thing broke. [CLS] [SEP]and i went up and over the handlebars at a reasonably high rate of speed .and so it was n't a good experience. [CLS] [SEP]but it did prevent that from happening far from civilization .i was near my home town. [CLS] [SEP], i had my wife come pick me up and did some repairs to the bike and got everything going in such a way that that would n't happen again .other things is to make sure that your bike is going to work well with weight on it , that you have got the right tire set up , that you are not going to have any other mechanical problems .so just make sure that you do some shake down cruises to make sure that your bike is running well and that you do n't have these problems happen when you are far far away from the nearest town , you know , you do n't want to be in that kind of world of hurt .so get your gear together , get it on the bike and go ride around and make sure that everything is functioning properly before you go out and actually turn that first pedal on that big tour .
so when you see that you 've done something incorrectly in a barrel run or if you watch a tape of yourself doing something incorrectly , use that as a learning tool but try not to beat yourself up with it and just move on .so then next thing you want to do then instead of focusing on that mistake is focusing on what you are going to do correctly instead .so instead of focusing on the mistake focus on what the correction would be .so instead of going through and saying okay. [CLS] [SEP]my horse keeps ducking at the second barrel , if you focus on that your horse will continue to duck the second barrel but instead if you focus on , i 'm going to drive my horse right up into the pocket with my left foot and keep driving him across the arena. [CLS] [SEP]then that is exactly what you are going to do .so what i like to do the night before a barrel race and moments before a barrel race is to go through the pattern in my head seeing myself running that pattern perfectly .does n't mean i 'm going to run the pattern perfectly every time. [CLS] [SEP]but what it does is it sets me up for success .it tells my muscles what to do. [CLS] [SEP]so my muscles in my mind have already practiced that correctly and they 're going to tell my body what to do correctly once i get out in the arena .
ok let 's play the bass drum on beats one , two , the and of two , the and of three and the and of four under the rock beat .ok let 's break this down to get a better idea of what 's going on with the bass drum .i like to think of this beat splitting it in two ways .first of all playing the bass drum on one and two , simple enough .and then after the second beat we switch to the off. [CLS] [SEP]beat on the bass drum between the hi hat strokes .so two on the beat. [CLS] [SEP]and then switch directly off the beat .
we do n't want to teach first aid today .no , no , we 're taking about monster toast .so , when it 's cooking actually before you push it on , i actually take the toaster oven and put it back on the shelf away from the kids .it also has the element of surprise , because you like to have the finished product as a nice surprise .and when it 's too close , kids are curious .they 're going to be touching the glass , touching the top , they move around , and you do n't want to worry about it .i do n't know how much your liability insurance is , but you do n't want to tap into it .so , move your toaster oven out of the way .okay , the other thing , too , this is a good time for the clean up .yes , it 's another teachable moment , cleaning up .when you have all these things on the table , you 're going to want to clear the table .so , tell the kids , `` hey !now it 's time to clean up .let 's see who can follow directions . [CLS] [SEP]''name a student .have him say , `` john , i want you to take two paper plates to the trash . [CLS] [SEP]''and he 'll take two .so , now you 've got number concept and a following direction .sometimes you could make a time clean up , where you put on a little timer and give them two minutes , `` let 's see how fast we could do it . [CLS] [SEP]''now , you 're working with food coloring , so this might not be the one to a timed clean up with , but teaching clean up shows children closure .it helps them go from one activity to the beginning of another activity .so , cleaning up is important , and , of course , you 'll going to like that skill for later on .so , now , that we 're cleaned up , the toast is cooking , we 're ready for the next step .
our next step is going to be to set this router up to make a 1/4 of an inch deep cut .i have the router set at 0. [CLS] [SEP]and i do that by pushing it down until the straight bit contacts a flat surface , like the table , then i lock the carriage in place and adjust these two nuts down like this .if you have one of these plunge routers. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm sure that you already know how to do that .so we 've got it set at 0. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'm going to take and set my depth gage at 0 as well and then raise it 1/4 of an inch ,right about there .now you have to wear eye protection when you 're working with a router .i like to wear these .i got these at a little craft store and they double as eye protection as well .they enclose your eyes from the side which is good also they do n't fall off like glasses and you can flip them up right out of the way .handy dandy little item .
alright we 're talking about the canon 40d again , and we 're moving from the basic modes to the more advanced operation modes of the camera .canon kind of has separated most of the modes into two areas .one is the basic zone which is on the lower half of this dial here .most of these basic zones have an icon that is , looks very different from the creative zone modes .the creative zone is indicated by letters for the most part .the creative zone includes a program mode which automatically sets your exposure settings with iso speed , aperture and shutter speed , but a lot of other options that were n't available , available to you in the basic zone are now available to you in the program mode .the next mode is the shutter priority mode. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's indicated by a t , upper case t and a lower case v. [CLS] [SEP]the shutter priority mode. [CLS] [SEP]is , just gives you the option to set the shutter speed manually and then the aperture is set automatically based on what the camera thinks would be a good exposure , and. [CLS] [SEP]then the next mode is the aperture priority , or a , lower case b.this mode gives you the control to manually set the aperture and then the exposure for the shutter speed will automatically be set , and the final mode is .there are two more modes .the next mode here is the manual mode , and this mode allows you to set both the aperture and the shutter , shutter speed according to your needs .the very last mode here that we have in the creative zone is the automatic depth of field mode , and that mode will look at all of the objects on the focusing points in your finder sensor and set the exposure settings in order to give you the optimum depth of field for all of those subjects to be in focus .one thing you 'll need to do before operating in these creative modes is make sure that you set your on/off switch all the way up to activate this quick control dial .once you flip that all the way up there 's a little line pointing up to your quick control dial .once the quick control switch is flipped all the way up to make that quick control dial active , you 'll have control over all of the settings that you , that you would want to have control over in these creative zones .
so when your pasta garland has already dried , then it 's time to put it on the christmas tree .let 's find maybe a place here .and then you just hang it over like that .it will be a lovely decoration .and of course , if you have a longer one , you can put it all around your christmas tree and that will be beautiful .why is it good fun ?because if you have a little bit older children , you can make the christmas garland all together because it 's a good preparation for the children .they really look forward to christmas and it would be very nice for them to make a christmas decoration or to make a christmas garland that you can actually put on the christmas tree so they can wonder at it all around christmas .as they get older , you can see the improvement throughout the years .obviously , they want to make the same christmas decoration at the age of three that they 'll make at the age of 12.and it 's a nice way of showing it on your christmas tree and put all the decorations around it .they can also surprise you , and also while you are busy in the kitchen making the christmas lunch or christmas dinner , you can occupy your children with this easy-going task .obviously , do n't give the sharp needle for your child because they can hurt themselves .but they can easily use the paint .they can easily use the wool .they can easily use the pasta .they are not dangerous at all .of course , some supervision is important here , but if you supply them with a place where they can make a mess , then it 's not a real problem .and it 's a good free time activity before christmas .you can just sit down , listen to some christmas music and christmas songs , christmas carols , and then you can do your own art .so have a merry christmas .
alright , and now that you 're comfortable spinning your poi backwards with each hand , let 's put them together and spin them both backwards .again , like with the front , we 're keeping the poi rotating both at the same speed , and parallel to each other .this is actually a little bit easier than it , or it 's a little bit harder than it looks .but , if you are having troubles with this at first , do n't be discouraged , just keep practicing and you will see that you will improve very quickly to be able to do this .and , notice if you feel more comfortable spinning them forwards , or backwards , some people feel more comfortable spinning them backwards , and find it more challenging to spin them forwards , and other people vise-versa .while most people feel most comfortable holding the hands at waist level , you can also start experimenting with rotating your arms at different heights .
in this clip we 're going to do backside 180s .so , if you 've never done a backside 180 , start some place small like do them off of a roller or on flat ground .and then you can step up to like jumps or the sides of rails , or we 're going to hit this right here. [CLS] [SEP], this is a nice , easy mellow transition on the side of this jump .so , is what you 're going to do is when you drop in , do n't go too fast 'cause you 'll overshoot the landing if you 're not used to it .so , when you come in , just come in straight. [CLS] [SEP], stay on your toe side .so , when you back seven here. [CLS] [SEP]you 're going to be up on your toes .after you pop an ollie , you 're going to turn your shoulders , and it 's all in your shoulders ; shoulders and head .so , wherever you look , that 's where your body is going to go .so , drop in , look up at the top of the lip there , you 're going to pop an ollie , turn your shoulders , keep your knee sucked up , keep looking to where you want to land. [CLS] [SEP]and when you stop at the 180 drop your feet and ride away clean .
ok , covering the court with one step , i want to be able to get to the back of the front-court , the mid-court , and the front of the back-court .so , if i 'm under extreme pressure , i do n't have time to really do anything except step and react .so , this type of movement drill , i want you to practice this. [CLS] [SEP], you 're right here , you just lunge and get the ball .so , if somebody hit a big shot , all i do , all i can do is have time to just put my racket on it , and with enough practice i might be able to hit something decent out of it .if the ball comes to the mid-court , i want you just to learn to step like that quickly , or you can even go an open stance .in this situation , sometimes you can hit a good lob , or a cone or drop , or pop the ball back , but you 're not going to get a lot of pace on it , because you 're under a lot of pressure with an open stance .and , then you 've got to go into the back court , so you might go like this , trying to just get the ball back .you 're under pressure , you 're not going to win this point on this shot , most likely , but you 've got to keep the point going .so , you want to either go with this foot and hit it , or you 're just going to go back and probably boast it , but you might be able to do something else if you get a good body turn .so , what i want you to practice at home or on the court. [CLS] [SEP]is just a one step shot. [CLS] [SEP], you 're just going to lunge , just like that .so , really pretend that the ball is coming to you and make it real so when you get under pressure , you 'll be able to hit this shot .but , being able to cover a large amount of the court with one step is very valuable .
right now we 're going to do a painting of a windmill .it 's probably in a mediterranean country .it 's got some warm colors in it and the paints we 're going to use are going to be primary red , which is basically naphthol red or cadmium red .we could even use permanent rose , which is a darker red .cobalt blue and yellow .plus we 'll need pane 's gray as well .brushes .we 're going to need like a number ten brush with a fine point on it .it needs to have a fine point .when you wet it , it needs to come to a sharp point like this .and this one is synthetic and natural kolinsky red sable .you can use anything from a size six round to a size fourteen , but i think a ten is the right size for this painting which is going to be six by nine .
stepping back with the left foot , bringing the arms overhead , warrior i has .give yourself enough room in your stance ; your right and left foot hipbone distance apart , so you can get the hips to square towards the front of the room .that 's key .if your heels are too lined up towards each other or in the same plane , and your hips tend to get squished in the sacrum .exhale into warrior ii , arms extending .a nice balance here of muscle energy with a releasing outward of the heart energy .so hugging to center line , yes , but also letting go of some of that tension and stress , especially in the shoulders , and letting the arms lengthen .now come , now straighten out the right leg ; turn all ten toes towards the side wall , and then go into warrior ii , same side , or opposite side , so the left knee is bending , right outer edge of the foot pressing into the floor , beautiful .and then into warrior. [CLS] [SEP]i , so again , you 're going to separate the heels just a little bit , i like that .heel toeing the foot towards the opposite side of the mat to bring your hips square , nice .it also helps to bring the back foot at a forty five , and then lift the heart energy up towards the sky , nice .you could even take your gaze upward , very excellent .
and we 've tenderized them. [CLS] [SEP]so now we 've got to get ready to fry them .we have all of the ingredients right here we need to dip them in , in order to get them ready to fry. [CLS] [SEP]but we are going to be frying these as we go. [CLS] [SEP]so we need to get the oil ready for frying .you want to put them directly into the frying pan. [CLS] [SEP]so we are going to go ahead and put the batter on there and from the batter , we are putting them directly into the frying pan .usually when you are making schnitzels , you are making a whole bunch of them .so as you can see you are going to have them all ready. [CLS] [SEP]and then you are going to make them as you go .for today 's purposes , we are going to be using olive oil .traditionally in german cooking , you usually use butter to make schnitzels but you know that is a lot of fat and that is not really healthy .i personally like using olive oil .it is a lot healthier and to tell you the truth it really gives it a better taste .for today 's purposes , i am using olive oil where i have some herbs in there. [CLS] [SEP]and so it gives it some additional flavor .what you want to do with the oil. [CLS] [SEP]is you basically want to pour it into the pan. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to cover the whole bottom of the pan .you have to be really generous with this oil .you do n't want to put too little in there because the schnitzels are going to sop up quite a bit of that oil .now do n't worry if you do n't have enough in there because as you are making them , you can always put more oil in .but the one thing that you want to make sure of is the oil is not smoking then you know that it is too hot and the schnitzel are only going to be cooked for maybe a minute and half on each side because they are really thin , so they are going to cook pretty fast .okay , so we have the bottom covered here .we are going to turn the heat up to about medium high. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to get that oil nice and hot. [CLS] [SEP]so what good rule of thumb i like to use. [CLS] [SEP]is. [CLS] [SEP]i take a pinch of bread. [CLS] [SEP]crumbs. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'll wait for the oil to heat up. [CLS] [SEP]and then i will go ahead and throw some bread. [CLS] [SEP]crumbs in there .if the bread crumbs already start frying , then i know that the oil is hot enough and this is how we prepare the skillet to get ready to make wiener schnitzels .
now we are talking about the burmese hand and joint used together .the beginner very easy one is up , see my elbow. [CLS] [SEP]or i start using my elbow , it ’ s not only there the hands but also your elbow .then it ’ s a closed one to wide one .now this time we need to talk about the head positions too .now when the hands is raised you have to look against the other side. [CLS] [SEP]so when you check the profile .now when i close together here this is very basic .now i teach you a little tricky ones .this is now in the movement and angles .
woman or girl ?almost the same as a man or boy .stars the same way .sometimes you can play around with the noses .here is a different kind of nose that what the man .give her a little bit of a neck .we will come down .the arms are the same .hair do any kind of hair you like .you always see little girls drawing hair that goes like this .whoop and whoop bump .that is the easiest , you do n't have to put the details in there if you do n't have time .coming down from the tops of the arms .kind of come in a little bit instead of going straight down .a waist and of course the designation of woman is dress .although you can draw your woman wearing whatever you like and show a little bit of that bottom .the ankles , shoes put a little bit of a heel on the shoe .a little detail on the dress .you can put a collar on the shirt .she is wearing a nice blouse .a little bit of button down .and there you have it .there is is woman and one last final touch some lipstick very easy , very cute .you can even put a little blush and here you go .girl just as easy .same exact thing .not going to let that girl wear high heals .she is too young .and she 's ready to go to school. [CLS] [SEP]all dressed all nice .you can give her a collar too even tough. [CLS] [SEP]she probably does n't want to play in those clothes and that 's it .
today we 're going to talk a little about iron stone. [CLS] [SEP]i just want to give a overview about iron stone. [CLS] [SEP]you 'll find many pieces from the 19th century and the 18th century .this is very typical iron stone piece. [CLS] [SEP]right here is just a blank white iron stone it comes in a. [CLS] [SEP]you 'll find it they use this type of iron stone in 19th century. [CLS] [SEP]and we 've talked a little bit about in different series .about iron stone the base for iron stone in flow blue they used a typical base like this. [CLS] [SEP]it 's a heavy weight iron stone .you 'll see it in flow blue in what we showed you in mulberry which is an iron stone base like this a heavy piece .you 'll see it in a light blue which we also showed you in the series and most of the transfer ware you 'll find earlier in mid 19th century is a heavy weight like this .so this is what we 're talking about here. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to show you a number of different examples not necessarily this plain white iron stone but different iron stones that are english and american .
i ’ m going to show you , on this particular monitor , how to setup for a particular type of workout .remember , you turn on the monitor on first of all , or just start puling .i ’ m going to do a workout that ’ s based on time .we ’ re going to do intervals .we ’ re going to press the time button. [CLS] [SEP]and you ’ re going to come up with a clock here .so whichever digit is flashing is the one that i can change using the up arrow .this particular workout ,i ’ m going to do 10 minute pieces .i changed what digit is flashing by pressing the side arrow .i want to get this number zero , so i press the up arrow to get it all the way back to zero , and i check that that ’ s the time i want to do .my workout is going to be 10-minute intervals .i ’ m going to take 3 minutes to rest in between each interval .this is the rest time , i rest the rest button after the 10 minutes was flashing .i ’ m going to do 3 minute intervals , so this digit is flashing .i ’ m going to press the up button until it says 3 minutes , and i ’ m ready to go .i just press ok.my screen shows that i ’ m going to be on for 10 minutes .as soon as the 10 minutes is over , it ’ s going to count down in this large gap here , the 3 minutes .as soon as that 3 minutes is over of my rest , i can drink some water , i can get up and stretch .this exact same screen is going to show .i can also , as we talked about before , scroll through to get different types of information as i ’ m doing that 10 minutes on .
and what actually is the best way to deal with a relationship breakup ?such input , you really need to get busy , you really need to deal with two things , the pride that you feel , the hurt and also the `` void '' in your life .the best thing to do is to take stock who you are as an individual , your inventory. [CLS] [SEP]your skills , your relationship skills and understand what you contributed and what you might not have contributed to the relationship which cause the breakup .and then from there , build up those relationship skills .fill in those gaps and therefore , the next time around , the next relationship , you 'll be much more positive contributor .so we 're building , we 're learning , we 're honing our skills .the next thing that we have to deal with is the `` void '' in our life .we spend , we probably spend friday , saturday nights , many times during the week with that particular someone .what do we do with that time ?spend it with our friends , family , those our co-workers , those that will support us .you do n't want to be clinging , but also , you just want to make sure that you 're engaging with enough people to help you get through the times where you maybe feeling bad or uncomfortable .i will suggest that you join association , there are professional associations , there are sports associations , all sorts of groups that you can attend with common interest .feel to get out there , meet , network and possibly meet somebody with common interest that you would enjoy , getting to know , which is the first step towards building the next relationship .so , feel good about yourself , filling that void in your life , build yourself up .you might want to attend a workshop , relationship workshop , marriage education classes , all these types of education , all good to help you better understand yourself and how you can be a positive contributor , so that you wo n't have to deal with that relationship breakup .i 'm joe cuenco , with family resources relationships for life .
so you want to start off with lengthen your spine , you 're going to lengthen through the crown of your head , no different than when you 're doing your standing poses , and you 're going to relax your shoulders .we 're going to use an inhale to extend your left leg up to the sky .and you 're probably going to start off with having a strap , or a rope , or take your husband 's tie .you want to be able to have ; i want you to be able to hold onto the loop , and not the tail .so the way that you 'll determine the size of your loop is the strap goes on the ball of your foot , and then you want to be able to have your arms straight , so that the weight of your hand is holding up your leg .so you 're not holding onto the strap and pulling , creating more tension in your shoulders than you 're releasing .you 're going to actively reach the heel as though it could touch the ceiling tile .
it 's where you 're looking at your crowd. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're trying to come up with something that makes sense. [CLS] [SEP]and you just ca n't .you 're --it 's almost. [CLS] [SEP]like you need to go , `` uh ! ''and you have this almost robotic `` i need to make a gesture . [CLS] [SEP]''and you do these horrible , stiff , very unnatural movements , just so that you feel like you 're doing a gesture .one of the best speakers i saw , and impacted me in such a way , basically , stood with his hand in his left pocket most of the evening and only spoke with one hand using it as an impactful gesture hand .and when he 'd maxed and used that hand , you always listen to that point .other than that , it dropped down to his side and , although he may be moving about the stage , he may be talking .unless there was a reason , something that needed to be impacted , that hand never moved from his side and this hand never left his pocket .
and mainly , a couple of reasons as far as how to prevent a toothache until you can see your general dentist. [CLS] [SEP]is you want to go ahead and purchase maybe some over-the-counter oral numbing medicine , and such as orajel .what that will do is you just place the gel on your gums , and on the tooth area where you 're having the ache from .that will numb the is , the area for a few minutes ; bout ' thirty to forty five minutes , and then then you would want to keep reapplying throughout the day .you also might want to go ahead and take some over-the-counter medication as far as like tylenol , advil , ibuprofen .advil or ibuprofen is best because it has a anti-inflammatory in it , which will help with any inflammation that you might have in that area .but until you can see your general dentist , those are the things you want to do , but you definitely do want to go see your dentist afterwards , so therefore , he would be able to determine what type of toothache you 're having ; if it 's a gum problem or if it 's an actual tooth problem , and he would be able to take care of it from there .once again , my name 's michelle , and. [CLS] [SEP]i just explained to you on how to prevent a toothache until you see your general dentist .
i 'll jump through one more time , once from each direction .
they 're impeccably dressed in bright , bold colors like red and yellow , much like hulk hogan .they usually arrive at a function a few minutes late ( iman the model ) , and it 's not that they ca n't tell time , they 've got a beautiful gold watch , they just want to make sure everybody notices when they walk in the room , and they 're not opposed to a drum roll flourish .both the men and the women have a feline quality to themselves , and they normally wear their hair swept back like a big lion 's mane , much like loni anderson and mae west .and some will go so far as to dress in animal prints , emulating their lion totem .they walk into the room like they own the joint , standing straight and tall like haile selassie .they are regal kings ( barack obama and napoleon ) and queens ( madonna ) of the zodiac .they truly believe that the sun is the center of the solar system , and since they are ruled by the sun , they think everybody in the world exists to orbit their star and to be darned grateful for the opportunity to do so .they throw the best temper tantrums in the zodiac ( danny bonaduce ) , while showing their displeasure , and they 'll punish you by removing their glowing presence from your life .so that 's how to spot a leo .it 's better living through astrology .i 'm janet sciales , the star goddess .
the line is just for a guideline to give you something to work from .okay , other piece of the mouth , coming off of here .see i got to work with my mouth here because i do n't have so much chin .if i had more chin. [CLS] [SEP]i can kind of bring my mouth down a little bit more .but since i do n't have that much chin , i got all this nice hair up here , i got to give this again the balance and the proper proportion. [CLS] [SEP]so it will work , it will look right .that is why i said to have a vision .you are not going to be perfect with the first one , getting still till you are all perfect .but you might have a critical eye like me. [CLS] [SEP]so it does n't work , go somewhere else with successful .maybe if i open that eye up , because of course i do n't have anything open yet .possibilities that it could stay closed , but more than likely it is going to be open because the more holes in the piece of wood the more like it has , the more spirit it has , the more expression , the more character it has .so i like to put the holes in it .but you can see i have established the lines .yeah , i can take off large pieces down there. [CLS] [SEP]cause. [CLS] [SEP]that is just the chin , they are not going to do nothing .just take right on off , just get all happy .you can even get a bigger chisel to take some of that stuff off .okay , that is because i got my line established underneath the mouth .now , with this , do i want to put my expression lines coming off the nose ?do i want to put my expression lines coming off the eye ?i vote for this one down here off the bottom of the mouth .you see that is when you start getting different kind , i did n't draw a line , but. [CLS] [SEP]i can already see a line there as far as expressions .
i have now played through new of b flat blues and gone through the chord progressions , outlines , and different chord .and shown how they are used in a common head and how to create a solo from them and tips to use a solo .i will now go through and play a traditional blues style playing the head and then also playing a solo and then playing the head again .so i will now play this using the chord changes on the piano .i hope you have learned some good ideas to play through a solo for the blues and that you had fun enjoying this .feel free to play over and transcribe any of the solos that i have used .here is freddy the freeloader and improvised solo .i hope you have enjoyed learning the blues in b flat on the flute .
so , decide what you can do well .decide what your staff is doing well .do n't try to do things that your staff is n't trained for , because you are going to burn yourself .sooner or later , somebody is going to complain about it and find out the staff was not qualified to do this .they just tried it and it does n't work .the other thing is monitoring attendance .if you monitor attendance properly and if you do n't act in a rash way ; if you do it over a period of time , you have a good idea. [CLS] [SEP]obviously what goes and what does n't go .if you have the same three people for three months , than you know you have stayed there too long .i usually give a season to decide what goes and not and work with those numbers and for next numbers .for next season , use that experience to decide what goes and what does n't go .
in this video segment series , we 're going to talk about blink 182 's `` adam 's song '' .let 's take a look at the guitar .we 're going to go over every part on this song. [CLS] [SEP]but before we can even start , if you want to play along with the cd , you 're going to have to tune your guitar differently .it 's not tuned to the centered e , a , d , g , b , e strings .each string is dropped a whole step .the finger positions that i 'll teach you will in normal centered tuning .but if you want to play along with the cd , you 're going to have to your low e down to a d note .you 'll have to turn your a string down to a g note .you 'll have to tune your d string down to a c note .you 'll have to tune your g string down to a f note .your b string down to a a note. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're high e string down to a d note .that would be , basically , standard tuning dropped a whole step .if you do n't have a tuner , do n't even bother , just go ahead and learn the positions and play along anyhow .once you 're done tuning your guitar , put your index finger on the second fret of the a string , your ring finger on the fourth fret of the d string .you 'll hit both of those in a row .then you 'll lift up your ring finger and hit the open d string .okay ?next , you 'll lift up your index finger and hit the open a string , but you 're going to answer the same way with the ring finger fourth fret and then open , like this .then , you 'll bring your middle finger down to the third fret of the low e string and answer in the same way .then the open e string , back to the third fret .the whole introduction sounds like this .( audio demo )in the next segment , we 're going to take a look at the verse for `` adam 's song '' .i 'll see you there .
first thing , the basic thing this whole part this piece of wood here , is called the body of the guitar .the wood that is attached to the body where you play , where you put your fingers down , this is the neck of the guitar .this part up here is called the head or headstock .this is your tail piece as you can see here. [CLS] [SEP]this is where the strings attach .this is your bridge , the strings will also sit into these little plastic things right here , and they are called saddles .these are your pickups if it 's an electric guitar that 's what translates the sound .these are your frets ; these metal things are your frets .these are your tuning pegs and this is called the nut .your strings will sit in those grooves right there too .
so before we continue with some of these ideas i 'll mention that most of the ideas we are looking at in these series focus on playing in four four or at least groups of twos and fours. [CLS] [SEP]but we can take it and mix up the high hat even further by playing either eighth note triplets or even sixteenth note triplets .so playing the sixteenth or eighth note triplets gives us a completely different feel than the feel of the three 's or the six 's and we can do that just for the sake of staying with one idea here. [CLS] [SEP], we 're going to go back to playing the high hat pattern based on four 's and based on the one e and uh counting .but certainly anything that we are doing here you could in some way do with either a three or a six on the high hat. [CLS] [SEP]so keep those ideas in mind and now we 'll be working on four four or groups of fours on the high hat .
basically , how to develop stage presence .so , right now we 've got one of our performers. [CLS] [SEP]right here , his name is johnny k.he 's working a program and this guy is going to be huge. [CLS] [SEP], you just watch , all right .so please come and take a seat and what we 're going to do is. [CLS] [SEP]just , we 're just going to go straight into it , just start your song .all right .do your favorite song .the one that maybe you get all the girls with .all the girls with ,huh ?yeah , the one that all the ladies like .just want to hear the chorus or something ?yeah ,wherever - the strongest part .'cause i love the way i feel whenever you 're standing here .and i love the way i know that you 're always going to be right here .do n't be shy come closer , let me see my baby .please me , hear my words , just say , please believe me , do n't leave me .all right johnny .smashing there , ai n't he got a good voice .all right .check this out now .i want to talk about the song , all right .now what type of a song is it ?let 's talk about the emotion of the song .what type of a song is it , is it up , is it down , is it sad , is it happy , what is it ?up .so it 's an up song , right. [CLS] [SEP], okay .so then , and that 's obvious , you hear it , you think of the lyrics , and as i said if that 's the first song , sometimes people wo n't even listen to the lyrics .they 're trying to get your deal out ,all right .but here 's the thing now. [CLS] [SEP], i can guarantee you a way that you can sell that song even more .you can sell that song and sell some serious cds .all right .on the other side , okay , we 're going to talk about how he can take this particular song , what 's it called ?do n't leave me .the song is called do n't leave me , and how they wo n't leave .they 're going to - he 's going to sell some serious amounts of. [CLS] [SEP]do n't leave songs , all over the place , all right .you do n't leave , come back on the other side , and we 're going to talk about how he can sell this song .
one k body shaping program. [CLS] [SEP]and i want to change the way you think about fitness .so you want to tone your calves .calves are very very difficult to produce results with because they are used since you were born .they have been used to propel you through life every single day in every activity you do .so they 're going to take a little bit more attention if you will .what i recommend is you have three ways of going about calves .you have obviously the straight up. [CLS] [SEP]and you have the one where your toes are touching. [CLS] [SEP]and then you have the one that is out like this. [CLS] [SEP]so what i do is every time i go to the gym if it is three days a week , four days a week , two days a week. [CLS] [SEP]whatever it is i do. [CLS] [SEP], i do my calves every time i go. [CLS] [SEP]and i rotate between the three positions .now if you do n't have a gym and you are maybe at home doing home programming. [CLS] [SEP]that 's fine too because you can still do this , this , and this on a stair .so all you have to do is hold on to the little rail that you 'll be walking upstairs and you can also do it on your stairs .if you do n't have stairs go out to the street , maybe you 'll start a little following in your neighborhood .you can do it on the curb .hold on to your mailbox .now that is pretty three simple ways to do it but again also whether i talked about doing it every time you go to the gym , you would in turn have to go out and maybe do 20 , 30 ,maybe 40 of those every time you pick up the mail .that might be pretty cool , just grab your mail , do 30 , 40reps and then walk in the house .just remember to rotate it around so you create that nice shape at the end of the day , alright ?good luck .
another thing a dealer needs to know is called splitting cards , so for example , if a player has two cards of the same num , numerical value , so for instance , the player here has nines , they will have to let the dealer know that they want to split those nines .so let ’ s say again , the players bet a hundred dollars and they say , “ i would like to split. [CLS] [SEP]”. [CLS] [SEP]the dealer will then , as , as you hear , split the nines .the player will then need to put another hundred dollars , match the bet , at the other nine .what the dealer needs to do , starting with the card on the left , they get one card up , ah , another nine , so they can then , if they want , each new split constitutes a new hand .it ’ s their option , if they want to split nines again .so let ’ s say they want to split the nine again .so we have the bet. [CLS] [SEP], here ’ s. [CLS] [SEP]another nine. [CLS] [SEP], we start with the card on the left , the dealer gives a new card. [CLS] [SEP], we have nineteen , it ’ s up to the player to decide if they want to stay on the nineteen , if they want to hit on the nineteen , without going over twenty-one , and those are their two decisions .the dealer will then go to the nine , hit again ,oh , look , guess it ’ s set up in order .so let ’ s just say they stay on eighteen .okay , we ’ re going to go to the other nine , hit. [CLS] [SEP], we have a sixteen , so they may want a card .so now they say , “ dealer , give me a card ” , the dealer then hits , ah , its gone over twenty-one , so this is a bust .the dealer will then take the cards , and take the bet .but just to let you know you can split any two cards , so you can split twos for example , again , put the bet up , match the bet , we have a hard here , aces are worth one or eleven , three or thirteen , they may want another hand , here ’ s another card .they have a thirteen , lets say they want to stay , we go to the card on the right , is a two , here ’ s a twelve , let ’. [CLS] [SEP]s say they want to hit , thirteen , let ’ s say they want another card , now they ’ ve busted .this hand is taken , the chip is taken .just to reiterate , you can split on any two cards .
you pretend you 're like an ambulance siren or a police siren and you do something like this .when you do that , you should probably feel tingly within your nasal cavity , and again , very relaxed in the throat area .so let 's try that again .as you 're doing the siren , you should feel , again , that air passing through the throat section and then going through the nasal cavity and out .and again , it should be very relaxed .
okay , let 's put our fingertips , let 's interlock our fingers here together and then , reach up and stretch up high .so , we want to rise up out of the hips , extending ourselves up , and then , from here , simply rock to one side and then the other .and what we 're trying to do , rising up out of the hips , is stretch the whole upper body back and forth , and once you have this gentle swing motion going , let 's go deep into our breath and expand the lungs .breath in and out .your feet are rooted in the ground , and your upper body 's moving as if you 're a tree planted in the ground , and the wind is blowing the top of the tree back and forth .
so if you just want a cheap pair this is just a little regular work glove , a little jersey glove they call it. [CLS] [SEP]and you can get them for like $ 1.99 in several different prices .then we have this one that has the rubber on it in case you are working on something that you really need to hold on to that you do n't want to drop it .well it is a good idea if you are handling glass or just a lot of things that you want to hold on tight. [CLS] [SEP], well this has the rubber and it works it is called the atlas glove .this is just a really heavy duty work glove like that. [CLS] [SEP]has it is good for mostly everything that you do around the house and outside too .
it 's very easy to do. [CLS] [SEP]i know where music track is. [CLS] [SEP]so i can go to explore find a music track like this one here for example .left click on it. [CLS] [SEP]and i drag it up into the edit window and it will automatically creates another audio track .let 's listen to it and see what we have. [CLS] [SEP]( playing )let 's say i want to take that audio track. [CLS] [SEP]and i want it to end at that point .i 'm going to cut that off and delete this move. [CLS] [SEP]this now let 's play it .( playing )that 's sort of almost makes sense musically does n't it , let 's trim this up. [CLS] [SEP]what i 'm going to do is select this and select this by holding the control key .i 'm going to slide both of those over ( playing )
okay , welcome .i 'm chita johnson and i 'm going to teach you how to be a print model .the first thing you need to know are poses .and this is pose number one in any model 's repertoire .you 're going to point the right toe , pull it inward to the left foot or left toe on your left foot .so , i 'm going to do that again .the right toe pulls into the left foot with the big toe .and i want you to take your body , let your thumbnails be forward , stomach pulled in and twist the hips from right to left , just a little bit , so that you create a broad to narrow image .this image is very important in professional modeling because you want to be broad at the shoulder , narrow at the waist and then shadow out with the legs .so i 've got my thumbnails facing forward , my knee is forward as well , a little twist in my hip. [CLS] [SEP]and this is your basic , most important , first position .on first position , for a print model , the shoulders can not be drooped or again go into bad posture .you want to keep the shoulders broad , shoulders down , slightly back .and also , you want to keep your stomach pulled in so that you have an expanded chest .this is very important in keeping the whole physique broad to narrow .
so to be successful with anything you really want to picture yourself being successful .imagine it in your head so with food if you have some goals maybe you want to set a goal that you want to eat a healthier diet .picture yourself eating healthy food and planning for it .that way when you setup to start doing it you can already somewhat have some steps in your head on how you are going to be successful .if you want to loose weight think about how you 're going to eat healthy foods and eat smaller portions and think about how you are going to look when you loose weight and how you are going to feel better .maybe you can even control your blood sugars if you have diabetes or decrease your chance in having heart disease .so the main point is just that whatever your goal is , whatever reason that you want to eat a healthy diet make sure that you picture yourself being successful .
i 'm going to demonstrate a 4 stroke roll .a 4 stroke roll is. [CLS] [SEP]just as it sounds , it 's 4 strokes and it 's done. [CLS] [SEP]right left ,right left .i 'm going to start out slow. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'll build my speed up .4 stroke roll .that was a 4 stroke roll .
with our ring finger , same spot .another thing to note is that when i 'm playing. [CLS] [SEP]my quarter notes , i 'm playing all down strokes with my pick .when i go to eighth notes , so this is one , two , three , four .and when i do eighth notes , i go , one and two. [CLS] [SEP]and .so the ands are always picked up .so here 's how that looks .four .and when i do triplets , i go ... [CLS] [SEP]down , up , down , down , up , down , down , up , down , down , up , down , down , up , down .
a arts , i 'm a freelance illustrator slash fine artist i graduated from art school. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to talk about how to frame an oil painting .for example this one here , i have the frame. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's all taped off in the back .if we took this apart we could imagine that it , want to have the glass raised off it .we really want to have glass on an oil painting , we need to make sure it has some mat board. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's not touching the surface of the painting .that 's why i have a couple mats here , so it 's raised off of it , so it 's not touching the , the final oil. [CLS] [SEP]and so that 's a very important factor when it comes to framing oil paintings .most of the time people do n't need , actually have , have frames on all paintings .what they basically do is they have just a frame part. [CLS] [SEP]and then the painting itself without the glass .because six weeks later after you finish your painting you can put a varnish on it , a medium varnish and it gives it a gloss. [CLS] [SEP]and you do n't have to really worry about it , affecting it .but that 's one of the ways that you frame oil paintings .thank you for joining me , my name is lars robinson with lars a arts .
in this series , we will be focusing on poses and postures that will be opening the chest and the hips .these are both areas of the body that tend to be pretty tight in americans .we often have jobs where we are sitting at a desk all day long .or , we are standing for long periods of time .both of these activities create tightness across the front of the chest and also in the hips , because we are not usually sitting in a position such as this as we are doing these things .so , these poses will create length across the front of the chest .open the muscles in the hips , and strengthening the opposing muscles as well .we will start our series with a three part breath , which is a basic breath , but it allows more oxygen into the lungs .it allows the diaphragm to work more efficiently .so , focusing again on the chest , we are going to be bringing more oxygen in and letting go of emotional baggage in our hips .so , let 's get started .
so we get a lot of cobalt blue on the brush and just work that in . [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to , until we work that blue in on the shore line we 're going to put some payne 's gray in just a very thin amount right next to the shore line to show that it 's sort of casting a shadow onto the water .
we are not going to apply a solid base layer not at first .this is going to be building up .what we are going to do is is we are just going to apply the light brown. [CLS] [SEP]make up to this wedge on the side here and just apply this .we are actually not going to try to make it solid .see these lines that result here. [CLS] [SEP]that 's what we are going for .it does n't matter how many you have just try not to make a solid layer of brown not yet .the area that we are going to be focusing our make-up job on over all is only on the exposed skin of the face and maybe just a little bit underneath the chin but not much .the rest we are going to try to have really wrapped up .do n't do anything on the ears those should be wrapped up .do n't do anything up above the hairline that 's going to be wrapped up .but the first step is starting with this brown and again not going solid in but rather having these wedged and line effects .its going to be very very subdued .but this is going to be face paint that we are going to build up in several preceding layers .
as we progress to the 1800 and 1900 handbags really where looking popular , they where really to off .in 1900s icons such as grace kelly and jackie o really popularize the handbags .even today if you open any magazine you would see countless celebrities with handbags or a hot bag of the season or a chanel , gucci , or a prada or some major stylist fads .bags today are about statues , they are symbolic to you know high class people and just celebrities and again as i was saying bags are statues symbols .you would see madonna carrying the latest chanel bag or sienna miller or some major celebrity. [CLS] [SEP]the olson 's and these bags are such statues symbols that every body wants them .it has got to a point where you can go down to china town in new york city and get a knock off bag with the exact logo , it is literally the same it is called a mere image replica. [CLS] [SEP]it is how popular these bags have become that everybody is knocking everybody off some everyone could have one .
this is how the for the ladies step .it looks like this .slow , quick quick .once more , slow , quick , quick .it 's not a very easy figure for the lady , but if you have learned it , it will be much more easier .so i will tell you the foot positions now .the right foot should go forward , and then turn on the ball of right foot and in the mean time close left foot to right foot , a little bit back .and then you step forward with left foot and then turn on the ball of left foot and in the mean time you close right foot to left , a little bit backwards , without wait .so once more , step forward with right foot , turn on the ball of right foot , close left foot to right foot without wait , then left foot forward , turn on the ball of left foot , close right foot to left foot without wait .and the foot technique for this step would be heel turn on the ball of right foot , inside of the ball. [CLS] [SEP]left foot , and then heel and when you turn on the ball of left foot , you close right foot on the inside of your ball .
i 'm going to put the falafel in the pita. [CLS] [SEP]but i 'm going to half it first .just because i do n't want it to be taller. [CLS] [SEP]then the pita bread itself .now make a little bit more room for some tomatoes and some lettuce and some onions .
i 've been in the personal training field for over thirteen years .i 've started two gyms , one of which is my current cross fit tucson .and i 've worked in the physical therapy and rehabilitation fields .in this group of exercises we 're going to going over upper body pushing movements .and there are three planes that we really want to cover .there 's the overhead plane , where we 're pushing away from ourselves in the vertical plane ; there 's the horizontal plane , where we 're pushing away from ourselves this way ; and then there 's the downward plane , where we 're pushing ourselves or the weight , down in that direction .so we cover all three major directions that the upper body moves in. [CLS] [SEP]so we get balanced development in all those planes .so in these pushing exercises , we 'll start with the easiest forms of the exercise and progressively go on to the harder forms of exercise in each of the planes of movement ; overhead , forward and down .
alright , and in the next step what we 're going to do is go ahead and assemble our book .that means we 're going to go ahead and pull all of our scored lines together. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 're going to assemble the photo pages on the inside , ok ?so i 'm going to go ahead and get started with that .i 'm going to go ahead and do my folds .and when you 're folding try to make sure your edges are also flush .so alright , so we got those all folded .so we 're going to open up our book again and then. [CLS] [SEP]on the inside we 're going to attach our three by eight sections. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to rotate the color. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to rotate the opening .so you 're going to have them open in such a manner , like that ,ok ?so we 'll go ahead. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll start with the bottom one .and you 're going to want to center that perfectly within the bottom square , ok.go ahead and do our second square for our insert .and once again , make sure thats opposite opening .so we 're going to go ahead and center that. [CLS] [SEP], right down in the center , there , same edge wise .alright , now that we have those in there we 're going to go ahead and add my sections , or journaling sections here .it goes on the outer edges .go ahead and get the last one .there are those , going to have them folded up .and then with our last one that we have , i had applied some liquid glass which is a embellishment .its still wet. [CLS] [SEP]so i wo n't be able to add that on there yet. [CLS] [SEP]but what you can do is , you can add that right here .when its all said and done , that will , thats where that will go. [CLS] [SEP]so when you open it up , that will be one of the first things you see .so i 'm going to go ahead and leave that there , let that finish drying .so now that we have the book assembled , our last step will be to decorate and embellish our strap thats going to go around .
in this clip we 're going to talk about the hunter character class .once you 've chosen a realm and a faction and a race you choose your class .in this case we 're talking about hunters , one of the , a main advantages to playing a hunter character is the ability to use pets .hunters use pets to help them in combat , for example , my hunter character has his pet here , is a pet pig .now i can use the pig to attack other monsters which allows me to stand back and do damage from a distance .for example , a hunter is a very proficient with ranged weapon like bows and guns and things like that and letting the pig do a lot of the damage for you allows you to do other specialized things from a distance .another advantage to playing in a hunter character is that hunters do a lot of ranged damage , they have their bows and guns .where the , which allows them to take less damage from creatures near bye .they are also another good class to solo , which means playing with by yourself rather than with a group because you have the pig there for example or you could have any kind of pet you wanted really , you have the advantage of having a built in tank character that you just bring along with you which gives you the opportunity to fight a lot of creatures. [CLS] [SEP]you would n't be able to fight by yourself .so it 's like having two players at the same time , also the armor that a different that a hunter character can where is cloth armor , leather armor. [CLS] [SEP]and once you reach level forty you can use mail armor .
okay now let 's make these strawberries .we 've already punched two little hearts .we 've got two little stars .of course you could always just cut out the shapes with scissors , and you know you do n't have to worry about them being perfect .they can be kind of rustic because , it 's sort of a rustic project .so first we 're going to take our glue stick. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll just put a little bit of glue right along the top of this heart and then stick the star right on .it 's already starting to look like a strawberry. [CLS] [SEP]is n't it ?let 's make one more .so cute , and then our hole punch .right there , so there 's something we can thread our twine through .the sharpie is going to help us make some little seeds .again this does not have to be , you know , the mona lisa .it is very rustic , casual , fun ,oh so cute .now we 're going to thread the twine that we 're using around our present through the hole .i 've used kind of a small hole .you can use a regular hole punch .the one i used is a one eighth inch .i got it at the office supply store .i find that small size really handy .oh , that 's a little longer than we want. [CLS] [SEP]is n't it ?let 's trim that up and make our knot a little bit higher .just decide where you want your little strawberries to be .you want them to dangle and not touch the table .perfect , there 's one. [CLS] [SEP], you 're going to do one a little bit longer so that they 're hanging at two different heights .would n't you love to receive a gift that looked like this .you 're neighbors are going to feel that way too .very cute !and there 's your finished present .next i 'm going to show you what else you can do with stuff in the kitchen .
the pelvic hip tuck and drop is a real nice way to accent a specific movement and a specific sound in your music .let 's start with the feet slightly apart , the knees are going to stay soft , pull your bellybutton in , lift your chest and relax your shoulders .so we 're going to allow the pelvic motion to go forward and back , and it 's all going to be right here in your hip .the abdomen is going to stay engaged the whole time , even when you 're letting it come forward , doing the drop part of it .do n't let your stomach just relax and go blah , you do n't want to do that .you want to be nice and neat and tucked , be sure to keep the chest lifted so that you do n't end up getting this movement here .keep those shoulders still because what you 're not moving is what makes the dance look so good , not what you 're moving .so , we 're going to just keep doing it , repeating it , drilling it , getting it. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's nice and precise .and this movement can either be soft or it can be a sharp movement and sometimes the accent will be on the down , on the drop , and sometimes on the tuck .so you want to make sure those knees stay nice and still so that all the movement is right here in your hip .keep that chest lifted , keep your arms out to the sides so you can see what your body 's doing .drill this in the mirror as often as you can so. [CLS] [SEP], you 'll know what it looks like when you 're out on the dance floor .
now , i am going to show you another classic step .it 's called hip drop kick .you are going to have the same position as the hip drop in the diagonal facing the audience .the audience is always in front of you .you are going to turn your body to the diagonal .you are going to tart the drop that i showed you already .the movement is like you are about to sit on a chair .then , you are going to incorporate a kick with the sit .now , i 'm going to do it in tempo .you can have different tempos ; you can have two counts or. [CLS] [SEP]you can just have 1 count of hip drop ; or you can have more pauses between the kicks .the most common tempo is 1-2 , 1-2 , 1-2.you just learned how to hip drop kick .
a very effective strike for women 's self-defense , can be seen from having two hands grabbed .once again , it 's difficult for me to get my hands involved in strikes , because they 're being held .my feet are free , but sometimes it 's easier to close the gap with your entire body .so , i 'm going to strike with my knee this time .now , one of the most standard techniques in women 's self-defense is the strike to the groin .and while that is a fairly good target , it is purely a target of opportunity .i say that because , it 's very easy for a man to defend against a strike to the groin .additionally , there are other points near that area that cause a greater degree of dysfunction and pain , than a strike to the groin would .and , a point we 're going to work on. [CLS] [SEP], is right here on the inside of the thigh .right on the side of the knee , on the inside .we 'll work on this leg here , so you can see it .but all i 'm going to do is raise my knee into it .i 'm not going to wind up , anything like this .as is , i was climbing a stair ; i 'm simply raising my foot , striking into that .boom .and as i do that , i want to stick , once again .i want to deliver energy through the strike , and then occupy that space .in doing that , it causes a great deal of dysfunction .so let me grab teresa here , and have her strike this leg here .just like that .just like that .and that 's a good striking technique , for two hands grabbed at the front .
hi i 'm ty brown with dogbehavioronline.com .we 're here in riverton , utah today teaching you how to train a dog .the topic of today 's discussion is teaching your dog how to protect .now this is the only type of training that should be undergone with a professional trainer somebody that knows how to train a dog for this type of thing .if it is done by somebody that does n't know exactly how to do it you can run the risk of hurting your dog , hurting yourself and having a big liability on your hands and so make sure to consult with a qualified professional before undertaking some type of training like this .there are two drives that we use when we train a dog to protect .we use prey drive which is the dogs natural instinct to run , grab , and catch a prey object , in this case maybe a sleeve or a whole bite suit. [CLS] [SEP]and we use the dog 's defense drive .this is the dog 's desire to defend his home , himself , his family and we use both those drives in proper balance to teach your dog what a threat is and what to do when a threat is encountered .many people mistakenly believe that because their dog loves them , he is going to protect them .most dogs wo n't .most dogs do n't know what to do in the case of a real threat and so this is something that needs to be trained .as i said before make sure you consult with a qualified professional as this is going to take a long time of training. [CLS] [SEP]and it is going to be very important to do it the right way so that you do n't have a liability on your hands .
are you having problems choosing the right colors to compliment your skin tone ?have you been everywhere looking for the right color ?well , today i 'm going to show you how to chose the right foundation color for black skin tones .now , there are so many colors on the market today that 's. [CLS] [SEP]it 's very important that you take your time when choosing the right color for your foundation .the easiest way to do this is to take several shades that you think compliment your skin tone .one at a time , take a swipe along the jawline , using one to three colors .once you find your desired shade , you 're well on your way to looking your most best .this looks great .so , once you 've found your shade , simply begin to apply .now , depending on the product brand that you chose , finding the shade may be difficult .if you 're a black woman searching for a foundation , look for lines that are specifically made for black women .there are tons of products on the market and there 's a lot to chose from .remember to take your time , this is something that you want to get right .we do n't want you to be too light. [CLS] [SEP]and we do n't want you to be too dark. [CLS] [SEP], we want you to look naturally and look your beautiful best .my name is sylvia russell. [CLS] [SEP]and this is how you can chose the right foundation shade for black skin .
i 'm going to do a white eyeliner inside her eye .we kind of smoked out the outside with the brown. [CLS] [SEP]but i really want her eyes to pop , especially since it 's got that orange .i do n't want it to be too dark and sultry. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm going to use a white kohl eyeliner. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's just a soft eyeliner .i 'm going to line the inside of her eye and. [CLS] [SEP]what that 's going to do is it 's really going to brighten her eyes and make it pop .just make sure you 're very gentle .make sure your eyeliner is clean and just go very easy on the inside of the eye .if you have a good liner , it 's going to go on really nice and smooth. [CLS] [SEP]and you 'll be able to see that white right away .and look so far at the difference between one and the other ...it just really pops the eye .and depending , you can add a little more ,how bright you want it to be .i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]sure we 've all seen this white eyeliner .and look at the difference by just adding a little bit of this eyeliner into the eye , what a difference this makes .it just brightens the eye , one compared to the other .and it just really accentuates that orange color .this is great for photographic .it 's fine too , for going out .but it 's fantastic for photographic , i mean it 's really just going to make that orange pop and make the eye look bigger and brighter .
so if you 're thinking about makeup and you 're preppy , in general the idea is to look like you 're naturally very attractive and very healthy .the entire look is clean , it 's simple , there are no bright colors , there 's no heavy eyeliner .i have done a series on goth. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's really the opposite of that. [CLS] [SEP], goth is about contrast whereas the preppy look is really all about being natural and blending together , so the base of that is always going to be good pressed powder , or a good foundation , and i have two of those here .either way , you want your complexion basically to be matte , it can be a little bit dewy , a little bit shiny , but in general you want to look like you have very healthy skin and the skin should be just blended into the background .people should n't even be able to tell that you 're wearing makeup .if you do want to wear makeup though , the most you should ever do is a good mascara , and some lip-gloss .and the idea is to just enhance your natural beauty .the lip-gloss. [CLS] [SEP]i picture is a light color , it 's not bright , there 's no glitter in it. [CLS] [SEP], there 's no purple in it , it 's a natural shade , and i actually have it on my lips right now , and it just blends in with them and accents the color very naturally .and the same thing with the mascara , it should n't be a heavy , thick , five coats of mascara , just a little bit of an accent .the idea is to be very naturally beautiful .
hi. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm richard fields .today we are going to talk about how to pitch a tend .the first thing you are going to want to do is if this tent is new to you set it up at home .practice with it there .you are not going to want to be out in the wilderness and find out that you do n't have all the parts and have no clue how to set it up .having done that , the first thing you will want to do whether you choose to use a ground cloth or not is to prepare the ground .you want to select a place that does n't have any green grass or plants growing , that is just an impact thing. [CLS] [SEP]and then you are going to want to remove all sharp sticks and rocks and things like that so that you will have a comfortable sleep. [CLS] [SEP]and you wo n't damage the bottom of the tent .you want a spot that is level if all possible .if it ca n't be perfectly level you want to set your tent so that when you are lying in it your head is going to be at the high end .everything is going to be a little different. [CLS] [SEP]so the important point with whichever tent you choose is that you want the bottom to be taut and you want the tent well staked down so that the wind does n't blow it away when you are not in it .also when you are taking out your tent and you are laying out the tent and your ground cloth and everything else , anchor it down especially in windy conditions so you do n't end up having to chase these parts around , just use any convenient rock to keep these things in place .when you stake down the bottom of your tent you want to try to make sure you do n't get it distorted so that way when the whole tent is up. [CLS] [SEP]it will tend to be more taut and will be more resistant to wind and more likely allow rain to shed off of it .depending on the kind of tent you have you can put the stakes in before or after you put the poles up .we are going to go ahead and put these poles in. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 'll put the rain. [CLS] [SEP]fly on to get the whole thing set up and taut .now that you have got your tent properly set , you are ready for a good night 's sleep .if the soil seems a little soft or it is very windy you might consider putting a rock on the stakes to help keep them in place .that 's how to pitch a tent .have a good time .
an important aspect in designing a cardiovascular program is to know what your target heart rate is .my name is alice monsaert. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to give you an easy formula today to figure out what your target heart rate is based on your age .in the fitness industry for years we have been using a simple calculation of 220 minus your age which gives us the maximum heart rate .now it is nearly impossible to work at maximum heart rate or 100 % of your heart rate for a very long period of time. [CLS] [SEP]so we take a percentage of that and for a healthy individual we are going to multiply that number times .6. [CLS] [SEP]which we would be working at 60 % of maximum heart rate .we are going to take a 40 year old person today and do their target heart rate for 60 %so if we subtract 40 from 220 we get 180 , multiply that by 6. [CLS] [SEP]and we get 108 beats per minute. [CLS] [SEP]so if you have a heart rate monitor on or you want to check your pulse during your cardiovascular activity then you would need to be at about 108 beats per minute for an extended period of time to get a training effect on the heart .in the fitness industry we are kind of moving away from that and going more with perceived which means how does your workout really feel for you ?on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being very easy , perhaps sitting on the couch and 10 being an all out effort where you have got to run away from someone , we want to work at about a 4 to a 7.so something that is comfortably challenging , something that is going to allow you to extend your heart rate , your target heart rate for about 20 to 30 minutes and over the course of time that will have a training effect on the heart , make the heart and lungs much stronger. [CLS] [SEP]and you 'll be a more fit person .so again target heart rate or rating of perceived exertion or your cardiovascular fitness program .this is alice .stay healthy and i 'll see you next time .
hi , i 'm tristan mccauley from lucky seven tattoo , and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm here to talk to you about the dangers of piercing a belly button .first and foremost , you want to make sure that you , the shop you 're getting pierced at is a reputable shop ; they 're maintained by a local health department or something of that nature .you never want to do it at home by yourself .you want to make sure that you 're havin. [CLS] [SEP]' it done by somebody that knows what they 're doin ' .that way , you have a better chance of not screwin ' yourself up .another thing ; you want to make sure that all the tools , the needles , and the jewelry are all prepackaged and pre-sterilized .dirty jewelry , dirty utensils can lead to an infection , and in the navel it 's very painful. [CLS] [SEP], it 's irritating , and it just all around sucks .another problem that people have with a piercing is because of where it 's at .it 's in your stomach which is basically the hinge of your body , and it usually takes a bit longer to heal because of that and some people just get irritated by that .another thing you get , that is a problem is taking your shirts on and off .it can get caught on the bottom and pull upwards , or it can get caught on the top when you 're puttin ' it on and that will tear a little bit .another problem is sweat .when you sweat it gets in the piercing .it can irritate it .you want to make sure you wash it really well if you sweat .the best jewelry to use for it is a curved barbell like this or a belly jewel .this lessens the chance of irritation .it does n't move very much from side to side or up and down , so there 's less chance of an irritation .but these are just some of the problems that some people have with belly piercings .
o.k. [CLS] [SEP], so now we 're going to talk about the bottom ring .so there 's a few different possibilities that you might have on your drum for a bottom ring .this drum here you wo n't be able to get it off because it 's not big enough to fit over here. [CLS] [SEP]so this drum maker welded the ring on the drum .so if you want to change out the rope you 're going to have either work , wrap the ring while it 's on the drum which you can do. [CLS] [SEP]or we 're going to cut it off because the ring is we 're. [CLS] [SEP], we 're going to show you , we 're going to remake it with rope because that 's how we 've been doing it these days .another possibility although improbable that you 're going to have this is a ring like this , it you can expand it to put it on your drum. [CLS] [SEP]and then you close it , and you put your bolt in it. [CLS] [SEP], it 's kind of a cool system. [CLS] [SEP]but we 're not really doing that anymore .we 're mostly using this one has a rope ring. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's just your rope doubled around .so we 're going to show you how to do a ring like this. [CLS] [SEP]so if you choose to cut it off we 're going to show you how we 're going to do that in a second .so just figure out if you want to change the bottom ring. [CLS] [SEP]then we 're going to do that now .
alright , now we 're going to get our rice ready .depending upon how many people you 're going to feed depends on how many cups you 're going to put in .we like to put half a cup for every mouth you 're going to feed .if there 's 5 people that 's 5 half cups .this is 3 , 4 , 5 , and actually i think we 're going to go ahead and go for 6 because i think a few of us are going to want seconds .what the heck , let 's go for 7 because this is going to be good .alright , this is the right everybody .take a look at it .sometimes there 's black ones , sometimes there 's ones that are no good. [CLS] [SEP]and you can see it , but this is actually a very good selection of white rice here .this is just average white rice .you can pick it up at your average grocery store .goya works best .there it is .that is the rice .that was 6 half cups of rice .i 'm going to come over here real quick and grab this little spoon right here and make sure that this is twisting .make sure i got this going over here .then i 'm going to come over here to my sauce , give it a little stir .this is when you check it .this is when you 're going to go with your taste buds .yes .
choosing a type of balance is sometimes demanded by what you 're doing .if you 're going to do a kaleidoscope or something , then you 're probably going to have to make it in the center of the page .and , as i said before , symmetry is about formality .it can create a very definite statement , i mean , you ca n't get around this .you 're very clear about what this is , it hits you , it 's simple , and it works very well using up the center of the page and being symmetrical .but symmetry can also create a very `` quiet '' kind of feel , this is a little bit off , it 's not exactly on center , but it 's enough on center because we 've got this very strong point here .but it leaves a very `` quiet '' sense that you would n't get if you can imagine moving this person over here , and moving everything over. [CLS] [SEP]so you have more of the diagonals .that would give you more dynamism , really , the diagonals do , but you would n't get the sense of `` quiet contemplation '' .and we have , i 'll let you decide between these two , this is a dega , and this is a monet .and this one is more or less very centered in the page .this one is definitely asymmetrical , you 've got people over here , you 've got scenery over here .just feel for yourself how dynamic this feels compared to this one .so if you want to suggest movement or something very often , you 're going to end up with an asymmetrical kind of balance .
if you have stains around the house from you tracking dirt in back and forth on the grout , and you 'd like to clean it , here 's a few ways you can do it .first thing you 're going to need. [CLS] [SEP]is you 're going to need a bucket .any size bucket will do .you 're going to need to get some type of cleaner , whether it 's a vinegar , an acid based cleaner like this , or any kind of solvent you can really use on the grout .do not use bleach if it 's a colored grout .if it 's a white grout , bleach is okay , but if it 's colored grout , do not use bleach because it will discolor your grout .you 're also going to need a scotch pad like this .this is a heavy duty scotch pad .this 'll clean a lot better than some of your medium or light duty scotch pads .i recommend using safety glasses just because with acid based cleaners , they send off fumes and it would get in your eyes or. [CLS] [SEP]if it gets in your eyes from splashing or whatever , it 'll really burn .and also you 'll have to wear gloves with an acid based cleaner just to keep it off your hands because it will burn your hands as well .what you want to do for a heavy duty stain , is you 're going to want to dilute your acid cleaner , one part acid , one part water .and then you 're going to take your scotch pad with your gloves on. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to want to go ahead and dip it in the acid .and then you 're going to want to scrub it real good on the grout joint .the more elbow grease you use , the better it 's going to turn out .so if you scrub those joints really , really good , it should turn out really well .then what you 're going to want to do. [CLS] [SEP]is you 're going to have another bucket also with clean water and a sponge .after you 're done scrubbing the grout joints , you 're going to want to get your sponge , wring it out , and then wipe those grout joints off real good .make sure you wipe it off with clean water because if you do n't , an acid based compound can eat through the grout .my name 's ryan parker with parker home renovations and you can find me at parkerhomerenovations.com .
wall squats can be done using the stability ball behind your back .you start with the ball at your lower back , and go ahead and bring your feet out , so that you 're at an angle .adjust the ball so that it 's right in that nice arch of your lower back , always engaging the abs .you want to make sure that when you bend down , that your knees are over the ankles .so if it turns out that your knees are over your toes , you want to make sure that your feet come out even a little bit further , okay ,so that 's good alignment .and what we 're going to do is wall squats in three different positions , so we 're going to take a nice inhale , and down ; exhale , squeeze the glutes , pushing against the heels and come up ; inhale , bend down , exhale , engage the abs , squeeze the glutes , push against the heels , pick up the toes if you can , and come up .the second position is to go ahead and latterly rotate the feet , you 'll need to bring them a dash closer together , take a nice inhale , and bend the feet down ; exhale , pushing from the heels , feeling it in here , inhale bend .so we 're kind of getting a back massage while we 're working our legs ; exhale up .and the final position is medially rotating the feet , so we 're working the inner part of the quadriceps , go ahead ; and it 's called the femoral muscles , go ahead and take a nice inhale , and bend the knees ; now i should put my feet out to make sure they 're aligned with the ankles , and exhale , squeeze up ; inhale bend the knees , still staying on the heels , exhale up .we want to stay off the toes because that engages the quadriceps , we 're as the heel is going to engage the back of the leg .and those are wall squats .
and the egg wash , again , is milk , a pinch of salt and egg yolk .once in a while a piece of white gets in there. [CLS] [SEP]but we do n't mind that .you wash it nice and neat , all around because , if you miss a spot , that spot wo n't have the desired color .then you roll it in your oats , just to give it a different look .you have a tray of oats available here , at all times .just roll it. [CLS] [SEP]and then you put it on the belts .what that belt does , that belt helps us get it inside that oven , all the way to the end .the oven is six point two square meters of baking surface and it weighs about nine thousand pounds .it took them four days to build it here. [CLS] [SEP]and it cost them sixty-five thousand dollars .that oven is able to keep the heat consistent , all over the oven .front and back are almost identical , in terms of temperature .one of the problems , most bakers have and most home ovens have , is that the front of the oven is cooler than the back of the oven , giving the inconsistencies .these oven uses the most advanced technologies where it has pipes , all around it , it has a central cooking element , that 's gassed driven .it heats up the steam , steam moves in these rolling pipes , all around the ovens and creates a constant temperature so when you put your dough in there , you do n't have a cool spot and a hot spot .all of the oven , has an identical temperature .
there are a lot of ways to glaze pottery .obviously you need to have it bisque fired first .you can dip the pieces into buckets of glaze that 's already been created .you can create glazes yourself .there 's recipes everywhere out there , especially on the internet , and you can always use applications like brushes .brushes come in a wide range of shapes , materials , thickness of hair , also in the horsehair which are really nice , delicate brushes that give you that really thin edge .my favorite one .wide application surfaces. [CLS] [SEP]so if you have a large piece this is great .dip it in the glaze , paint it on , usually if you 're painting glazes you have to do at least three coats. [CLS] [SEP]otherwise the surface wo n't get the full glaze it needs .you also have very detailed brushes you can purchase , and you can buy these at your local vendor or even online .i 've purchased actually most of these online .this is another great brush that 's perfect for the bottom surfaces of vases .it just gives you that flat surface .really easy to put on .
you know , you have the basic layup , and then you have a variation of cool ways to shoot a layup as well .one way is called the finger roll .hi , i 'm travis , and i 'm going to show you how to shoot that -- how to shoot the finger roll .now , when you 're shooting a finger roll , you have a number of ways that you can do it , but before you get to the basket .but the basic -- the basics are once you get to the basket , and you get yourself into position to shoot that layup , that finger roll. [CLS] [SEP], you want to come in , dribble the ball , and pick the ball up early enough to where you can get enough space between you and the rim and take off with enough space between you and the rim , so that when you take off , the ball is here , and you roll it right off your finger .that 's why they call it a finger roll , because when you release your hand , it rolls right off your finger into the basket .right off your finger into the basket .kind of like that .and you want to kind of give it a forward rotation .during shooting a jump shot , or a set shot , you got to have that backwards rotation , but in this shot you want to have that forward rotation , and that 's the finger roll .so , let me show you what it looks like .a little something like this .come up , roll it right off your finger , and if you take off from further out , you might actually get a full roll .but if you 're shooting it a little closer to the basket , you kind of just toss it in .and that 's shooting a finger roll .
one common mistake to make while crocheting is to not crochet the last stitch in your row .you get to the end. [CLS] [SEP]and you think you 're done. [CLS] [SEP]and you turn your work .so , for example here , i might think i was done. [CLS] [SEP]and i would turn it , but you can see that i 've cut down on my stitches already. [CLS] [SEP]and i would go back .and another thing to do , would be not to crochet the first stitch , but skip a stitch .and what happens is it will begin to reduce my number of stitches and change how it looks .crochet is very forgiving though , i can just take out my stitches , come back to where i was over here , put the yarn back on the hook , and finish that last stitch that i had neglected in the row before .and another thing you can see is that i 've got a straight line , here , as whereas before when i did n't finish that last stitch. [CLS] [SEP]i had a bit of a step .
our focus right now is in the post .how to defend the post .there 's several ways you can defend a post , and again a lot of this comes back to knowing your particular player .if this post player is very strong on the right side , and he likes to catch the ball , and he likes to drop step to the baseline , one thing we 're going to try to do with our defense is take that away from him .so what we 're going to have our defender do -- go ahead and post up here. [CLS] [SEP]-- we 're going to have our defender play defense here by stepping his front foot around the front .go ahead and step your foot around his front .no , the other foot .yes , there you go .because we want to have a defense on the full front side , so that we can keep this guy. [CLS] [SEP]that 's feeding it. [CLS] [SEP]-- we can keep him completely out of it , all right .what happens is it becomes a war .if this guy takes his foot and re-steps around to re-post , then what our defensive guy has to do is keep stepping .and sometimes you 'll see players do this for five minutes , trying to fight for position .now , go up to the top side .if his favorite move is he likes to catch it. [CLS] [SEP]and he likes to go to the middle , then we want to take the middle away by having him step around to the front side , so that he does n't do that move .and the same thing .you 've got to figure out your post player on the left side .we played one in particular team where they had a dominant post player that liked to drop step to the left , so we played him strong to the one side , and took that left drop step away .you 've got to know your player , and that 's a particular way -- two ways , that you can defend the post from playing behind the player .
so with bachata you want to start with the most basic step first and rhythm .here 's what it looks like ( dancing )so breaking it down. [CLS] [SEP]it 's a three step pattern. [CLS] [SEP]and then there 's a hip , a little hip action that happens .so it starts with the right. [CLS] [SEP], feet come together step right again as the foot comes in. [CLS] [SEP]you 're going to sink down on a plie , which means a bent knee .you are going to lift that hip a little bit you are isolating the hip , look at what i 'm doing ( dancing ) trying to isolate the hip .then we do the same thing step together step and hip , so that is the basic step .let 's try it again. [CLS] [SEP]it goes right left right hip left. [CLS] [SEP]right left hip. [CLS] [SEP]right left right hip left. [CLS] [SEP]right left hip .so know we 're going to take the step. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're actually going to do what this step that i just showed you is more in a closed position .when you are closed you will be able to cross , now if you are in a open position it 's the same step. [CLS] [SEP]but we can make it much bigger .how do we do that ?you 're going to cross over with them left instead of stepping together. [CLS] [SEP]it looks like this .( dancing ) step cross , step hip step cross. [CLS] [SEP]step hip so breaking that down step to the right .you are actually going to cross over so instead of having to bring in the foot in you are going to pass your other foot , cross it over step as you bring this foot .give it a hip and left right left hip .now let me talk about the hip you can do different things you can make it small , ladies you want to actually excentuate the hip as much as you want .gentleman if you are n't comfortable doing the hip you do n't have to do it at all .if you want you can just do a little bit of a tap just make sure that you 're doing a little bit of an accent there and holding that beat .but ladies you definitely want to do the hip , men. [CLS] [SEP]the hip is optional. [CLS] [SEP]you can add that hip in or you can take that hip out .i 've seen it both ways. [CLS] [SEP]so that is the basic bachata step. [CLS] [SEP], let me show you one last time ( dancing ) .here 's closed position bachata. [CLS] [SEP]and now we 'll go into open position .
okay , take your last piece of wire .now you need to make your final connection from here to the end of the switch .so what you 're going to do just going to make that little hook easiest way , unscrew this , tighten it .now you put the other one through .now you can see you got your connection going .you got your switches on both ends connected .you got your battery connected also to your light bulb .and this is , notice , that this is still free standing .and we 're going to rely on the electrons going through the wire and making contact .an electromagnetic contact with this piece of tin .this is were you 're going to get that sound ( dit , dit , dit , dit ) and at the same time , this light bulb should go , wew , wew , wew , every time you touch the switch .
of course , as we all make our talks , probably , the most traditional problem that we have , is in dealing with the question about having an interesting topic .everybody wants to have an interesting topic .and people like to hear about interesting things .and of course , when you have something like that , it 's really great .because everybody is right on the edge of the seat , listening .but then , there 's the opposite problem .a lot of times , we might have topics that they 're just totally , boring to us .this creates a problem .i 'll just give you one , extreme example .let 's say , i 'm a speaker .and i 'm just really bored with my topic .and i just you know , i come in and .well , o.k .i think that this topic about the swimming pool .well , yeah , it 's kind of , interesting .and i think that we could probably solve it , in the end .and you know , we talked about that before with the non skid surface .how does that communicate ?at the same time , when you start doing something like that , where you 're starting to communicate emotion , you know , what happens ?even the audience starts to mirror your emotion .if you 're going to be bored , what 's going to happen with your audience ?oh !and here we have like ,i 'm talking to my people , out here .and i 'm trying to communicate .and i 'm you know ,it just , it 's really a boring topic .now here we have a clue .you 'd better be looking at your audience .and i 'm looking out there. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm seeing some people that do n't look like they 're really that interested in my topic .i have to do something .i better be thinking , real quick .that maybe , i had better try and uplift my speaking , a little bit .and try and be more interesting about my topic .
so , when we talk in terms in advanced keet kune do , it 's not necessarily the techniques are any different. [CLS] [SEP], it 's more how you train and what you train , the way you train .so , jan and i are going to demonstrate something that probably. [CLS] [SEP]about 20 if not 30 years ago differentiate. [CLS] [SEP]jeet kune do training from everything else and this is the trapping now .this is going to be some. [CLS] [SEP]what static , it 's not going to be the dynamic stuff because i really want you to get the essence. [CLS] [SEP]and then we also have to put into historical context and how this trapping was first introduced .so , as we film these clips , i just want you to keep in mind that this is not going to appear realistic but is just again another training method .
so we are just going to tare these pieces , it do n't need to be the same size or the same shape .i 'm going to be using 3 different colors to decorate my flower pot .once i have my torn pieces i 'm going to take my decoupage solution which you can get at your craft store. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to brush it on the pot. [CLS] [SEP]and then we are going to stick on our tissue paper .at the top you just curl the top edge , curl it around the edge. [CLS] [SEP]and you just continue to brush on the solution and press down your tissue pieces until your whole pot is covered .the pot is now dry and ready to put flowers in .
today i 'm going to teach you how to replace a door .if you have a damaged door or a door that is swollen or warped and no longer fits. [CLS] [SEP]and you need to replace it. [CLS] [SEP]you can go down to any hardware store to do so .what you need to do is you need to measure the opening of the door , height and width and go down to your local home improvement store. [CLS] [SEP]and you can give them the measurements. [CLS] [SEP]and they can find a door for you .you need to know if it is an interior door or an exterior door , whether you want it to be steel or wood , whether you want it to be solid core or hollow core .there are many options to choose from as far as designs as well. [CLS] [SEP]so you need to make up your mind before you get down there or before you decide to purchase one , which one you want .the first thing you need to do once you get your new door is you come in and take out the old door .so what you do is you open up the door. [CLS] [SEP]and you have to get a screw gun and unscrew the screws from the hinge on all the hinges of the door to disconnect the door from the door jam .then you 'll need to take your door knob hardware off and remove the hinge from the door side also .you 'll have to get the hinge completely off the door in order to put it on the new door .now they have different types of new doors .they have the pre-drilled ones and then they have the blank ones .the blank doors do not have the hole for the door knob hardware , you have to drill it yourself. [CLS] [SEP]and they 're usually not mortised for the hinges either .but the pre-drilled ones do have the hole already drilled and they 're already mortised for a hinge .so i prefer to use a pre-drill just because it saves you some work .so once you get your pre-drilled and it is already mortised , bring it back to the house , mount the hinge in your mortise slot and you 'll want to pop your screws back in the door. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 'll want to hold on to the door .you might need to get somebody to help you keep the door up to keep it level and in place. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 'll pop the screws in the other set of the hinge to screw the door to the door jam. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 'll mount your door knob hardware back on the door. [CLS] [SEP]and then you have hung your door .
this is not a simple pose , but , for beginners we 're going to show you a nice way to get into it .starting in four limbs staff pose , out from your hands and knees , extend the fingers , the feet back to the back edge of your mat. [CLS] [SEP]so you 're in a high plank position .very nice .there 's a lot of stress and strain on the shoulder. [CLS] [SEP]so we 're going to do this from the knees .so gently bring the knees to the floor .notice how the hips are still in line with the shoulders .and the movement is going to go forward , so inhale , take the crown of the head forward and on the exhale bend the elbow in towards. [CLS] [SEP]you 're snugging to the waist .so as you lower down , hold right there , very nicely done , shoulders are lifted and then release all the way down to the floor .awesome !coming into a low cobra , lift the head , neck and shoulders , our hands do n't move , the fingers are wide , press into the first knuckle of your first finger and feel the elbow squeeze on to the back .shoulder blades engaged , lift the shoulders and rotate them away from the floor .it 's nice to have a length in the back of the neck. [CLS] [SEP]so you 're not strain to look for some , looking up , but just at the ground in front of you .and then release to the floor .nice .
i am starting to just say ; `` well you know i have these what can i do with this as a picture ? ''so , you know you just keep going , this way i am going to sort of keep my idea of what might be happening and where you can go from there .here i have my piece of paper. [CLS] [SEP]and i started with this and kept them in position .so , i have got a piece of paper. [CLS] [SEP], this is and interesting composition , you always go back to that .what is the composition doing for me ?and , all of a sudden i have parts of the ribcage are still there .but , now i am really abstracting it .now i am starting to go somewhere else .you found your visual material in the bones , in the ribcage structure. [CLS] [SEP]and then you start working with it .
the next thing that i want to talk about is your proper lighting and heating , for a crested gecko .crested geckos are a tropical species , they do n't need as much heating as say. [CLS] [SEP]a desert species does but a little bit of heating might still be necessary , depending on your home .you need to keep the gecko anywhere between seventy two to seventy-five degrees temperature .you can go a little bit higher but do n't go too much more than eighty-five , at any stretch of the imagination .often case , a simple heat fixture , just like this , a lamp with a ceramic top , always make sure you have a ceramic top , and a twenty-five or a fifty watt bulb ,usually , seventy-five tops , will do you , as far as heating goes .again , you 're not going and looking for any super high temperatures you just want to keep the cage at a constant , slightly warm temperature , just above what you probably keep your house at .the other thing you need to think about also , is the uvb light .uvb comes from florescent fixtures , either a compact or the good old tube fixture , and what that does is the uvb , gives the animal uvb light , which he needs to create vitamin d three , in his body , and move calcium into the bone structure .it 's always a good thing to have , especially for young animals as they 're growing and they need all the calcium they can get .this will probably , it 's not going to put off a lot of heat , but if you 're keeping your house in the seventy-two degree area already , one of these is probably enough to keep your crested gecko nice and happy .what we 're looking for in a crested gecko 's cage , is not necessarily high heats but you do want a high humidity .you definitely want to keep the humidity up and the heat to around seventy to seventy-five degrees .
moving on to half lotus ; now many people are familiar with the traditional yoga pose , called lotus pose where both feet are on opposite sides .that is very difficult to do .it takes many years of practice in order to do that .so we 're going to start with a half lotus and even then , be mindful of your knees because this is a comprising position for the knees .to help with that , we 're going to keep our ankle flexed .let 's take the right leg first .flexing that ankle that creates a nice firm foundation from the sole of the foot into the knee .we 're going to slowly bring that foot up on to the thigh keeping the foot flexed .bringing the heal deep into the crease where the leg meets the body .sitting up nice and tall .and if we feel pain in through the knee , we want to release this because again this is a comprising position for knees that are susceptible to injury .
the next board type we are going to be talking about is free ride board .this board differs greatly from the previously mentioned alpine board on a number of levels .first of all the board has nose and a tail to it whereas the alpine only has a nose .this board has a semi-directional shape to it as opposed to the alpine 's directional which means it can be ridden either way. [CLS] [SEP]but if you were going to spin it with the tail in front it is not going to ride correctly as it would with the nose in front .the tail is shorter than the nose on a free ride board to allow the nose of the board to rise above the powder .on every board comes premarked center mounting spots which is where you should mount the bindings .if you would like to offset a free ride board to a freestyle board just simply move the front binding up one set of holes from the factory marked holes .the boots used on a free ride board are a traditional snow board boot like so. [CLS] [SEP]and they go into the binding after you loosen up the straps .
so , we 're learning the bachata partnering .the basic steps .in the last clip we did the side to side basic , now we 're going to do the front and back basic .we 're staying in a closed position and we are going to start with the side to side basic so you can see the difference .here 's the side to side .it goes one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .front and back , five , six , other side again .side , three , four , five , six. [CLS] [SEP], here 's the forward and back transition .two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .notice , the transition .the side to side. [CLS] [SEP], we 're in closed position , i 'm using my frame .now , to shift to going front and back , i have to give a little bit of a push here. [CLS] [SEP]and i have to release some of the pressure from the back to let her know .also , instead of being lined up square , i 'm going to line up a little bit off center so that my foot falls right in between hers and her foot 's. [CLS] [SEP]going to be right in between mine .then we come back , two , three , and .again , let me show it one more time , smoothing it out .it goes basic , two , three , five , six , seven .transition .notice i pushed on my hand a little bit .i exaggerated it .one more time to the side .now here 's the front and back step .front , two , three , and , five , six , seven , eight .that 's the bachata switching from side basic to front and back basic .
this will be more like a soul kind of thing from maybe the fifties or sixties with a strut style .i 'm just strutting the chord and following what ?s in. [CLS] [SEP]between without losing the timing .sometimes you can get to fast with it , and it ?s. [CLS] [SEP]alright .it will still sound cool anyway as long as you go back to the chord .
now we need a way to seal the back to the picture frame itself .so the way i do this , i 'm going to be using some metal fasteners , the easiest way to close up the two pieces of cardboard .and , before i do that , i 'm going to have to make some points on the picture frame as to where i 'm going to make the holes , and where i 'm going to put the fasteners inside .now the reason why i 'm going to be using the fasteners is because they can open up and close easily .so , therefore , i can change the picture any time i want .i just open up the fastener and take off the back .so i make my points .i 'm going to be making four points , one on each side of the picture frame .and once i have those points i go and take a sharp object , i 'm using an x-acto knife , and make a hole .and that will be the point where i can insert the gold metal fasteners .even though the gold metal fasteners are going to be covered up with some masking tape and some regular color paint , i do n't want to put too many because it makes it harder to do the project having to cover them all up .so i just put one on each side .and it 's also important to note that the hole should not be too big .you want , the paper has a tendency to widen after the fastener is put in .so you do n't want to make it too wide .you just want to make a small hole to give enough of an opening that you can insert the fastener .then once it 's in it will fit nice and snug and you can go ahead and open and close the other end as the ends of the fastener separate .and , therefore , you 'll be able to separate the two pieces of cardboard and insert the picture .so i 've now shown you how to make your four points along the picture frame and make holes so that you 'll be able to insert the metal fasteners .
so , now to add some color .i love this aquamarine blue color , so i 'll be using that to color the inside of my flowers .so , pretty much what i do is , i go towards the bottom of the leaf. [CLS] [SEP]and i just bring my paintbrush up really slowly , very easy .just pull it up , pull it up , pull it up , and what it ends up doing is giving a really cool striped look to your flower .and i really , really love it .again , when you need new paint , just stick it back in there and do it really. [CLS] [SEP]however you see looks the best .and what i like to do at the tips of them , is just put some dots in there .and there you go , for some of the basic coloring .
so , once you have a hoophouse , and you realize the profound value of every inch , invariably , you start to go up , so look around and you can see the vertical space , here .the space is valuable , right to the ceiling , and so we want to build it in such a way , that we can utilize both the ground space , and the vertical space .this center structure was put in as a bracing , to keep snow loads , from collapsing the hoophouse , but it has the secondary benefit of making a wonderful boardwalk , so we have all kinds of space for plants here , and then underneath , the shade , cooler loving plants , like the beets , and the onions and the leeks .they can still hang out , and get a little bit of respite from the heat , and then that 's not all , because we have crops , which will go up , up , up , and be trellised right to the center perlin .you can see the remnants of last year 's string beans , which were fourteen feet high , and itching to go higher , so the entire hoophouse is a project in managing space , and i 'm always taking trays and putting them in new places .let 's say it 's too hot , for these little lettuces .i could tuck them over to here , and that would give them a little more shade .let 's say i had something like these delfiniums , that were heat loving .i can tuck them right in here , against this black barrel , where they just get all the heat , and then if i have something like peppers , or eggplants , or tomatoes , that really love heat , i 'll put them up to the upper shelves , where it 's up into the nineties .just so long as i can get up there , review them , and remember to hydrate them in time .
hi , this is doc lowry and we 're talking about primitive tattoo machines compared to a modern machine .most of the primitive machines are home-made equipment , or are referred to as jail-house rigs .they usually consist of , kind of the same elements .they take , they build off the tube. [CLS] [SEP]so take like a big pen tube and use black tape to tape a cassette motor to it and then have a guitar string or that they sharpen and use as a needle and the arm and that they take their little motor and put a little eraser on it with a clip in it. [CLS] [SEP]so it makes a little off-set driver out of it , and they 're pretty simple , easy to make .they make them out of cassette motors , they make them out of electric razors , hair clippers .some people will take tooth picks or tooth brushes and sharpen the end of their tooth brush and tattoo with that .they make really ugly tattoos .the biggest problem with a home-made machine of that type is that that puts a vibration in the needle so that you ca n't get a clean line with it. [CLS] [SEP]and you ca n't penetrate to the depth that you need to because the end of the needle is bouncing back and forth sideways , that way .this machine , that 's the primary difference. [CLS] [SEP]is that it shoots straight up and down and you can adjust the depths so not only can you get the depth that you need ,the needles , the needles going straight instead of wobbling so that you get a nice , clean tattoo out of it .
i actually had to run it for a little bit because there 's no wind .so , to keep it off the ground , you know , keep from getting too scuffed up , i kind of had to book it , but now what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to give it a couple of extra little shakes to make sure i can try and get the sand out , specially from this area in between the leading edge and the canopy right here .if it gets stuck up in there. [CLS] [SEP], that 's one of the worst places that it can actually , you know , start to rub and scuff up the kite .the seams all right there are something that can really sort of break , and eventually that 's a real big pressure point on the kite ,so right up inside you want to do your best and get all the sand out of there .so , i can just grab the bridles , you know .if there 's wind , i can just hold the kite up into the wind. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm just going to shake it .again , all my struts should be clipped , so i 'm going to go along and unclip all my struts , and i can see that i have a perfectly clear area right here ,where it 's not too sandy .there 's nothing that , you know , could possibly hurt my kite here .go ahead , and i will deflate it .this is the worst part right here .usually , when there 's no wind , and you do this , that 's when it gets windy , and the whole kite loses shape .i can let it just fall to the ground .i 'm going to hop off , and fold it out , and try and get off any little excess sand , like right here on the wingtips .these pulleys right here on the bridles are something that can often times. [CLS] [SEP]really cause issues .you can see that this little section of the bridle right here has definitely gotten a lot more wear and tear than this section right here .these bridles , if you 're a really active kiter , should absolutely be checked every single time you go out , and you should probably replace them , even if it does n't look like they need it , every six months .so , every time i finish off for the day , make sure that , you know , my pulleys are , you know , as nice and sort of free as possible .right now you can see this thing is pretty sandy .it 's a little bit wet , and that sand out. [CLS] [SEP]there is just like flour .so , i 'm actually just going to fold it up and that 's about as good as i can do for this time .
you need to have some tension between the mouthpiece and your vibrating lips ; however a temptation among younger players is press as hard as possible to try to get those high notes when they are not coming out .so what happens is that they end up pulling the horn very hard to their face like so .if you are playing too hard , your are going to notice maybe two things .first of all you would very quickly develop a ring around your mouth that is a indentation from the mouthpiece .now if you have been playing for a extended period of time , that ring is going to show up no matter what .but if you have been playing for very short period and you are pressing very hard and you notice that you have very red ring. [CLS] [SEP]you are probably pressing too hard .also although your lips are going to hurt the more you play or ache a little bit .your teeth should never hurt .if you are pressing too hard against the mouthpiece , then your teeth would most likely hurt and that is a good indication .so what you want is just a relaxed tension but not too much .the reason if you think about. [CLS] [SEP]it is simple the lips are muscles and just like any muscle if you are constrict it ca n't do its job .you could imagine it would be very hard to lift something with your biceps if someone is holding your bicep as tight as possible .it is the same thing with your mouth .you want to give it room to do its job .that is how you apply the correct amount of pressure to a mouth piece .
there are two last things that you want to do to give your window a thorough cleaning and one of them .again i 'll just rinse this out in the pine sol water .the water is still getting a little dirty now. [CLS] [SEP]but i am almost done so i 'm not going to bother with having a hole sink full of water. [CLS] [SEP]but you just want to run along the very top .again that is where you are going to get a lot of dust building up right there. [CLS] [SEP]and then also , i 'll just turn the cloth back to front .you want to catch these little toggles that you are touching every single day , every time you open your blinds , every morning and every evening. [CLS] [SEP]so you are going to have some germs on there .so disinfectant is already on my cloth , wipe it clean and then last of all. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm just going to do the very last thing .you are going to open the window. [CLS] [SEP]and it is just this lip that is on the inside of your window .it is between the glass of the outside panel and the inside panel .just this little lip right here , you are going to get the dust that comes through from the outside and goes through your screen and just sits right there at the bottom of the screen. [CLS] [SEP]so just wipe that out .you 're just going to wipe that out with a damp cloth. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 're done .your window is absolutely done .so everything here , probably about 15 minutes to do all of your windows and your blinds but. [CLS] [SEP]it is a job well worth doing because you are not going to do that every week .
in this clip of warrior training , this is a continuation of the other clip , we 're going to go over walking squats which correspond with walking lunges because they both work on the base muscles of the legs , the quadriceps , the gluteus maximus , the hamstrings .the walking squats in warrior training. [CLS] [SEP], we do sideways .with your hands at your side , we squat down to your knees at ninety degrees .we do n't do a ballistic squat .this is a ballistic squat , that puts a lot of pressure in the connective tissue .we go down nice and slow , looking straight ahead , spine straight .i step across. [CLS] [SEP], i step across , exhaling on the way down , inhaling on the way up .again , everything is done slow so as not to injure ourselves .it 's a very good drill after you run , after you bike. [CLS] [SEP]and it conditions again , your quadriceps , gluteus maximus. [CLS] [SEP]and because of the cardio respiratory , your lung capacity also expands .whenever you 're doing these drills , they 're increasing your cardio respiratory which in turn expands the lungs .so again , it 's not just for legs , but it 's for overall conditioning .
you can not love others unless you love yourself .and how do you love yourself .be you man or woman , let 's start from the foundation .oftentimes when we were children , we were put down for a variety of reasons , either through a religious conviction ; we 're guilty about this , we 're guilty about that .it has nothing to do with self .so remove self from that .when you get to the point in your life where you 're an adult , and you look at yourself. [CLS] [SEP]and you say , `` how do i love myself ? ''this may sound almost arrogant .it may sound egotistical .but it works .and we know it works , through various studies .what you do is you walk up to a mirror , and. [CLS] [SEP]i mean like a ceiling to floor mirror , and you look at it. [CLS] [SEP]and you at yourself , be you man or woman , and you look right at yourself and say , `` dr. [CLS] [SEP]paul , you 're the greatest .dr. [CLS] [SEP]paul , you 're the greatest .dr. [CLS] [SEP]paul , you 're the greatest '' .three times .look in that mirror , and you can kiss the mirror .now i know that may sound really off-the-wall to you , but we know that it works .it establishes your feeling of self-worth for you , because you 're telling yourself .oftentimes , self-hypnosis is a matter of telling yourself .and if you can do that , you will convince you because that 's the `` you '' inside .that 's that spirit within , that you have worth .and that 's what it 's all about .and at this point in your life , whatever point it may be , and you 're an adult ; you need to do that .if you have not already established that peace within yourself of that , then there is a technique to use to make it happen .all right ?this is dr. [CLS] [SEP]paul .may your fantasies of today be your realties of tomorrow .
we 're talking about skateboarding parts and maintenance .we 're going to talk about one part of the skateboard , the wheels .a skateboard has 4 wheels 2 in the front and 2 in the front they spin across a fixed axle which is part of a trunk .unlike a car or a bicycle where the wheel moves with the axle on a skateboard , the axle is fixed and the wheel moves around the axle on metal barrings .choosing the right wheel is a very important part of getting started in your skateboard equipment collection .wheels come in different sizes they also come in different widths .you 'll notice this wheel is much wider than this wheel , a wider wheel is more appropriate for ramp and street skating .whereas a thinner wheel is more appropriate for street skating .wheels also come in different hardness .some wheels are very softer thing as other wheels are very hard .a harder wheel is going to make it harder to travel on rough surfaces .a softer wheel is going to make it easier to travel on rough surfaces. [CLS] [SEP]also softer wheels grip the road better , harder wheels tend to slide a lot more .the trick is to find a wheel that has the width that you like the size that you like and also the correct hardness for your skateboard purposes .make sure you pick the wheel that is right for you , attach them to your trucks and you are on your way to be a skateboarder .
after you have your club single throw down pretty clean , where you can take your club in each hand and throw it to the other without really worrying about it , when it just goes where it 's supposed to go .you need to pick up a second club , start working with two .when you start juggling with clubs you ca n't forget everything you 've learned when you start juggling with balls .all the throws have to be the same height , they have to go in the same rhythm. [CLS] [SEP]so it should be throw , throw , catch , catch .you have to hold your posture pretty good , you need to have feet shoulder width apart , bent elbows , standing here naturally , and you want to make sure you 're throwing from the elbow so that it comes across like this .let 's just jump right in .you 're going to grab one club in each hand and start , throw , throw , catch , catch , just like you did when you learned three balls , you 're going to learn this with clubs .each throw has to go across , single spin , and you want to make sure it 's in time so that it 's throw , throw , catch , catch .i want you to practice with both hands , meaning you start with your right hands and then do it with your left first .so it 's left , right , catch , catch , right , left , catch , catch .i want you to try and keep that going as fluidly as possible , right , left , left , right , right , left , left , right .you need to practice that until you do n't really have to think about it until all the spins work out pretty well. [CLS] [SEP]and you need to realize there 's that gap in between the two clubs and. [CLS] [SEP]when we move on , that 's where we 're going to add the third club in .so sit here practicing right , left , left , right , right , left , left ,right , make sure you think about your posture , think about your throws , think about the spin , a lot of things to keep track of , i know , but practice enough and you 'll get it clean .
have you ever wondered about the history of chair massage ?well i 'm going to tell you today .i 'm sundae with natural sundae .now chair massage has been around since the beginning of time basically when massage therapy began , because it 's basically just a form , a portable form of massage , it 's just using a chair .and the first massage chair was actually invented in 1986 and it weighed thirty-six pounds and it came , it was made out of a big , heavy wooden box and it quickly expanded into a chair .however , this proved to be really heavy for the poor therapist who had to lug it around everywhere , and not as comfortable for the clients that were sitting in it .now it took about ten years , but ten years later there was a new version made .it was invented out of metal which made it much lighter for the therapist to carry and much more comfortable for the client to sit in .and of course , with the addition of extra padding and the strategically placed parts on the chair , it made it very , very comfortable to work with and to sit in .so that 's just a very brief history on the , the history of the massage chair , and i hope you 've learned a little bit about it today .i 'm sundae with natural sundae .thanks .
hi i 'm megan milano. [CLS] [SEP]and today i 'm going to teach you how to do a couple of evening. [CLS] [SEP]looks .this is my model alex , and she 's going out with her girlfriends. [CLS] [SEP]so she wants some fun different ideas that she can wear when she goes out .i 'm going to show her some a nice soft yet smoky eye , with a really strong bold lip .and then i 'm going to show her a softer lip , but a more fun eye with a little bit of a brighter color .something that 's way more fun and funky .so let 's get started .
let 's play our e major scale again .scale degree. [CLS] [SEP]no . [CLS] [SEP]1. [CLS] [SEP]is. [CLS] [SEP]e. [CLS] [SEP]now let 's talk about scale degree. [CLS] [SEP]no . [CLS] [SEP]2 , okay , which is f sharp , second finger on the d string .f sharp .between e and f sharp , first scale degree and second scale degree is a whole step .
ask dr. [CLS] [SEP]paul and that 's exactly what we 're doing here .often times people who are in the military have what is called tdy temporary duty .if you 're going to date a military person male or female be prepared to be away from that person for a certain time frames .they may be on temporary duty for six months .they may be in an active combat area .they may have two years to be there with being home after twelve months and then going back .so you have to have that mind set. [CLS] [SEP]and it can be successful that you are going to be committed to this person and really date this person exclusively .do us all a favor .do us a favor as americans .do us a favor as human beings and do yourself and that military person a favor too .please do not write a dear john letter to them .that is devastating .this is dr. [CLS] [SEP]paul .may your fantasies of today be your realities of tomorrow .
and we kind of see it , but let us add more .let us get it like a big maze of confusing things in here .pick a random point .how about right here ?all right , and then we will just start like we did -- like this one , like we just started with this line right here ,right ?just like with a normal box. [CLS] [SEP]and we just kind of went with it ,just kind of went crazy with it , so let us do the same thing .we got ourselves a line .and le us make sure you use them to the vanishing points just like same old , same old .[ indiscernible ] now you are starting to understand that you can pretty much go and do any type of unlimited shapes at this point like and or connect just like building blocks except there is no stuff that hold your back just your imagination .so let us cut this guy off right here. [CLS] [SEP]
with those same people whether the files would be auto or video or even programs .this is what morpheus looks like there is a lot of different things you can do with morpheus aside from just sharing files you can actually create and download and manage pod cast .you can morpheus has built in web browser. [CLS] [SEP]you can browse the web directly through morpheus. [CLS] [SEP]you can it also has a build in media player where you can play the files that you have downloaded .i can create play list which we would get into a little while later .you can also download torrent with morpheus which maybe we would get into a little bit later .like i said morpheus is a great program it uses the net the neo network and netal networks which i would explain to you what those are a little bit later .so the first thing we are going to want to do is download and install morpheus. [CLS] [SEP]so let 's go ahead and do that .
to become a neurosurgeon , first you must become a doctor .to do that , you start by completing a bachelor 's degree at a four year college or university .being that medical school is highly competitive , you 'll really want to focus on keeping your undergraduate gpa above 3.75 , and you 'll want to either major in a science , or complete all of the science prerequisites necessary for medical school .once you have completed your bachelor 's education , you need to take what 's known as the medical college admissions test .all applicants to medical school must take this test , and it covers the physical sciences , biological sciences , verbal reasoning , and written communication .medical schools use your emcat scores , your gpa , course of study , and college you attended , along with other applicant information in assessing candidates to medical school .if they believe you 're a viable candidate , you 'll they will be , they will grant you an interview , which is really a critical step along the process .once you 're admitted to medical school , you begin an additional four year course of study .the first two years of medical school focus primarily on didactic instruction and health sciences , and the second two years focus on teaching clinical knowledge and skills .along the way , you 'll have to pass both parts of the united states license exam , or the usmle , step one , covering your basic knowledge of health science , disease process , and treatment modalities , and step 2 covering your competency in clinical skills .once you 've completed medical school you 'll be granted the degree of md , but before you can practice as a neurosurgeon , you will have to apply for a neurosurgery residency .now , neurosurgery is one of the disciplines that has their own residency program , as opposed to the national match .you will apply to a residency program in neurosurgery much as you did to medical school , and once you are accepted , you will begin a an additional six to eight years of graduate medical education , which , during which you will first learn how to become a surgeon , and then , how to become specifically a neurosurgeon .given that neurosurgery or surgery on the brain is a very complex and technical process , it is a very arduous residency program .but upon completing your residency in neurosurgery , you can sit for the state board exam in the state in which you wish to practice , and you will be ready to practice medicine as a neurosurgeon .
now i 'll teach you some more sport signs .hockey .hockey .rink .skating .or skating rink .ice skating .goal .goal .helmet .helmet .puck .puck .the next sport is soccer .soccer .goal or goalie .scrimmage .scrimmage .kick .kick .wrestling .wrestling .wrestling match .tennis .tennis .tennis court .tennis match .good job !practice those signs .
hey guys , so now that you 've learned some jazz , funk routines , some different steps , i 'm going to put it together for you in a combination and say farewell . [CLS] [SEP]thank you for watching expert village , i 'm courtney tracht and here we go .
the next exercise i 'm going to demonstrate is the biceps curl .this is a great exercise both standing or seated .but , again try to resist the temptation of a fixed plain movement pattern like a preacher curl type position getting your arms over the top of something to try to isolate .no muscle in the body works in an isolation type position .so , again always the opportunity to do things in a full bodied type functional pattern .so , some of the things that people do that always go wrong .again , just always in this little box we like to live in .rotating forward , collapsing the body .bringing lots of tension into the neck .instead , just like the triceps pull down push down roll your shoulders back .hinge your hips back slightly .pull the abdominal wall in .think about as you curl the weight up , squeezing the muscles you 're trying to use .biceps , definitely using the triceps as well .definitely keeping the shoulder blades back .and , then do n't forget to lengthen the arms all the way back out .final and most importantly ,breathe .exhale , inhale to come all the way back to the starting position .same exercise from the side , biceps curl .slightly hinging back .it does n't mean i need to squat .i 'm just in an athletic ready position .ready to go .ready to biceps curl .exhale to come up .inhale back .be very aware of your shoulders wanting to roll forward .so , just keep them rolling back .draw the stomach in .exhale , inhale to stretch .
what we want to talk about now is the player ?s. [CLS] [SEP]responsibilities in the zone defense .what we want to concentrate now is on this zone defender on the bottom outside .and he has a couple of different responsibilities .obviously , as the ball enters into his particular area , he 's going to have to worry about coming out and playing me .now , if this guy is a post player , or a non-shooter , then what we want this guy to do is not to step all the way out to the corner , but at least give me some respect that if i shoot and this guy starts making shots , then we want to close out on him .if this is a shooter though , we want this guy to come running out and close out on the defender so that he 's here .this guy then becomes a help to reverse the ball , and you see that our bottom man that 's in the middle has come over to help on the low block .but it 's this guy 's responsibility .once the ball moves into his area , then he 's got to make sure and come out and play that ball .if i start to drive , then he 's got me basically one-on-one .or , until i get out of his zone , then he can relax and sag back down .but once that ball enters his area , that guy 's got to come out , and his commitment is to get out to the ball .also , when the ball comes down here , if my bottom side defender can come all the way out -- come on out -- then we can dribble into a trap .if we get it right here. [CLS] [SEP]and this guy steps in and pulls the ball up , we can trap right there as well .so those are a couple things we do with that bottom side defender in the zone .
we 're here to talk about tooth whitening .tooth whitening previously was coined as bleaching .what we do in tooth whitening , one of the main things is we want to be allowed to have the enamel of our teeth to be lightened .the enamel is consist of the outer structure of the tooth .and on the inner part of the tooth is the top portion is called the dentin and the bottom portion , the root is called a samenton. [CLS] [SEP]but really they are pretty much the same structure .the difference is that the inner part of two structures are very porous , so solution , air , any type of molecule can pass through back and forth .but the enamel itself , it ?s the hardest structure on this planet and. [CLS] [SEP]at the same time it 's basically , there is no communication between the outside and the inside .simply nothing can pass through from the outside to the inside .
now , we 're going to take a look at the b major chord .now , just to reiterate , the major chord is made up of the first , third and fifth notes of a major scale .in the scale b , you have b as the root , then you have a c sharp as the second , a d sharp as the third , an e as the fourth , and a f sharp as the fifth .so , we need a b , d sharp and a f sharp to make this chord .now , let 's look at the ukulele here , let 's start with the g string .it 's not going to do us much good. [CLS] [SEP]but if we go up a whole step to a and a whole step to b , there 's are root .the next string we have is a c if we go up to d , up another half step to d sharp , there 's our third .then we got the e string , go up a whole step , there 's our f sharp .now , we have b , d sharp ,f sharp .now the high string is an a string .go up a whole step , there 's another b.so , if we play all those together , we have b , d sharp , f sharp , b. [CLS] [SEP]play them all together and that will yield you a b major chord .
so the day before your move you 're going to want to make final arrangements for things or just check in on arrangements that you 've made , for instance , the arrangements that you 've made for your pets .so i 'll be taking my cat over to my parent ’ s house tonight so that she can stay there. [CLS] [SEP]and she wo n't be in the way of the move. [CLS] [SEP]and she 'll be safer there and wo n't have to be in a little bitty cage all day .so , and if you had planned to take your cat to the vet or take them to a kennel , or your dog , or whatever kind of animal you have , then the day before is obviously your last chance to go ahead and finalize those arrangements and execute the arrangement .so also some other people that you 'll want to check in with are the friends and family that said they would help you , so you 'll want to call them and make sure that they will be there .or the movers , some movers will call you to confirm the reservation , if they do n't then it never hurts for you to call them .check in about any rental equipment that you have rented just to make sure .so these are all things that are good to do the day before or. [CLS] [SEP]maybe the day or two before you move .
now , we 're going to go over our solfege , comparing it to the g major scale .okay .so , solfege , if you do n't know already , is ,i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]sure everybody has heard the song with do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do , okay , those are our eight degrees .do is 1 and so forth .so let 's try it .do is g , re , mi , fa , so , la , ti , do , back to do .this is our solfege .remember , it 's do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do .
our table saw comes with two very nifty features .one of those features is adjustable depth of cut .at the bottom of the table you will notice two wheels .the depth of cut wheel will lower and raise your blade above the surface of the table .on the left hand side of the machine there is this other wheel , and this wheel will allow you to tip the blade .thus create something that is called the bevel cut .a little scale located at the bottom will allow you to see exactly how many degrees you are tilting the blade of the table .and this will conclude the nifty features of the delta cutting saw .
hi , this is yolanda from vanveenbulbs.com , and in this segment we 're going to talk about how to dig a flower bed .now , we all have grassy areas in our yard , and we would like to have more flower beds , but we do n't know how to start , and what to do .but basically to dig a flower bed is just like it sounds .it 's just to dig out the grass , put some compost in its place , and then you have a new flower bed that 's ready to go .i 'll show ya !so when you 're digging out grass you 've got ta use a lot of pressure , so i just kind of work its , work its way down .and a lot of times it 's just been raining for the last two weeks , so. [CLS] [SEP]the ground 's a little bit softer .in the middle of the summer , it 's really hard .so , if the ground is really hard , or if you live somewhere where there 's lots of clay and rocks and you just ca n't dig in , then i would make a raised bed and just forget it , cause you 're never going to dig it out .but this ground is really soft , so , and especially since it 's just rained , so i can dig out a little bit of the grass .now these pieces of grass are still good , too , so if you have little spots that you need to fill in , you can always use that grass to fill it in or even start some more grassy areas. [CLS] [SEP]that , where the grass is n't doing well ,or you just want it to look good .and if not , i can just throw it in my compost pile , and it 'll break down really nicely .so i like to throw it right into a garbage can or a wheelbarrow right away , so that i can use it .but you just kind of keep working yourself around , and sometimes just jumping a little bit on it. [CLS] [SEP]helps a lot too .you just take a little bit at a time .so it is , it can be time consuming ,but i just like. [CLS] [SEP]my little fencepost and my designated wildlife habitat area ,and i want to make a little more of a flower bed around it .so , i 'm just going to dig it out a little bit at a time .a lot of times you just kind of have to work your way all the way around , too .but you 'll find , in a little bit of time , that you 've , you know , doubled the size of the bed that quickly .and i just keep working my way around in a circle and digging out a flower bed .and it 's really simple .and once the bed 's dug out , i 'll just throw some compost in where the grass was , and once i have a little flower bed , i just can put some rocks around it , or some wood around it , and i 'll have a nice flower bed overnight , and it 's that easy .it takes a little bit of work , but digging out a flower bed is really rewarding .
what i 'm going to show you how to do now is to add more crinkle to a crinkle crochet .what we have here is a. [CLS] [SEP]; i mean a crinkled up scrunchie that is already done for one level .i 'm going to show you how you can add more kink to it with your second row .so , you 're going to take your yarn .wrap it around your finger .find the pretzel shape .grab your yarn right there and pull .we have our first loop on our needle .what you 're going to do is instead of going directly underneath the chains we 're going to work in between our columns .so , stick your needle through any column that you choose .we 're just going to go ahead and attach it real quick .we 're going to pull our yarn through it and then pull our yarn through those two loops .there we go .we have our yarn started on our new ; on our new level with our new color .because we 're going to use the double crochet all the way around. [CLS] [SEP]we 're going to chain up one and up two , because we 're going to use the double crochet .now , what we 're going to do is we 're going to use our double crochet pattern ; remember loop our piece of yarn and around it .go underneath , pull it through and then pull yarn through your first two loops and pull yarn through your second two loops .what 's going to make this crinkle up more is that in each hole , or you can do it in every other hole or every two holes ; whatever you decide , but we 're going to add extra columns .so , with our loop like this we 're going to wrap it around again to start a double crochet , but. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to go between the same two columns .i 'm going to pull my yarn through to get my three .pull it through and pull it through .now , what this is going to do is this is going to literally just add more yarn to this piece and. [CLS] [SEP]because we 're doing that it 's going to wave up even more .it 's already crinkled because of how we made it on our first row , but by adding more columns into our second row however many is your choice , it 's going to make it crinkle up more .so , just as you go into each ; between each new column you just want to make sure you do more than one .you can do it as many or as few times as you want , but by adding extra columns in between your columns. [CLS] [SEP]and you see it 's still flat right now ,but as we work along you 'll see it start to crinkle up more and more as you continue to add .
a hitch is a classic way to secure something to a solid object , post , hitching post .it 's really a classic way to things .so , if you look down here , you can see i have my makeshift hitch post. [CLS] [SEP]and i 've got my line .know this is called a pedigree hitch , a simple hitch .what we are going to do is we are going to take our line .we are going to run it underneath. [CLS] [SEP]or actually we are going to run it over and underneath .so this way you can see the knot a lot better .we 'll take it and we 'll loop it over like this .you can see that we have a loop here. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm just looping it over .pull it out a little bit more because i 'm going to need it .i 'm going to take it back under and loop it over again .as you can see i 've got this symmetrical almost butterfly shape going on too .as i pull it to tighten it up , i 'm going to take my working end again. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to run it under both lines creating a loop around my initial line that i put in here .just pulling it tight , this is a nice secure hitch and as you can see as i pull on .my horse is definitely not pulling loose from this one .
now i 'm going to help johnny demonstrate the sideward leg push while i 'm pushing his leg .so he lean against the wall ,his hand 's above his head , okay .his other hand are in .his leg straight .i 'm going to push his leg as high as i could .okay , go higher johnny ?yeah .okay .exhale .relax .now touch your toes , okay .good .count to five .one , two , three , four , five .now let 's switch legs .okay , same thing .one , two , three , four , and five .ladies and gentlemen , this concludes the sideward leg push. [CLS] [SEP]
now let 's play our scale once again .( playing violin )e natural , f sharp , g natural , a natural , b natural , c sharp , d sharp now let 's go over our eighth scale degree which is the same note as our first scale degree. [CLS] [SEP]it 's an e natural. [CLS] [SEP]but this time it 's played with our fourth finger on the a string , take a look .( playing violin ) between d sharp our seventh scale degree and e natural , our eighth scale degree is a half step .because between scale degrees number seven and eight is always a half step in a melodic minor scale .
so i already lined this up as top here , this being bottom .so if i work with some young people and they had a choice of wood , decided and then they will probably ask me , what do i think ?how are we going to work this ?so usually i go for my own past experienced. [CLS] [SEP], i usually go for my same style that i had been doing , i probably start with the hair down here somewhere off on the side .take my faithful magic markers .so i go with this crack here , start my hairline way down here somewhere .come up top , give them a kind of hoody around the side for his hairline .he or she .one interesting thing is i was set up one time and since then came up and said , oh all your pieces got mustaches and beards , how come there is no female pieces ?you know they all look so masculine .that was a quiet few years ago so. [CLS] [SEP], i took her hint and did a unisex from here on out , no mustaches ,no beard , they can be male , they can be female unless i put a male and female together , then i got to make a little distinction of the beard or something .if i am just doing one face , usually you wo n't see a mustache or a beard anywhere and draw the net , the original humans , draw the net .so , that is what we got , that is kind of a critical there and that kind of lays everything else out .
hi my name is lauren and today i 'm here to discuss haircuts for thick curly hair .the curlier your hair is , the longer in length you maybe want to keep on your hair .the longer your length is , the more weight it has in order to weigh your curl down .if you have a very kinky curl , you pretty much have two options when it comes to haircuts .you can either keep it very long and add some layers in order to remove bulk or you can make it very short .anything bob length , unless your straightening your hair everyday can tend to look triangular .a good way for stylist and even for yourself to actually go through and texturize your hair would be to actually pick your hair up with its curl , turn your hair and then use one of your scissors. [CLS] [SEP]; you 're actually with the curl .so you 're going to cut into your little cylinder here of your hair ; but you 're going to use your natural curl in order to form .you 're going to cut into it and then comb it out .you want to be careful also with thick curly hair , that you 've really want to keep your concentration on the ends .all of your texturizing should be done on the ends .anything too close to the root. [CLS] [SEP]and you may wind up going out. [CLS] [SEP]rather they 're in down .if you 'd like to soften your hair , you soften it more towards the ends of your hair shaft , rather than towards the root and just keep your length and keep some weight .you can speak with your stylist and discuss the proper hairstyle for your face shape and which will compliments you best .and that is stylist for curly hair .
so , this is how i would do it .we 're going to , we 're going to make kind of like matchsticks of the pepper .we 're going to cut off the top and the bottom .and you want to clean the inside .let 's take this .this is a nice-looking knife for this purpose .slice it down , and i 'm going to open up the pepper .and in order to clean the ribs out of it. [CLS] [SEP]it 's good to break it into segments , so i 'll do that .and lets , this knife is nice and sharp also .and very easily we can slice out our , our ribs .that looks a little thick so i 'm going to slice that down .and this one has some rib too and some seeds .and let 's make it into matchsticks .just like that .make them nice and thin .i think that one 's a little too thick , slice it again .one more section .it is such heaven to work with a sharp knife .i sharpen my knives before i use them every single day .okay , there we go .and when we come back we 're going to start to saute our pork .
on a 3 count , 1 , 2 , and 3.in real time .2 punches .1 , 2 , low kick .there you go .
okay , there 's a phenomenon known in pool that is termed , `` squirt '' .squirt is a pool players jargon meaning deflection .in this case , it 's deflection on the cue ball .we 're deflecting the cue ball off of its natural line of aim .and , the way that squirt happens is when you go trying to use any english , whether it be left or right , using english with a forceful stroke .in other words , if i had this setup here again .and , i 'm trying to shoot the ball straight down to that piece of chalk ,but i 'm going to use english. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm even going to be use a level cue so that we 're not curving the cue ball off line. [CLS] [SEP], we want to send it straight .but , i 'm going to use english with a forceful shot .let 's take a look and see what happens here .i 'm going to line up for left hand english , meaning the left side of the ball , and i 'm going to aim directly towards the piece of chalk. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to hit this hard .did you see where the ball hit ?it did n't go to the piece of chalk , it came over here , far to the right of the chalk as i 'm looking at it .that 's what we call squirt .why do we have to know about that ?because we have to be aware of what might happen when we have a shot where we have to hit it with some force for purposes of pocketing our ball , moving the cue ball around the table , but we also have to use english for controlling the angle in and out of the cushions .but , we have to hit it hard , we have to realize that we might squirt that ball off line .therefore we have to be able to adjust for our aim .to adjust because of the squirt action that we 're going to get , so that we make sure we come back and hit the exact contact point on our object ball that we 're looking for .
grab the finger or toe in the bent position , and align the bones as they normally align by sliding them over and putting them back in place .this is going to cause a great deal of discomfort and pain .afterwards , knowing there is damage that has been done to the joint by stretching ligaments and tendons , it would be advisable to take that finger or toe and splint it , or tape it to the digit next to it until the healing process has been complete .i 'm captain joe bruni .stay safe , and we 'll see ya ' next time .
so , i decided to include his camera in the image .and , if you look closely , you can see in the reflection of his glasses , the image that he was actually trying to capture on film .now , this portrait is an example of how you can show somebody and kind of depict what type of person they are or what kinds of things. [CLS] [SEP]they 're interested in by positioning different objects around them .and again , always pay attention to what the person 's eyes are doing or what 's being reflected on whatever might be covering their eyes , kind of giving the viewer an idea of what they might be looking at .now , i worked with this model and she really wanted to do some full length portraits .so i found that having her in this chair , it created a nice relaxed feel and , at the same time , it showed off her wardrobe and the length that she works with .i believe she was well over six feet tall .but this is just an example of how a full length portrait can show you a little bit more than a head shot and really bring a lot into the image .so again , when you 're taking portraits , go ahead and experiment with head shots , different angles , various objects related to the head shots .but do n't be afraid to try some full length portraits as well and see what you might get there .
and i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]a professional dog trainer in austin , texas .you can visit my website at trainmydogs.com .today we are going to talk to you about water introduction .one of the most important parts about this experience for a dog is that it is a positive one .so we 've come to a place where you can just kind of walk out into the water .lexie , good girl , good girl .so i 'm going to call my dog to come towards me. [CLS] [SEP]but really i do n't want to do a lot of talking. [CLS] [SEP]but really i do n't want to do a lot of talking. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm just going to walk around and let her frolic around .it really helps for her to have friends that are here with her that know how to swim .so bugsy , good girl ,good job .if your dog is confident in the water you can talk to them all you want .if they 're feeling a little bit shy , a little bit nervous when you talk to them they have a tendency to run out so. [CLS] [SEP]try not to talk to them if they 're feeling nervous about being in the water but rather just walking back and forth and getting them used to the area .i 'm going to try to entice bugsy to play with the ball .it got stolen .good job ,ready bugs ready ?look at that we 've got a swimmer .good girl , good job .swimming is great exercise for your dog .it is low impact on the hips and joints and just fabulous when you are in a place like austin , texas. [CLS] [SEP]so the best thing to do is find a spot that you can go out and just walk out that it gradually gets deeper enticing your puppy if they are confident to come out and join you .this is how you would introduce water to your dogs .
or , you could also get some other type of injury .you also want to make sure that work area is well lit .it is very hard to work in the dark .you also want to make sure that you are not working in any type of an explosive atmosphere .if you are using the belt sander , and you hit a nail , it could cause sparks to fly off which could ignite anything explosive .and , lastly , you want to make sure and keep anyone that 's watching at a safe distance so that you can properly use your tool without the possibility of them getting injured .
what if this hand , here , were your hand ?it 's a hand where you need to be able to avoid taking the queen of spades .okay ?the hand , the reason i say that , is because this hand contains these spades and no other spades .and it would be even worse to just have these two spades , but it contains the three highest spades that are not the queen .and , there are only three spades. [CLS] [SEP]so we know that there are nine out there that are not the queen .so it 's likely whomever has the queen of spades also has another spade , so they 're in a good position to dump it on someone else rather than having to take it themselves .so , what do you do ?well , the first thing i would do , and there are a number of strategies , and it takes playing to learn them all .but , first thing i would do is , when clubs are led , i 'm going to have the choice between this four , this seven , or this ten .well , forget about the seven .i can either go low or go high .well , what i 'm going to do , is i 'm going to throw this ten and hope that nobody throws nothing higher than a ten .and then , i 'm going to play my lowest diamond , or my second lowest diamond .and what i 'm going to hope is that someone , like say the person to the left of me does n't have a diamond , or has a high diamond .i 'm sorry .i 'm going to hope the person to the left of me. [CLS] [SEP]has a high diamond. [CLS] [SEP]and then the person who has the queen of spades does not have a diamond. [CLS] [SEP]and then they dump it there. [CLS] [SEP]and i have avoided the queen of spades .that 's one way to do it , you will learn others as you play .
but they forget about some of them when they are going on the road .so i mean when you are at the airport on the plane , wasting time , even at the hotel in between the gigs that is when you use your personal entertainment devices like let 's say you have a smart media phone or a mp3 player or the new smart media players which play video and audio .those things are a great tools to have i even recorded my own concerts with my video camera .even the phones these days are like my phone here is a smart media phone it has a video ,mp3 , it has to video cards in it , it has memory so it does n't matter where i am if i want to kill time or get some entertainment. [CLS] [SEP]then i could use my phone or my device to entertain me .when you are in the road and there is a lot of minutes where there is plan. [CLS] [SEP]oh bed time where you can use this time for your devices and give your self a break .
this is a little more complex because you 've got to make sure your anchor points are perfectly level with each other otherwise your mirror will be slanted and there 's not a whole lot of room for error on this one .so the first thing we want to do is we want to measure the distance between the two anchor points .so , i 'm going to get my tape measure. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll measure from one anchor point to the other .and this one just happens to be 24 inches .i 'm going to be using these 50 pound anchors. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's a bit of overkill for the weight of this mirror. [CLS] [SEP]but i 'm just going to add a little more strength to our anchor there .so i 've decided that i want my anchor point to be right at about 70 inches .so i 'm going to get my tape measure and measure up 70 inches and put a mark .now depending on where i want it on the wall , i wanted the center of the mirror to be right here. [CLS] [SEP]so we 're 24 inches. [CLS] [SEP], the mirror is 24 inches wide so. [CLS] [SEP]from this mark i need to move over 12 inches this way and 12 inches the other way .and i 'll have two marks and that will give me the 24 inches that i need .so for my center mark , i 'm going to get my level and put it right on the mark at the right height. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to draw just a real light pencil line .one over here about where 12 inches is and one on the other end .now i 'm going to get my tape measure. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to measure over 12 inches .i 'm going to put a mark. [CLS] [SEP]and then 12 inches the other way. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to put a mark there .and then just to double check myself. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to measure from one point to the other .and it should be 24 inches , and it is .now i 'm going to take my anchors and this anchor , the nail is actually a bit higher than where the mirror is going to attach to it. [CLS] [SEP]so i want to make sure that the bottom of the anchor is going to be on my mark .so i 'm going to put my safety glasses on .any time i use my hammer i 'm going to use these .and we 're going to nail in my first anchor .and now for the second anchor .and there we go. [CLS] [SEP], we have our mirror hung .it 's plum and level. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's exactly where we want it to be .
and we are making etched glass .we 're doing a picture frame .and i have my pattern right here already placed on the picture frame , and now i 'm going to tack it down with some tape .and i 'm just taking some regular masking tape , and kind of ripping it into smaller strips .and this is just to tack it down a little , just so it 'll stay in place .this way it stays right where i want it as we 're rubbing it off , rubbing the stencil off onto our glass .and this is just regular masking tape .masking tape works well because it does n't leave a residue , it comes up easy .these two we 'll just kind of tape together .there we go .and now we 're ready to rub our stencil onto the glass .
( airbrushing )now this orange blend is not going to exact going to the original orange and it does not need to be because this is wood grain .what you see here is just anything of what the product looks like. [CLS] [SEP]and i do n't know about you. [CLS] [SEP]but i never seen anything wood that look exactly the same as the next piece. [CLS] [SEP]so do n't worry about it .different is better .you do n't want it to look like cookie cutter same thing over and over that makes it look fake .do n't forget to heat set it .okay. [CLS] [SEP]i think this is good for now stay tune for our next segment when we are going to throw down some color .
now , if you are that type of person who gets the migraine , in spring or in winter and especially in the morning or evening , and if gets worse if you bend your head down , then aruwait suggest that you very simply take a bowl of boiling water add five drops of eucalyptus oil and simply inhale .if you do n't have any eucalyptus oil add some freshly cut ginger to the boiling water .inhale and watch the migraine disappear .the other thing you could do is , to buy some dried ginger powder from any indian store .take about less the one fourth teaspoon , add a little bit of water to make a smooth paste and apply it over your forehead , leave for half hour and then very gently , carefully so as to not sting the eyes wash your forehead .and see the difference , your migraine would have become lessened or would have gone .
now we 're going to look at the growing and the care of your geranium in your garden .your geranium needs sun , and lots of it .when you move inland , your geranium can perform quite well in filtered light , let 's say underneath a tree .it would need about four to five , to even six hours of scattered light to have it bloom .this plant comes from a mediterranean climate , which means that if you live in an area of the world that freezes during the winter time , you must protect this sweet little plant from a frost .you can either mulch it , you can cone it , you can move it indoors to a greenhouse or your home .you can move it close to your home , underneath the tree , but do protect it from the frost .when you water your geranium try to keep all of the water off of the leaves , and when you water , remember to water early in the morning or in the late afternoon .now the early europeans found many different reasons for this wonderful growing , colorful perennial in your garden .now , you can use this for scents , perfumes , oils , food preparation , and some even said that this sweet perennial deters mosquitoes .what a wonderful , colorful addition to anyone 's garden .
the next thing we are going to look at is what we call the hand , finger and grip strengtheners .i have a set here .these basically are used for strengthening not only the fingers but your hands , your wrist , even your forearms , your shoulders , everything .and you 'll get a good little workout with everything on it .but you can use these for strengthening your hands for work on a speed bag later for work on a heavy bag .it will help in your jump roping .it 's going to be a good all-around exercise .very simple to use of course .but the thing is you should try to do it in like maybe the two minute increments. [CLS] [SEP]like we do everything else in .a good place to use these is on the floor step upstairs , where you are actually stepping up and down the stairs .each step you can just take an alternating grip on each one .you can use them while you are shadow boxing , and as you throw the jab you can actually squeeze them .you can use them when you are doing , you know , sit-ups .each time you come up you can squeeze them .so there 's a multitude of times you can actually use them .one of the other better times to use them is when you are taking a break .if you are taking a break , you know , in between maybe a ten round increment working on thirty rounds. [CLS] [SEP]and you are watching what else is going on in the gym .you can actually relax and sit down for a minute or whatever .get on the stationary bike ; watch what is going on in the gym .trying to learn some other things from other boxers and at the same time you are still getting your own workout .
in this clip we 're going to do a review of the couple of the steps that we just went over .so , the first step , remember , the drummer tells you when to go , when to stop and when to give a solo .king , king , king , king .and again , and we 're going to move to the next step , king , king , king , king .and stop .
okay , now i 'm going to show the leaders roll and the side by side charleston stomp on five .i 'll demonstrate it first , one , two , three , four , five .one , two , three , four , five , one , two , three , four , five. [CLS] [SEP], that 's from the side .from the back side , one , two , three , four , five , one , two , three , four , five .okay ,so , the key here as making a variation between a regular charleston side by side , is normally , the key is the four , so , normally we would go one , two , three , four , five , four would kind of stop , keep you nice and grounded so we can kind of stop the momentum and kick on five .in this move we 're going one , two , three , four. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're propelling forward and taking a nice low stance into the ground .okay , in an earlier series we talked about the skips forward that had a similar kind of propelling sensation on the four ,in that move it was kind of a one , two , three , four and after the four it was an upward momentum on five with a scoop and a skip .here is that same forward progression , but instead of taking that momentum up. [CLS] [SEP]we 're taking it down .so , the follower needs to feel both that forward progression and the fact that we 're going nice and low to hit that thub .okay , just to demonstrate that one more time , one , two , three , four , five , notice how i 'm propelling through here on the five , and i 'm really settling in with my weight following on my right foot .one , two , three , four , five making sure to take the follower with us by having a nice solid connection in the side by side .
s called adverse the on , the plane wants to , the nose of the plane wants to turn opposite the direct we are turning .we need to add that right rudder .and a little back pressure to compensate for the loss of lift .and continue turning around about thirty degrees .okay ?alright .
you could choose either method .you can even paint different colors , pre-paint different colors , and then you can put them all together. [CLS] [SEP]so you can make a pattern like blue , blue-green , white , and red , and then you start it all over again .it 's good fun with the kids because it can teach them the colors .you can even play counting games with your kids while doing this , and you can also make different patterns .it 's quite good for their memory and also for the concentration span , for how long they can actually follow a certain pattern .and if you have all the kids , then you can make these patterns a bit more difficult , so you can actually put same colors with same colors and different colors .let 's wait until this side dries , and when it 's dried , you can just turn it all over again and paint the other side .
next we 're going to be going over how you do around the leg , alright .so round leg 's going to go to look like this. [CLS] [SEP], you go around the head , you go up , around and then right through the leg and back to starting position , alright .so , now how we go about going around the leg , first when you go , you want to be able to hold your balance. [CLS] [SEP]and you put your body flat .o.k , now as you do it , you 're going to be coming around with your left hand , that 's going to be going , that 's going to swing all the way around your leg , come through here and then come back up , bam , all the way to here or into a strike ,o.k .so , one more time , you can do your strike , one , two , three , four , come across , one , two , three , four , go around the head .which this one looks really nice or a palm spin , go flat ,o.k , you 're going to hit your leg. [CLS] [SEP], go around your leg , there you go all the way here .so , looking fast , one , two , three , four , one , two , three , four , above the head , around the leg , hi-ya , all the way to here .chuk kunya .alright , so that 's going to be how to go around your leg .and that one 's going to take some practice also , but it 's a really cool move and it looks neat , especially if you get it really fast above the head , around the leg .o.k , one thing you also want to make sure is , when you hold it , you do n't want to hold it too low. [CLS] [SEP]cause if do that , it 's going to fall short and you 're not going to get it. [CLS] [SEP], o.k .you want to hold it about over here , so when you swing it , it 's got plenty of length on the bo to get all the way around your leg. [CLS] [SEP]balanced .o.k , if it 's off. [CLS] [SEP]balance. [CLS] [SEP]you might lose it or it 'll get hung up on your leg .
i 'll show you .you walk in , confident , you might say , `` hi , '' to the audition people .you definitely go up to the accompanist first , speak to the accompanist , tell the accompanist what you need and come over and show them that you 're ready .they may ask you what you 're singing. [CLS] [SEP]and you can say , `` i 'm singing ' i will survive ' , '' or they may not and in that case you do n't need to tell them .but the important thing is to come in with confidence , do n't overdo it , they can see through that , but come in , be yourself ; be confident , make eye contact , be pleasant .and you know what , a little trick i like to think of before i go. [CLS] [SEP]and i think ,i kinda jump up and down , and i think , `` ah .i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]having the best day !i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]having the best day !i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]having the best day of my life ! ''and then i come in with lots of energy .i just come in , `` hi ! ''have fun .come in and really have fun with energy , direction , look them in the eye , be sweet .
so again , from the technique , once i 've done my technique , i take the person down , i pull them away from their center , controlling them down .once he 's on his back like this , i have to move him over .he 's got too many weapons right now to attack me with .he can kick me , he can punch me , he can bite my ankle , and i do n't want that .so what i do is , holding his wrist. [CLS] [SEP], i take my hand at his elbow , i cross step. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm not leaving my groin exposed .i cross step , take the elbow at his face , as i take his hand in a circular motion down by his belt .that forces the body to turn over because the shoulder wo n't move this way .the most effective way to pin any person , any human being , is to jam their shoulder into the mat .if i pin his hips , if i pin his head , he can get out of this technique .but if i lock his shoulder into the ground , he wo n't be able to get out of this .so once i 've rolled him over , what i do is , take my foot , i base it up against his leg , or i 'm sorry up against his arm , just like this , so his arm is resting on the inside of my knee .i 'm like in a horse stance now , and i push his wrist into the ground .effectively pinning the shoulder .you push on the wrist , but you 're jamming the shoulder into the ground .as i lean this more towards his head , you 'll see him tap. [CLS] [SEP], that 's a submission .just like this .after i 'm done pinning , i just slide his arm down my shin , and i stand behind him , bracing his arm up against my shin , with this wrist lock on it .if he starts to get up from here , i can just put the wrist lock right back on him to control him .this is what i consider the after-action drill of this technique .move away from him at this point .if you just get in the habit of putting someone down .doing the pin , go ahead and do the pin , and just letting go and walking away , he can grab your legs .so i always pin the person , and then control them after the pin .
here 's a style of defending yourself against multiple opponents if you 're surprised from the side or from behind .you want to use your shoulders to defend yourself .and these are more rushing style or wavy arm punches , but you can generate a lot of power and also defend yourself with your arms if you 're attacked by many opponents or in a crowd .so if my attacker comes from the side here , i 'm going to defend with my shoulder .lift my shoulder , tuck my chin .so i might take it in the face a little bit , but i 'm not getting knocked out with the sucker punch .and then i go right into my strike .so if he throws here , he 's trapped , i go to my back fist , my arm punch here and come back to the bag or other opponents .you can go quickly from one opponent to the next .and my arms are defending myself as i go .if i show between the bags just to demonstrate .if he 's behind me , i take out the first guy. [CLS] [SEP]and then i go behind .chop this way , you can blast the guy and come back .there 's a lot of power in these overhand type strikes or forearm type strikes .against the bag .as my arms move and shoulders are coming up they 're here .see how my head 's always covered .i 'm moving here , back fist , punch ,i 'm blocking my head , it weaves over my head back fist .punch , stepping in .the arms are waving around my head if i 've got all kinds of guys swarming around me .i 'm taking them out .i 'm baring my head. [CLS] [SEP]maybe i 'm not even seeing that much , i 'm getting hit from all angles .but i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]defending my chin , i 'm not getting knocked out .defending , weaving the arms , going into other techniques and then going to the next opponent .if i 'm just here. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]defending it .it 's very strong .rotating your hips , whipping your arms with full power .the important thing is how my arms are up defending my face .so that 's a way of multiple opponent punching , if you 're surrounded by multiple opponents .
once this is enclosed the air is trapped between. [CLS] [SEP]and i could work on this now .
flip it over and slide a bobby pin right there .then just flip the hair over and you do n't see the bobby pin it. [CLS] [SEP]completely just hide. [CLS] [SEP]but it secures your wig on. [CLS] [SEP]and it just feel a lot better for me .then i do the same thing to the other side and just grab it , flip it over , slide the bobby pin in there , flip it back it down .you can see that you are not going to see the bobby pin. [CLS] [SEP]so know one is going to be able to tell what you have done .it would hold it and make it really secure for you .
now hopefully when learning three balls , you learned a pattern that i call a `` pattern stack '' , high , middle , low , but is also notated as 5 , 3 , 1.if you can not do this trick , you do n't want to try the four-ball version .the four ball version is the same thing , but now you 're going to add an extra high throw .in site swaps this would be. [CLS] [SEP]a 7 so the full pattern would be 7 , 5 , 3 , 1.now , this is what it looks like .now on the other side .now as you can see , i 'm attempting to throw the balls up in the air in a way that they all fall at the same time .because of their height , i 'm given enough space to recover into the base pattern , whatever that is .now you can do it continuously on one side , or by adding a pattern stall , a four , 7 , 5 , 3 , 1 , 4 , you can switch sides without ever breaking the pattern .now this trick is very challenging .you have many different height throws and have to maintain a good rhythm to maintain the trick .i suggest working on getting it down on each side just once with a cold stop , very solid before trying to move on .remember short controlled runs helps , body posture and good balance helps .for all the drills and all the tricks in this series and in future ones , try to keep that in mind as it really will help .good luck !
the next step we have here is to find a bucket .this is a professional window washing bucket .it works great because you can have a long sponge and stick it in there without having a whole lot of water in the bucket .that is why they are elongated like that .second if you are just doing this around the house and you want something to use , i just got this from home depot , any old bucket will do .the problem you find with some of these buckets if you are trying to get your sponge wet , sometimes you have to stick it in one side and dip it in the other. [CLS] [SEP]and that is why these other buckets are handy .and this bucket i have is what i keep my equipment in .you an pick this up at a cleaning supply store for $ 15 to $ 20 .it has a spot for your sponge and a spot for your squeegee and you can put two or three different size squeegees in there .if you are going to be doing this full time professionally , you definitely want to invest in something like this .
and it looks like this .he is going to attack with a shomen strike , and i 'm going to move out of the way by passing his strike , grabbing the wrist in a shiho nage hold , coming underneath , and bringing him down to the floor .again uke strikes , i grab his strike and bring him down , and i finish by pinning his arm .in real time it goes like this .
so , the drones that are up over my shoulder here are tuned to the chanter .the two tenor drones are tuned one octave below the low a on the chanter , and the bass drone here is tuned two octaves below the low a on the chanter .there is n't much of an adjustment on these tubes , lengthening the tube flattens the pitch , makes the tube longer , therefore a lower pitch .shortening the tubes slightly increases the pitch , makes it a slightly a higher pitch .but ultimately , it 's a very small range of movement that changes the pitch of these pipes in order to tune them to the bottom note on the chanter .with the bass drone , you generally always leave the top of it set so that there 's just a little bit of the hemp line showing and. [CLS] [SEP]the bottom joint here is where you make your changes on tuning the bass drone .
inner thigh is another very easy relaxing posture .bring your feet up and put your feet together and let your heels come in .you try to hold on to those toes. [CLS] [SEP]but if that is difficult for you , move your hands down towards your ankles , move them down to your lower leg and whatever it is for you , it is just deeper to use the hands around the toes and then you want to feel now because you are holding on to the feet or the ankles. [CLS] [SEP]the shoulders release. [CLS] [SEP]and then you want to feel the heels come in towards you and the knees. [CLS] [SEP]go out away from you .now breath in deep through your nose , exhale and you can release your hands down to your ankles if that is more comfortable like i said and move your hands up to your legs , bring it in. [CLS] [SEP]but it just increases the intensity if you hold on to your toes .keep the shoulders relaxed and breath in deep through your nose and exhale .another deep breath in , each breath feel those heels coming in and feel those knees go out away from you and feeling the shoulders. [CLS] [SEP]relax , breath in deep through your nose and exhale and then release your hands and release the feet down to the floor and shagarone .
to move around the drum kit all you really have to do is just turn your body .your hands can pretty much stay in one spot .and you just kind of move your hips to get around the toms .and to get to the symbols .a good way to practice your technique getting around the drum set is just to hit everything. [CLS] [SEP]just do you know eight strokes on each one and move it around .start off slow you got to get your muscles used to it , it 's called muscle memory so .gradually speed it up .
in the chilling process we 're trying to drop the temperature of the wort as fast as we can to encourage something called cold break which will precipitate proteins and also get the wort to a temperature in which we can mix in our yeast as quickly as we can. [CLS] [SEP]so the yeast has the best chance of establishing itself as the dominant microbe in the wort .while i 'm doing this , i 'm stirring the water around the pot in order to break up the boundary layer that 's forming of hot water .also you can also kind of give the pot a little stir and that gives the boundary layer on the insides .so this will encourage cooler slower or faster cooling .while you 're waiting for your wort to chill , you may want to get a head start on the next step which is yeast preparation .while we 're waiting for it to cool , we 're going to start filling our bucket up with some nice cold water .now with these buckets , this typically represents a half way mark or i. [CLS] [SEP]'m sorry , the five gallon mark .so we 're going to start filling it to roughly 2 and a half gallons .and then we 're going to top off with the wort. [CLS] [SEP]and then what ever else we need to get just to above 5 and a half gallons .so grab your water and start pouring , filling it up .you 're going to want to fill your air lock half up with sanitizing solution or water .this is going to help prevent any microbes or air from getting in and also allow the carbon dioxide to escape .the hot kettle will heat up your water pretty quickly , so once it 's gotten to a pretty warm temperature , you 're going to want to drain it. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to fill it up and add some ice next time .now that we 've filled up the sink again with a nice cold batch of water , we 're going to make it even colder by adding a whole bunch of ice from our refrigerator .then we 're going to continue to swirl the water around it. [CLS] [SEP]so it gets nice and cold and breaks up the hot boundary layer .after a half an hour or so you should be able to take out your pot , hold your hand here , and if it does n't feel hot at all , you 're in good shape .if it still is pretty hot , you 're probably going want to let it sit in some cold water for a little while longer .
repeat , this time faster .then it 's , nay , nay , ne , ni , no , nu .then say , la , lay , lee , lie , lo , lu .you want to say these , each grouping , several times , starting with , ma , may , me , my , mo , mu , then go to , na , nay , ne , ni ,no , nu , then say la , lay , lee , lie , lo , lu .i recommend that , instead of repeating the one phrase , like the 'm ' phrase , may , me , my , moe , mu , but instead of doing it three or four times , which you always can , then you can jump to , na , nay ,ne. [CLS] [SEP]and then la , lay , lee .you can do them that way ; however , i also recommend that you do them back-to-back .so , again , you 'll do a ma , may , me , my , mo , next to a , na , nay , ne , ni , no , nu , next to a , la , lay , lee , lie , lo , lu , so that , you do them that way , as well .you can drill those as many times as you want and that will also help to warm-up your tongue .
okay we are here at tub number 2. [CLS] [SEP]and we are finishing the drainage system with using pvc pipe .you will notice that i 've only drilled holes on one side .the other side of the pipe is intact .we are going to roll the pipe over so that the holes are to the bottom .the reason we are going to do that is because the dirt is going to infiltrate from the top of the pipe down into the inside .if we have the holes in the bottom , water is going to be able to rise in there as it accumulates , get inside the pipe and have an unobstructed path down toward our drain at the other end .we 've plugged the ends just lightly with a can which keeps the dirt and stuff from infiltrating from the top end. [CLS] [SEP]and we 've got an unobstructed path .now for drainage if we drill holes anywhere close to the top , we probably would have dirt going in and getting into the drainage area that we have to have open .you know basically a wide open space for your water to get out and drainage is everything that accumulates around the roots , plants are dead .
so now you got that hole that your needle tool just made in the bottom of your piece. [CLS] [SEP], you want to obviously get that out of there .it is just a little hole. [CLS] [SEP]so just take your finger and flatten out the bottom. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to do that any way .it is called compressing the bottom and by compressing the bottom like that and go over and over and over the bottom of the piece , it actually makes the clay molecules line up in such a pattern that it strengthens them , makes them nice and strong .so you wo n't end up during the firing process you can end up with what is called an s crack .and you know if you end up with an s crack at the end part it is really disappointing because you could have dealt with it when it was green and if you have got an s crack it goes to the landfill. [CLS] [SEP]and it is just a waste of everybody 's time .so just take care of those little things like that and compress , compress , compress .it might seem a little overkill. [CLS] [SEP]but that is how you keep pots from ending up in landfills .so from there we have got our nice flat bottom and i am satisfied where it is. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll get a little bit of water up in there .i want to start making this my desired width with my thumbs. [CLS] [SEP]and i want to pull it out. [CLS] [SEP]but first i want to rub my hands all on this piece here. [CLS] [SEP]and i can feel there is no sticky parts and the hole is nice and louved .so we are ready to start pulling our side walls .so what i am doing i am pulling out with my thumbs and that is about as far as i want to go right there .i just pulled out with my thumbs. [CLS] [SEP]so the piece on the bottom , i 've got my bottom. [CLS] [SEP]and i 've got my chunk of clay and all of this is going to get thrown up into the cylinder .so i 've been establishing my sidewalls and i have been establishing my bottom .before i start to go up. [CLS] [SEP]you want to have all this stuff down here. [CLS] [SEP]sorted out because once you are up it is a pain to go back down .
well , the biggest thing i can recommend , is go out and get yourself a teacher .decide what instrument you want to do , and take lessons , but if you 're really low on your budget , you can definitely go on youtube , and go on the internet , and there are a lot of websites that will teach you how to become a musician .if you 're really self motivated , you can do it yourself , but if you 're like most people , you need a teacher who can really break it down for you , and help you through the process .another great thing you can do , is go to open mike , start performing there , and start meeting other musicians .if you can get friends who are musicians , and you can get together and start practicing together , it 's amazing what you can learn , just from other people .listen to a lot of music , and decide what kind of music you like , really start listening with a different ear .if you 're a drummer , every time you listen to music , listen to what the drummer is doing , exactly .where is the downbeat ?where are the snares ?where is the cymbal ?start fine tuning your ear , and practice , practice , practice .this has been athena reich , in new york city .
if you live in new orleans , look near the levees ; if not , in your house , go to your skate park , just something , just find a ramp .that way , you can practice your tricks on .so once you 've found your ramp , you want to go ahead and warm up .cruise up and down it , roll up , come back down fakie , roll switch , come back down regular , maybe pop a couple of ollies .so once you 're real comfortable with that , you can go ahead .right off switch , you 'll be coming up , just pop a good solid ollie , slide your foot to level it out , slam back down on the bolts , and the key is just to stay centered .so just remember to stay over your board centered and you 'll come back down and roll away clean .and that 's how you switch ollie on a bank ramp .
i 'll be talking about yu gi. [CLS] [SEP]oh. [CLS] [SEP]and this clip is about your line-up for dark world monsters .probably one of the only cards that is not dark world in your entire deck will be morphing jar .limited to one , in most constructed formats , he 's got slightly below average attack and defense , at 700 and 600.his main effect is , when he 's flipped , you discard your hand and draw five cards .this is amazing .the bad thing is it 's amazing for both players , since both players will be refreshing their hands and have new options to play the game .this may just draw them into their win condition .you playing dark world though , have a good chance to stop it , seeing as how your effects are good on his turn when he is forced to make you discard when he hits the morphing jar .used in combination with something called creature swap , you and your opponent will exchange control of one monster , each of you have .you will use face down morphing jar , giving it to your opponent , and he 'll give you one monster that he has .the second part of the combo is that you attack the face down morphing jar .when it 's flipped and you 're forced to discard your hand , the effect counts as your opponent 's effect , which means you get the best bonus , the best effect , the best combination from your dark world monsters .you 'll get reign bueax 's destroy all monsters or backfield .you 'll get golld 's destroy two cards on field , you 'll get brow 's draw two cards. [CLS] [SEP]or you 'll get silva 's , your opponent puts two cards from his hand on the bottom of his deck .
o.k .so we have this placket all hand tacked up , the middle under the arm seam tacked up .i 'm ready to start working on the lining .i want you to make sure first that you get that little extra thread that you have hanging loose. [CLS] [SEP]just leave it on the outside like this .and what i 'm going to do , i 'm going to flip this sleeve out. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm going to turn the sleeve inside outwards. [CLS] [SEP]so let me just grab it from the inside .o.k here we go .o.k. [CLS] [SEP]so there it is , and almost all jackets are tacked together , like they 're tacked together somewhere in there .do n't worry about that just push it in , here we go .o.k .so this is where the bottom of the lining was pressed but if you look on the inside where it was sewn is different. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm not really worried about where it was pressed , i 'm more worried about where it was sewn .because this is exactly , i want to need to hand stitch it exactly three quarters of an inch away from the seam .so instead of using the press as the bottom guide , as the guide , i 'm going to open it up and use the wholes that we 're sewn before as the guide .o.k. [CLS] [SEP]and i remember i was hemming it up three quarters of an inch. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm just going to three quarters of an inch. [CLS] [SEP]and this one is n't very much at all ,so i 'm not even going to worry about cutting it or anything .i 'm just going to turn up that fabric. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to give it a little press before i start tacking it also , and that way it will be nice and pressed and ready to go .there you go , o.k .there you go .and in the next clip i 'm going to show you how to just do a easy little fold up and press and get it ready for that lining .
okay , now we 'll complete our first fringe piece .and you want to bring the beads up close to the edge of the pillow. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to grasp those five pink beads that we 're using for a loop .we 're going to hold onto those. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to return through all the rest of the beads , not the five beads that we 're using for the loop , but all the rest of the beads. [CLS] [SEP]we 're going to return the needle through .and hold on to your looping beads , the three , the five pink beads and you hold onto them and you pull the thread until the loop comes up taught .now you want to be careful not to pull too taught because then you have a very stiff piece of fringe .you want enough slack in your thread so that the fringe will lay down and drape nicely .when you finish that piece of fringe we 're going to do a little bit of a half hitch knot just to secure each piece of fringe .so you grab a little bit of fabric , go into the fabric just a little bit , pull , hold the loop with your thumb , just , or finger and then put your needle back through that loop and pull it down snugly .now to go to the next fringe section you put your needle back in exactly where the fringe starts and follow the needle along the seem line , hiding the thread and coming out at your next marked point .now be careful not , again , not to pull that thread too tightly .you want to leave that piece of fringe nice and loose and draping and now we 'll redo our sequence .following exactly the same as our first one .
in this clip i 'm going to talk to you about how to maintain the results of your body wrap at home .one of my favorite things in the entire world is this cactus bristle body brush .and we use it very gently , upward motions , always toward the heart .because we want to follow the lymphatic system .and at home , you just want to go very gently .as you can see , i 'm not bending the bristles , i 'm not applying a lot of pressure .this is the best thing to prevent cellulite , also to get your body moving , to energize yourself in the morning .definitely use it before your shower .wonderful .excellent if followed by aromatherapy oil at home .in the treatment , we apply aromatherapy oils to the products that we use to wrap you .and there 's no reason why you ca n't give yourself and aromatherapy treatment at home .whether it 's inhaling or the actual application to your skin , you 're going to get the benefits .and also , from the smoothness standpoint , you really want a great body hydrator , one that contains shea butter or coco butter , but also , something with olive products is excellent for anti-aging and soothing sensitive skin .so , you want to make sure it 's a nice , rich cream .i love that one .
let 's drill our three quarter down shimmy .let 's first start by bringing it down in the front on one leg , then press it out shifting it outside and still on that same leg .up on the other side , down , out , up .down , out , up .a little faster , down , out , up , down , out , up , down , out , up , down , out , up .good .try and get all the action in the hips here and keep the head as still as you can .good .now we 're going to speed it up just a little more .good .let 's slow it down again .it 's always a good idea to go slow , medium and fast so that you can build up your endurance and precision .it 's not about going fast , it 's about doing it accurately .when you do it accurately you can always speed it up. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 'll still look nice and clean .so practice this in the mirror .
hi i 'm sundae from natural sundae and if you are wondering what tui na massage is i can tell you .now tui na massage is actually a chinese form of touch therapy that has been around for over 2 ,000 years and. [CLS] [SEP]the basis of tui na massage is that there are energy channels or meridians in your body and if you have the energy flowing them that is unblocked and balanced at the same time you will have you can be able to maintain health and also prevent disease .there are three techniques that are commonly used in tui na massage .the first technique of course is massage which is the manipulation of soft tissue which means muscles , tendons and connective tissue .the second type of therapy is acupressure which is putting specific pressure on energy points in the body to allow energy to flow very freely and to be balance and the third type of technique used is manipulation of the musculoskeletal system which means manipulating the skeleton and the muscles to work correctly and in proportion to one another .now in the typical tui na massage it is not done on a massage table .it is done on a mat on the floor with the client fully clothed so no oils or creams are used and the client usually wants to wear loose clothing so that the therapist can really not have to worry about obstructions caused by tight clothing and so actually the client is also as comfortable as possible .now what happens in a typical tui na session is the practitioner will focus on specific pain sites and try to manipulate that soft tissue to help release the pain that will also focus on acupressure points and the energy meridians to help that energy be able to flow seamlessly , effortlessly and without blockages .they want to balance that energy. [CLS] [SEP]so it can run very smoothly through the body and maintain health .the third technique is manipulation of that soft tissue. [CLS] [SEP]and so they can use joint mobilization , muscle compression and all these things. [CLS] [SEP]work together as a whole to create health in the mind , body and spirit. [CLS] [SEP]so tui na is a traditional form of chinese touch therapy that has been around for 2 ,000 years and it is holistic meaning it touches the physical body , the mental body and the emotional body .i 'm sundae with natural sundae .
i lay the entire kite out , put my bridles inside and , then from the wingtips , we fold in towards the center from both sides .make sure all my struts are on clips. [CLS] [SEP]so i can get all the air out of the kite .sometimes when you 're putting it away , just in order to get out for a quicker session the next time , you can leave air in the struts and actually just roll the entire kite on to it ,that way it 's a little less pumping. [CLS] [SEP]you got to do when you 're coming out next time .so without dragging my kite on this pavement too much , we 're going to fold it over right here on the wingtip .any way you want to fold this , you know , most of this sport is personal preference , right here , this is the way that i can get the kite most compact and right down so that it 's like the perfect size , it 'll fit in its bag .especially when traveling , do n't roll your kite , make small folds .in sailing , they 're actually called flaking your sail .we do n't necessarily flake this , but we 're going to fold it that way and really press down all the air and make sure that these are nice flat little folds .so .as i do this , i 'm going to do my best to really try and get all the sand out of there .and i want to fold it in a fashion that just follows up the leading edge and the trailing edge , making sure not to let it sort of taper off to either side .so now that i 've got this wingtip all the way folded into the center , i 'm going to come over to this one .you see my bridle got wrapped in the process .i 'm going to take it , throw it inside , and do the same thing for this side .nice and sandy .i 'm really trying to press out all the air from all these little struts and bladders .that way , when i go to store my kite , i know that it 's down as compact as it can possibly get .ooh , almost a little bit in the eyes .so the great thing about kiting versus other sports like , you know , probably it 's biggest equivalent is windsurfing people say , is all you need to do to get out for a session. [CLS] [SEP]is have your kite , your harness , your board , a bar and some wind .at the end of the day , when all is said and done , you did a downwinder or anything , you can just fold the kite up , simple one , two , three , and boom .this is a nine meter kite and look how tiny it is .i can wrap my harness around it and , actually , i got a little briefcase that i can go walk away with .if your big downwind is all the day this beach here , at st. [CLS] [SEP]pete beach , and there 's a trolley you can use , but you got to wear booties and a shirt , so we just make sure we bring our thumbs and take it all the way down the beach .
i 've also painted the bottom .you want to orient your box .this is where the front latch goes and this is where the back hinges go .you want to make sure that you put your pictures on in the right direction .let 's start with the top picture .we 're going to cut it out. [CLS] [SEP]so it fits fairly exactly on there .we 're not going to be trimming after .right here it 's a little too close here. [CLS] [SEP]so we 're going to move it down there .you have to play with your picture and put it on where it looks the best .i 'm going to put a little bit of a crease there .this seems to follow that crease .cut out your piece .you want to cut as straight as possible .you could use a paper cutter if you have difficulty cutting straight .you could use a ruler with a razor blade on a cutting surface for cutting nice and straight lines .it 's not so fussy because we 're going to be putting the top. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 'll put a border on .
once i have rinsed completely , the shampoo out of her hair , my next step will be to condition it .again , i will be using curl enhancing products , and this one , is a curls conditioner .this shampoo and conditioner , are specifically designed for curly hair again , and it will help you form a uniform curl , all over her head .you can decide on how much conditioner you 'll need , according to how much your hair needs it .i 'm going to start crunching through the hair , so that the curl begins to form on its own .make sure that you distribute the conditioner through , all over her hair .it 's important that you do that , because the curl needs to be uniform .i 'm going to rinse now , take my towel , and towel it off .what i 'm doing with her curl , is i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]crunching it , as i bring the towel to her hair .again , my main focus is to keep her curl uniform .i 'm going to bring my client up , bring the chair back up , and bring her onto a neutral position .
another common movement , which is used in one of the drum rhythms called bottom bai , is another right to left movement , and it involves picking up one of your legs and putting it behind you as you move right to left .so what you want to do is , we 'll start with the feet , and you just want to step right. [CLS] [SEP], you lift your leg , left leg up .so step left , you lift you other leg up , and as you lift and step , you want to kind of turn your body that way .so if i 'm stepping left , i 'm going to be facing right at the end of that step .just side to side , a little bit of twisting , and then once we add the arms , it 's going to be kind of an opening and closing motion .open , close , and you 're twisting your body , and going side to side , and there are different arm variations for this .if you want to raise your arm up and do a kind of scooping motion , that 's also pretty common .the main thing to keep in mind , is just to keep turning your body left and right .it looks a little bit more dramatic that way , and it fits very well with the bottom bai rhythm , which we 'll be going over in one of our later series .
the first thing we 're going cover about beat boxing is how you hold the microphone .it 's very important the way you hold the microphone because if you are holding it wrong you 're not going to be able to get the right sound out of the microphone .so first off , make sure you 're holding the base of the microphone , and have your right hand over the top of the microphone .this right hand 's really important because if you do n't have it over you 're going to be losing a lot of the sound that you 're generating out of your mouth .so if you beat box without the hand it 'll sound like this .but if you have your hand over it it 'll sound like this .so that 's basically the raw basics that you need in holding the microphone .make sure you 're hand 's over there. [CLS] [SEP]and once it 's over you can do whatever you want .
mostly the blue is on that side and this is like a dark , not a navy ,well i guess you could say navy blue .i am going to use this blue here. [CLS] [SEP]and i am going to get one of my bigger brushes. [CLS] [SEP]and i am going to wipe the water off on my jeans because it is going to be too much water .i am going to take the blue and mix this in. [CLS] [SEP]and i am going to go on this side first and with the style that i have been using. [CLS] [SEP]so far i can just kind of fill this in and it can be very loose because everything else has been very loose and suggestive .actually you can do some pretty cool things with the background and give it a lot of texture. [CLS] [SEP]and if you just kind of bounce the brush around it will give you an interesting background anyway .this is kind of a 20 's feel with velvet walls and things like that. [CLS] [SEP]and then for the other side you can go even darker and mix in the blues sporadically and. [CLS] [SEP]all of a sudden the painting is really starting to come to life. [CLS] [SEP]and she is starting to come out of there as well and see when you get to this side the hair will almost disappear into the background. [CLS] [SEP]so you do n't really know where the background begins and vice versa .okay. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's my neighbor honking his horn which is like a celebration beep because the painting is almost complete .just be careful around the edges of your figure. [CLS] [SEP]you do n't want to get on the wrong side of that because then it will look like you just kind of painted over it. [CLS] [SEP]and it is almost. [CLS] [SEP]like you want to trace it .now this side you can get a little nutty with .you do n't want the background to eat up the hat either .when you get into these really tight areas just give it a slow roll and you have to kind of feel the curves of the body with the brush and then kind of blend it back in. [CLS] [SEP]and there is your finished 1920 's photo .
i 've done a little bit of dash. [CLS] [SEP]disassembly work. [CLS] [SEP], you can see i have the shifter panel out of the way and. [CLS] [SEP]part of the dashboard removed .my fog light switch is located right here. [CLS] [SEP]and i have the connector here in my hand .i 'm going to check the circuit for continuity in all of the pins that we have .continuity here , continuity here , continuity here and continuity here .that means all the wires have every bit of the integrity that they should have .i 'm also going to jumper this pin here .on your particular vehicle , it will have a fog light relay .when you jump positive power to the relay positive feed , you 'll hear the relaying gage , it will be a click click noise .if you listen very closely you will hear it .if you connect to the relay positive input with positive power and you do n't hear a clicking noise , that 's going to indicate a failed relay .if you have all of your continuity here and your switch is working , that indicates your problem is farther forward indicating that your lights are actually bad .the bulb is burnt out or the lamps themselves have been rusted and degraded .
now , unlike a saxophone , the bass clarinet in the middle between your legs .the reason being , that you do not want to interfere with function of these lower keys here by touching it with your thigh , for instance .sitting or standing , you want to have it between your legs .you want the mouth to piece to meet you at your lower lip , not at your chin or up above. [CLS] [SEP]so you can adjust your chain or your neck strap to the proper level ; it ’ s very important to do that .if you ’ re going to stand , the position of the clarinet stays relatively the same .that was a little bit about posture and holding the bass clarinet .
in this clip we 'll talk briefly about why it 's good to avoid drugs , caffeine and alcohol .one of the things you got to remember is that when you have a phobia , your body 's already moving faster , your minds thinking faster , or slower , ( depending on the situation ) than you want it to .by taking , drinking things like tea or coffee or sodas , you 're actually going to be adding caffeine to your body .caffeine is going to speed up things , and can actually lead to increased anxiety .so you really do n't want to add to all the anxiety you 're feeling by fueling the fire .same thing goes with drugs and alcohol .if you 're experiencing any kind of depression , it can actually add to it .the drugs and the alcohol also may seem like a really good idea , like if i take a beer , drink a beer right now , or take this pill , it 's going to relax me , and in the long run it actually could end up provoking more anxiety , and making things a lot worse .sometimes a doctor will prescribe anxiety medication or antidepressants , and you need to follow that prescription however it is .if you feel that after you 're taking whatever medication , and it 's not working , talk to your doctor , but you never want to self medicate .
so , in order to make your lid fit your bowl. [CLS] [SEP]just perfectly it 's important to use a tool called a caliper .and you 're going to need two pair in order to do any kind of lid fitting properly .the first thing you want to do , these calipers can be opened this way or they can crisscross each other to go this way .and when you take the interior measurement of something you want to have them crisscrossed like this .now you want to hold your calipers directly over the center line of your piece so that you 're getting the maximum diameter measurement .and you 're just going to adjust your calipers and hold them over the piece until the corners of the calipers touch just at the very top of your lid gallery .you want that widest measurement .and once you 've got a measurement that you 're happy with you take this first pair of calipers and you line the second pair of calipers up touching the edges of the first pair of calipers so that your measurement is this way because you 're going to measure the outside of your lid rather than the inside .and now we 're read to throw the lid .
i 'm here to answer the question. [CLS] [SEP], how do i defer jury duty ?well , the question really is , how do you defer jury duty , as opposed to , how do you get out of jury duty , because basically you do n't get out of jury duty .so you 're really looking to see how can you can defer it .and one of the first things you want to do is , you want to attend to it as soon as possible. [CLS] [SEP], do n't put it on the kitchen counter and forget about it .go immediately and call the number that is listed on the summons and find out what time you 're supposed to report for , and then determine whether you have a conflict .good reasons for conflicts are , you 're having a baby , you 're getting married , there 's a financial hardship at the time , you have your own business , you 're the only one operating the business , if you 're not there the business does n't operate , thus you do n't get paid , thus creating the financial hardship , and so forth and so on .it 's not a question of whether you 're going to serve , because you are , it 's a question when is it more convenient for you to serve .and that 's how you defer jury duty .i 'm robert todd , and thank you for watching .
so , we 've went through some maintenance , some basic maintenance for your paintball gun , and we 've shown you how to check that weapon after the fact and make sure that it 's functioning properly .but , let 's say you 're at home. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're working on it. [CLS] [SEP]and you 've done your test , and maybe you even have a little range where you go and shoot , always being safe and using goggles , but now you want to put the weapon away .you need to put the weapon away properly .it is a gun , it is not a firearm. [CLS] [SEP]but , it is a gun and because it is a gun , it can hurt somebody .you could end up being liable and legally responsible for that , should someone find out that your gun , and your lack of care and proper storage resulted in an injury .so , it is something to pay attention to .first thing you want to do before you try to store the weapon. [CLS] [SEP]is you want to take away again , just like you do in maintenance , you want to take away the propellant , you want the air to come off and obviously we do n't have a hopper on , so we do n't have any paint in the weapon , and since we just checked it and put it back together , or put it back together after doing some maintenance on it and checked it .we know there 's no paint in the weapon , but the bolt is back , now we do n't want to store it that way because that , that can over time take away the efficiency of the springs .so , what you want to do is pull the trigger and let the bolt go forward gently and now the bolt is forward , the safety is on. [CLS] [SEP], there 's no paint , there 's no air. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's double safe .so , this weapon can now be stored and it should be put in a safe place , away from children .it should n't be stored with the necessary parts to , to be able to arm the , arm the gun and put paint in it , unless you 're right there .so , it 's usually a good idea to store your paint and your air away from your gun .probably get yourself a good gun case and put this up somewhere , where you know that you 're the only person that can get to it .once you 've done that , then you 've met the legal requirements .the other thing to remember is keep it in a dry place , you do n't want the weapon to sit up. [CLS] [SEP]wet .and , another thing i always do is i take the gun oil. [CLS] [SEP]and i actually oil all the screws on the weapon , and all the push pins , just a little bit , just to make sure that the next time i come back to take it apart , they 're well lubricated .if you come across a gun and you have to open it up and it has rusty screws , it 's always a good idea to put a little oil on it first and let that soak down into the threads .and , it makes it a lot easier to break the screw loose , without damaging the head .
it 's very soft and it 's a combination of synthetic and natural hair .this is a great brush for powder because it keeps everything loose without giving it a cakey feel .like i said ,i 'm using a loose powder today , so i want to start by taking some of the powder and pouring it into the cap .that 's good .i 'm going to lightly tap the brush into the powder .tap off some of the excess and just lightly go over the entire face .under the eye where we just concealed , working my way down and out .again , tap , work up toward the hair line .you always want to work your way toward the hair line .this is a translucent powder. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's going to give a really light finish. [CLS] [SEP]and you do n't necessarily have to be perfect with it .i know this is a unique brush .everyone might have something closer to this at their house .you would use it the same way .just swirl it in the powder .you might have to tap it off a little bit because you can see how it gets deposits of more powder whereas this one gets an equal share of powder through the whole brush .
let 's talk about the purpose of the chorus in a country song .now , where country is different from folk music , they are two very similar genres .what 's different from folk music and country music is that in folk music , the main point of the chorus and of the writing in general is for the sake of protest and stating a moral or something like that whereas with country music , there is elements of that and that 's a way you can go .however , with country music , that 's not nearly as important .the point of country music , especially the chorus for the country music is to tie the story together in a clever way , in singable way , that 's just very -- that 's simple and easy to remember .the hook in country music is one of the most prominent and singable hooks you 'll ever sing in any genre of music and it is something that you need to take time and really work hard on , try to come up with a clever and witty line that might be some -- a cliche. [CLS] [SEP], that might be said just slightly different or something like that and do it in such a way where it really ties the verses together , where it really brings it home , whether it 's a funny song. [CLS] [SEP], that 's where the punch line goes or whether it 's just a story of longing or of love or something like that .that is where the main point comes .the chorus is like stating your thesis and in country music , really what it is is stating the main point of the story and narrative of the rest of the song .
so now to balance off what we just did previously. [CLS] [SEP]i am going to push the foot backwards towards sara 's head but be prepared that you are not just thrusting the foot back in a haphazard way .you are grabbing the heel and the bottom part of her foot and pushing back , very simple .it is just a way of establishing a memory in the way of the body in the way things should be moving .that is a lot of what shiatsu is is just re-establishing the way we should naturally be , kind of the way a child is naturally balanced .if you look at a child 's body they are always working from the hara .they have a very full and relaxed tummy .they work in a coordinated way .it is just a matter of reprogramming our body to get back into that memory that our body has and really wants to get back to , to move freely without stress , without tension and with that emotional freedom to always cry and laugh if we can .we are going to finish up this section by shaking out the legs .i am going to stand up and grab sara 's ankles here and simply shake them out , shake them out , keep those hips loose , rocking , rocking , rocking .i 'm creating a movement here and a flow .be a little vigorous if you can , yea , it 's nice that somebody else can do the walking for you huh ?okay. [CLS] [SEP]and let it go .we 'll get to our next section when we return .
good. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to show you how you can make your partner really feel great with this strap .so you 're going to take this strap right around her sacrum area. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 're going to bring it through the legs .good .so it wraps around the back and through the legs .i 'm going to ask gina to inhale. [CLS] [SEP]and then as she exhales , i 'm just going to gently draw her back so that her spine is lengthening .does n't that feel great ?yes .good .and then allowing her to release .that 's a really good way to come down deeper into your down dog and really get a great feeling on your spine .just finishing off with a little back rub .
i 'm bill elzey with showplace lawns .let 's talk a little bit about how to get rid of grub worms .the big ugly .what they call white grubs .that are in like a c shape in your lawn .they are actually the larva stage of the june bugs that we have later on in the year .grub worms eat the roots off the grass .therefore of course killing the grass .you should be able to take the grass and just roll it up if you have grub damage , because they cut the roots completely off .the best way to prevent this from happening is number one .be sure that you have a very fertile soil .work to have fertile ground and fertile plants .that will discourage them very much right there .the second thing is use beneficial nematodes .one of the things that nematodes does well is to take care of the grubs .to eliminate them from causing your lawn a problem .nematodes are sprayed out .they are good for lots of insects .this should be done about three times a year or depending on where you are , how long your growing season is might determine maybe just twice or so forth .but beneficial nematodes are an ideal way of getting out in front and keeping those grub worms away and works together really well with a fertile soil .with the nematodes out be sure , and this would be in keeping with a fertile soil .to do a regular watering .to help keep the nematodes alive and active .again , beneficial nematodes and fertile soil .two great , healthy , non-abrasive ways of controlling grub worms .
so we 're talking about hands that are good to stand pat on in the game of poker dice .and let 's talk about that .i would say that the bare minimum , if you want to keep it to one roll , is a pair of aces .you roll a pair of aces and you 're rolling first , you can stand pat and say , `` ha !beat that ! ''that puts the minimal amount of pressure , the minimal amount of pressure on your opponent to give you the possibility of winning .now , better , would be two pair .say aces up , aces and tens .or kings and tens , kings up .kings and jacks , of course , that 's also kings up , and so forth .any two pair ofter one or two rolls. [CLS] [SEP], you 're in good shape .also , three pair , great !if you get three pair , stand pat .if you have , i said three pair , i meant three of a kind. [CLS] [SEP]but you noticed that .if you have a pair of kings after one or two rolls , roll on and try to make it three of a kind .any hand , of course , above that is a good hand to stand pat .
life link is when any card , especially any particular creature cards , enchantments , and sorceries are linked directly to your life .now here we have venerable monk .he comes into play .he 's a 2/2 and when venerable monk comes into play you gain 2 life .that is an example of life link .another example of life link , is here we have , highway robber .who is also a 2/2 , but when he comes into play , not only do you gain 2 life , you can have a target opponent lose 2 life .more examples of this are cards that say , when starting creature , an example : venerable monk ,deals damage to a player. [CLS] [SEP], then you gain that much life .another example is when a certain enchantment goes into a graveyard and. [CLS] [SEP]you have target opponent lose life .all these are examples of non-direct damage .these are static ability damages , but life link itself is a multiplex static ability .which means that there are many different versions of life link .so , you have to be really careful with your cards and the cards you play .
as you are reading a piece of music you want to be aware of dynamic markings which simply means how loud or soft the music should be .frequently dynamic markings will look like this…here we see a mezzo forte and here is an example of a mezzo piano. [CLS] [SEP]basically if there ’ s an f it means loud , forte for example is loud if there were two f ’ s. [CLS] [SEP]it would be even louder fortissimo , if there were three or four f ’ s. [CLS] [SEP]it would be even louder than that , that ’ s about as loud as you can get .mezzo forte is a step down from a forte so not quiet as loud , the next step down from mezzo forte would be mezzo piano which is soft but not too soft , a step down from mezzo piano is piano which is soft and here we see an example of a pianissimo which is two p ’. [CLS] [SEP]s , if a composer wanted you to play even softer than this there would be a string of p ’ s , as soft as you can play .also dynamic markings include crescendos and decrescendos , crescendos show the volume getting louder. [CLS] [SEP]and it ’ s represented by the very small part of the fork which would be soft and as the lines grow further apart and this end gets fatter you ’ re getting louder , this is a crescendo , here we have the opposite it starts loud and then dies away. [CLS] [SEP]it gets softer and that ’ s all you need to know about dynamics .
so the last part of any ensemble when you are putting it together and you are wanting to go retro. [CLS] [SEP]is to get the right accessories .now we have talked about jewelry , we have talked about ethnic jewelry .we talked about head bands which still remained popular but were worn by the disco stylists of the time. [CLS] [SEP]and i want to show you a couple of bags that might have been used in the 70s .so this bag is shiny the way we saw a lot of other disco stuff was .it is also leather which was used a lot and it also has really nice hardware on it that is shiny. [CLS] [SEP]and we talked about the bling of the 70s which was really the disco times .it is even in a hobo shape which actually emerged in the 70 's and is still popular today .then i want to show you a bag that would go more with the ethnic trend that we talked about .this bag is from peru it was made in peru and this is the kind of thing that a hippie might carry or that might be worn with a dress like this to have a really ethnic ensemble .one thing is it was handmade and made in the area. [CLS] [SEP]and that was important to people .the last thing i want to show you is a knit shirt .we did not talk a lot about knits but knits sort of spanned all the trends that we have talked about and this is a shirt right here and by knits. [CLS] [SEP]i mean that it is sweater material and also that there is a crochet on it and this sort of detailing would be helpful in a shirt or an accessory or any sort of piece to really make your look look 1970 's .
alright , i am going to tell you now how to prepare a reed to play .it is important to get the reed wet , to get a good vibration when you are blowing into the saxophone .thinking again about a reed in a pond .the pores in this thing carry water from the bottom to the top of the reed .if you look at it from the back you can almost see the pores .the best way for me to start preparing my reed is to put the back end in my mouth .it is going to pull the spit from my mouth through the reed actually for me , it is just like magic , the whole thing could be wet pretty soon. [CLS] [SEP]so i put it in my mouth , get it nice and wet , and probably spend a little more time on it in real life , turn it around and get the front end wet , like so .without getting your reed wet , it actually does not vibrate as well and it causes a lot of squeaking and stuff .you should spend about two or three minutes preparing your reed for the first time when you are using it for the day .wooden reeds are the ones that you will need to get wet .synthetic reeds do not need to be wet. [CLS] [SEP]but you lose this natural feel in the reed in my opinion .make sure that you spend some time preparing your reed before you play .
costa waez :now , i 'm going to talk to you about safety .when you use the hookah , you need to use all the safety , necessary things .now , you see the hookah on the table ?this is wrong .we just put it because we 're shooting this video .what you do , you put it down on the floor , at the bottom of the floor , you have to hold it from the bottom , not from the top because the bottom might slip down and it break .so you move it down on the floor and you place it carefully .the reason that we do n't have it on the table. [CLS] [SEP]it 's because some might knock it down and burn someone 's face or someone 's clothes or any person will be around .and because they 're so tall and they might -- the table might shake and this might fall down .definitely , they going to be on the floor , placed there and smoke and enjoy .and also , for the outdoor , we can use this one here , also , this is safety for outdoor .you put it here , just in case if there is a wind , the wind will not blow the charcoal and burn someone , or fall on the floor .
d minor is extracted from the f major scale , so everything is natural , but b. [CLS] [SEP]kind of trashy with d major .
so , next , we 're going to be aging the clothing .and for this , i 'm going to want to have a couple different shades of gray .get gray by first taking white and then adding in some mars black and using our palette knife here , mix it up .actually in this case , i do n't even want to make it fuller monochrome , you can have different shades of gray because , as you 're going to see here , we 're going to use a bunch of different types of grays .warmer and cooler varieties of gray .this under painting of blue here is very vibrant and strong .it looks like , you know , just bought this outfit down at the store .so , we 're going to age it .because we 're going to go with kind of more of a zombieish , ghoulish look for our female subject here .so again , to illustrate the examples of what you can do just by building up the layers .you can see automatically , it 's already starting to look more dingy .i 'm not even always like taking my brush and dragging it over the colors .more of kind of like a spotty .and when you do that , you get like these wonderful areas of like a regularly shaped emphasis to where the paint 's a little thicker than it is elsewhere .now , i 'm extending this brush work down this way .again , just kind of dragging , taking some of the muted tone out .it 's really ; you can also see that where i 'm allowing the blue to still show through. [CLS] [SEP]and this is one of the magic ?s of under painting .because now this looks much more , much more of substance than it did before .here 's something else you can do , you can always take some paint .this is a little lighter for effect , i 'll blend this more with the blue and basically , what i 'm doing here is i 'm adding in lose threads .this is not a nice , sewn , new shirt .this is more ragged .raggedy .there are lots of lose threads going up over in here .you can also take this , see how this border is nice and strong , you can also take this to dig our big gashes where there are just chunks missing where the material has fallen away .you can take these in as deep as you want just make sure to keep giving the impression of , you know , lose threads in fabric .this is n't going to be like something take a bit out of this .it 's going to be like frayed edges .now , we 're going to extend these aging effects we 've covered onto the rest of the clothing .
the tuning pegs , each of them correspond to each of strings on the violin , and as you 'll see , if you look closely , this lower left hand peg ,this tunes the g string .the upper left hand peg , tunes the d string .the upper right hand peg , tunes the a string , and the lower right hand peg ,tunes the e string .in the very beginning , you will most likely have four fine tuners at the bottom of your violin , .as you 'll see on my violin , i only have one fine tuner on the e string .and , that 's because after you really become comfortable with tuning , then usually what you can do is you can take off all of the pegs , although it 's a good idea to keep your e string peg because it is a thin string .it 's not good to tune as much from here because you run the risk of actually breaking the string .by keeping this fine tuner here , it 'll help you tune the e string a lot easier because it 's a thin string. [CLS] [SEP], it 's a little bit different to tune , but for the others in the beginning you 'll be using the fine tuners , and at end , when you 're using the pegs , you 're really going to be using the pegs for the a , d , and g strings .
okay , one of the things an athlete has to remember is that he or she has to be prepared .the day before your race or the night before your competition , make sure you drink a lot of fluids .make sure you have a lot of fluids into your body .make sure that you 're resting .make sure that you 're properly stretching the body out before and after your competition or your event .this helps a lot in terms keeping the body efficient , keeping the body healthy .the more rest you can get is important , the more fluids you put into your body .it helps you to maintain longer on the track .it helps you in your workouts .it helps you in your daily life .
you only have it on one side .it ’ s not really for utilitarian purposes .it will hold one side of the collar down , but. [CLS] [SEP]i mean honestly , what 's the point of holding one side down , if you do n't hold the other side down ?the whole point is , that it creates a different look .this one nap part is attaching this part of the collar , there .now , this collar is all one piece .of course , like i said a zillion times , it 's notched , in my rendition of it , and it starts out as a regular old collar .making it with the lapel being curved , is just a design choice , that 's like a shawl collar .you could do it straight .you could have the notch be bigger .you could have it do anything , but the part that makes it one nap , is right here with those little loopty doop closures , that are attaching it to the actual jacket .
this hairstyle is a little bit more done .it 's not so sloppy .you can see we have it piled up on her head .there 's her bangs. [CLS] [SEP]and then i have a headband , right there , or a scarf or a bandana , whatever variation you want to choose .the best way i can tell you to do something like this , is to start with , if you 're going to put something in the hair , like a hat , a headband , you 're going to put sunglasses on the head , start with that and then work your way around it .always start with them central focus of the area that you 're designing on .if you started drawing the hair , then you try to put the headband in , it might end up looking a little off , so you want to be sure you place that where the headband would go , so it does n't look weird .draw your headband and then draw your hair that 's piled on top. [CLS] [SEP]and then your bangs. [CLS] [SEP]and there you have it .
this opening style is called a cowl halter .what that means is that it 's like a cowl neck shirt , except it has a halter top .a halter top means that no matter what you have , here is your design style .in order for it to be labeled with this word , halter , it needs to cut in ever so lightly , slightly , or a whole wide , it does n't matter , needs to cut in from the armpit up to some point on the shoulder line , and then it has to go around the neck .that 's the whole point of a halter. [CLS] [SEP]is that it goes all the way around the neck .and this could have a , it could have buttons , maybe , making it closed , it could have tabs , it could be tied , but it has to go around the full length of the neck in order to be called a halter .the cowl part of it comes from the neckline being draped in such a way as represented here by our little dashes and shading .this just shows that it 's draped and it 's hanging around the neckline .
a nice way to lengthen through the spine is a nice flat back flow. [CLS] [SEP]so we 're going to be using the chair again for this pose .so come on up .you are going to be using the back of this chair. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm going to turn this chair backwards and have you place your hands on the back of this chair , get a nice firm grip because you are going to be using this for a little bit of support ,o'kay ?now what i 'm going to have you do is very slowly , the first one , just walk your feet back and start lowering down until you feel a nice flat back , turn your toes slightly inwards , yes .keep that alignment going .now notice that how she literally from arms , through her neck , down the length of her spine , she has got a nice beautiful alignment and legs are dropped straight down underneath .now let 's turn it into a little bit of a flow , very slowly start walking forward lifting up as you come and as you come keep the neck in alignment and slowly walk straight back into it .keep that neck in alignment the whole time , beautiful , keep that alignment going , perfect , walk back up , we 're going to do it one more time .feel some space coming into that spine as you do this .walking back gently , beautiful , reach out through the crown of your head , beautiful , last time walk forward .
alright , we 've waited about five minutes now , to let our rice cook , and if you would like to speed that process up , you can put it in the refrigerator and let that cool .so , what we 're going to do now is we 're going to scoop out a half a cup of our rice , and we 're going to put that in our bowl .then , we 're going to go , and measure out a half cup of cottage cheese , and we 'll add that as well .then , we 're going to go and take two eggs , and then we 're going to gently stir and swirl , until the egg and cottage cheese , is completely incorporated in the rice .
lem. [CLS] [SEP]me show you ; let me show you a few more examples .we have here , an ace of hearts and let ’. [CLS] [SEP]s grab our queen of clubs .this too , is a blackjack .ahh , let ’ s grab our ace of diamonds here , with the uh , king of diamonds , same suit , but still a blackjack or twenty-one .in the last example , just to show you is the ace of clubs , and lets grab a ten , worth exactly what you see as i said , ten .and together , this makes a blackjack or twenty-one also .
there are many tools that a producer has at his disposal .some are a keyboard , a sequencer , a sampler .now let me just break that down a little bit , for you .the main tools are a sequencer .every production , every you know , song has some sort of rhythm to it .now unless , you have a live drummer playing the track , you need to program that , into some sort of beat machine .so that 's the sequencer .that 's the kick , the snare , the hi hat .then you have the key board .which basically , you play the melodies , you can mix strings , all these different things .you can use samples .a lot of producers do use samples .and in that you 're going to use a sampler .and you 'd fit it , match it with the sequencer .put the sample over it and then loop it .that 's one way to do it .now another way is to bring in musicians .get a beat going , get the drum .the drum track .and then , have live musicians play over it .that 's going to give you the best sound .some other tools , that you would definitely need as a music producer , is a computer .personally , i recommend a macintosh , an apple computer .i use pro tools which is a great software .you can also use resin which is actually , where you would make the beat .some people make the beat in pro tools .but it 's a little bit different method .i wo n't go into that , right now .but basically , you know , you have your software .you have your hardware .and together , you make it all work .some other tools that you would need as a music producer .aside from actually making the music , is a microphone , a preamp which amplifies the sound .a compressor and some other out board gear .that you know , you could find at a guitar center or any where else , that you 're looking to buy equipment .now this equipment is very important .because it boosts the sound .it makes it sound a little bit more professional .
okay , we are going to learn how to make a wallet today in misty swift style because i like to do stuff a little differently .i do not like patterns , so pretty much everything i do , will be winging it , so. [CLS] [SEP]if that 's how you like to do stuff , this will work out great for you !first we need to pick out the material. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to make sure that it 's not too stretchy .i got some samples here .this is beautiful brown velvet , but it 's way too stretchy ; if you try to use that it 's going to get really out of control , you 're going to have a hard time handling it. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to have problems .satin is beautiful , but it 's not good for handling , so if you 're making a wallet , you want something that can be handled that 's not going to pick up the oils from your hands .obviously something like this is going to be too whimsical ; this is also too stretchy .you can find materials like this , kind of a faux suede , it 's really soft , really pretty , this would work fine , but i would avoid finding anything that is already pieced together for something as small as a wallet because the seams can mess you up and set you off and it can make it look really crooked if you do n't have it just right .i would recommend a cotton. [CLS] [SEP], linens are good ; this is all different kinds of cottons .you have a huge variety .wallets are fun because you can use novelty patterns and you want to make sure you get something that 's washable because wallets do tend to , end up getting spotted .you 'll need about a half a yard. [CLS] [SEP]and you can have two different patterns because that 's all you 'll need for a wallet is the front and the back. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's pretty much all on the material .
we can use an inhale to soften your knees , lift your hands .the exhale can hop you wide , or you have the freedom to step wide .then we 'll go travel down to the soles of our feet .turning your left foot out , presenting that foot still in tadasana , so not leaning in or out , front or back , but it 's balanced equally .looking to your right foot , it 's going to be gently turned in , and still presented in tadasana .working from the base , coming up the legs , we want to contract the legs ; creating strength .coming into your hips , the hips , shoulders are squarely forward .we 're going to use a new inhale to lift both arms .the exhale 's going to strongly reach you to the left .kick your hip out to the right , keep reaching , keep reaching , keep reaching ; you 're creating length in both sides .you 're going to find a place to hold on , either to your thigh , to your shin , or to your ankle .lengthen through the crown of your head , and then we 're going to try to maintain the pose for up to two minutes , breathing and enjoying .
this drink is called drum cocktail .lot of ingredients in this drink , so grab a pen and paper and follow along with me .you can make this as a blender drink as well .we 're going to make it on the rocks .go ahead and start off with your rocks in your glass like so .we 're going to do an ounce of rum , light rum , an ounce of apricot flavored brandy , half an ounce of dark rum , half an ounce of gold tequila , and a half an ounce of triple sec .now we 're going to do some freshly squeezed orange juice , about three ounces or so , like so , and a dash of grenadine .last but not least , a dash of bitters .two dashes , two dashes of bitters .mix it all together .this is what your drum cocktail is going to look like .lots of ingredients , very tasty .go ahead and garnish with a cocktail straw , and you are good to go .cheers !
we 're going to go through some defense against knife attacks .so first we 're going to start out with a jab .someone 's jabbing at you , you perry , like a gaan sau move , grab your hand over , twist the wrist , make sure you lock the wrist up , twist it back , bring the knee up to the elbow , and then come into the back of the leg in a kick .all right , again , slow speed , perry , grabs the wrist , twist it , and kick .all right .normal speed .again .all right .now i 'm going to go through the attack , known as a `` psycho '' style .someone comes down .all right .so they 're coming down. [CLS] [SEP], you 're using your bong sau and your wu sau together , moving out of the way , grabbing , pulling the arm .again , going for the elbow and the knee , you 're behind the leg , you want to try and get rid of the knife as soon as possible .right .the knee to the elbow always works right away .next we have the type of attack where the person is slinging. [CLS] [SEP]and you bring the arm into wu sau , and you can trap the arm the same way and come into attack .you wu sau , lock the arm , and then break the arm the same way .so i 'm slinging across here , come into wu sau , and break .again .all right .some basic defense against knife attacks .
so one of the reasons we 're doing this kind of large expanse of block color with just a little bit of texture is that this is a mural where i want to give it a lot of depth .so there will be a lot of detail on the tiger and the flowers and the rocks .and then this will disappear into the background .so i want to ...i do n't want it to be too busy .because if it was too busy it would be all on top of you. [CLS] [SEP]and then you would n't have that feeling of going off into the distance .
`` ok so now were going to get into the butterfly twist .the first part of the twist is , if you follow me over here , is basically the setup .so what basically anyone can set up for it in any different way , however i like to set up with my left leg behind my right leg and the key thing here. [CLS] [SEP]is you can stand with your feet together , you can stand with your legs apart , but the key thing for the set up is that you wind up your waist , is that you turn it .your going to move in a motion that helps you facilitate your 360 spin in the air .so what i like to do is start with my left leg back , right here .the arms can be anywhere you want but mainly in a motion that helps you tork backwards .so some people like to start like this .some people start with their hands over here .or some people just start like this .so i 'm going to start like this .looking backwards .i take a step out with my left leg .keeping my hands here .than i follow with my right leg , this way , so that now i am basically parallel to a line , an imaginary line this way , or as you can see i 'm parallel to the wall .this next part i will take a skip with. [CLS] [SEP], i 'll pivot my right foot and take a skip back with my left , like so .so that i 'm facing that direction again. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm in a front stance , a forward stance , so which. [CLS] [SEP]its going to lead me to the next movement .now let me just show you in sequence .so we wind up , take a step out with the left , move to the right the skip , until your in this position .now it 's very crucial that your chest is facing this directions , the direction that you came from , and it 's leaning over and all the weight is leaning over also onto your right leg .so as your chest is here that 's going to lead us to the next segment which is the dip .before we get into the dip. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm just going to do a little one but in a faster motion .ready !which is going to lead us to the next part .the dip .
one of the ways you can gain money or spend money is by going to the auction house .you 'll find an auctioneer and you can buy equipment like armor for example .you can buy , here you go. [CLS] [SEP], there 's different things like gold , there 's silver. [CLS] [SEP]and there 's copper .gold is of course the most valuable form of currency , silver is in the middle and copper is at the very bottom .now different people , when using professions will make equipment , or sometimes they will find equipment when they loot bodies like if the kill a monster .you know. [CLS] [SEP]and they get equipment from the body of that monster .they can sell it on the auction house , and of course to buy things on the auction house , you need money , and sometimes you need a lot of money .so , you can also gain money by using the auction house .when you kill monster 's and gain treasure or when you create items you can use those items to sell to other players and gain money that way .also there are a lot of vendors in the world of warcraft .they are people or other non player characters that sell things .sell things that you might need in order to complete your mission .like if we go down here , see if we got these two guys down here that are selling weapons .for example this guy sells clubs , and a short sword , two handed sword , he sells a variety of weapons but everything costs money .so if you have money you can buy stuff. [CLS] [SEP]and if you do n't well , you ca n't .
we have taken the selected scallion ; we will wash it thoroughly in water .remove the root part .take out ( unintelligible ) .as you see , it is quite grown up and ( unintelligible ) than the spring onion .the chopped scallion , it can be used as a garnish to the soup .it can be used in rice preparations .the scallion which has been cut diamondly , we can use them in noodles and in rice as well .they can go in the main course .only the precaution which we are to take while adding the scallion to main courses is that add them lately so that the color is retained and flavor is imparted .whereas , if you are to use the bulb of the spring onion .for certain rice preparation in asian cuisine the bulb is sliced and used for it. [CLS] [SEP]mainly the rice preparations. [CLS] [SEP]
okay in this advance technique i 'm going to show you another ploy to set up this submission .it is going to be elbow thrust , from his attempt to break my guard so remember this is guard , this is close guard. [CLS] [SEP]my feet are cross .the basic defense for him is to get his elbows in a force my legs apart .now when he does this i 'm going to defend , i 'm going to open my legs on purpose and this arm is going to sneak through. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to shove his wrist deep between my legs. [CLS] [SEP]and i swing the other leg over to get a elbow crush like a nut cracker .just like i did the knee crush .so once again he is here , i force and pull .
if you could not get to the store for a day , a week or even a month would you have food in your home , that you knew how to store .that would sustain your family with all the nutrients and minerals that you needed .i 'm going to tell you really quick what those 7 key foods are and how to. [CLS] [SEP]this black bean salsa plays that important part in a emergency food .first , of all again there is 7 key foods i do n't have one of them. [CLS] [SEP]cause we are not using them today but that is whole grain .that would be like wheat , barely , oats , rice , whole grains .another one that we are using today is leguminosae or beans .this here happens to be a pinto bean and right down here is a black bean. [CLS] [SEP]and we are using the black bean today .so any type of beans .the third ingredient that is really key is salt , then oil , water , powdered milk , and sugar or honey .we would talk more about that how the black bean salsa plays such a important part .
is the biofeedback certification of america or they have a website , www.bcia.org where you can go on-line and you can find out all the different types of biofeedback techniques that would be helpful that you could lean to help you deal with the headaches that you experience , whether it 's tension , cluster or migraine headaches .so biofeedback methods are just techniques to help reduce some of the physiological and biochemical affects that your body undergoes that causes the headache .for example , stress and anxiety are major causes for a lot of tension headaches that we experience in this population .so , if we can find ways to reduce your stress , find ways to relax and reduce anxiety in your body that would also help you to reduce at least the intensity or duration or the occurrence of headaches .and some of these techniques are. [CLS] [SEP]like i said , you can do visualization techniques where you can place yourself in um , visualize yourself in some kind of calming environment. [CLS] [SEP], you use all these images in your head .for example put yourself in a very calm place , quiet place and imagine that you are on a beach , and you can imagine the sand and the smells and that would help you reduce the stress or the anxiety at that moment you are experiencing and especially if you are going through the pain of the migraine at that time .and , so these are some of the ways of biofeedback that you could use to help you deal with the pain of headaches .
one of the common problems is a dirty carburetor from bad fuel or some water getting in there. [CLS] [SEP]and we ’ re going to take the carburetor out this one so that we can clean it .so what you want to do is go ahead and get a 5/16 tool on this mower and pull out the air filter. [CLS] [SEP]and then it ’ s also 5/16 , go ahead and remove the backing plate here. [CLS] [SEP]and then you got anywhere from one to two holes that are on your carburetor. [CLS] [SEP]and you can just take a pair of pliers and kind of just wobble them up , here you go .you have to make sure you are able to shut off the fuel , on this on it. [CLS] [SEP]actually has a fuel shut off. [CLS] [SEP]so then it won ’ t leak gas all over the place .so once you get the wheels off from the primer line , on this case on most don ’ t have a primer line but this one does. [CLS] [SEP]and then you want to go ahead and remove your carburetor .on this mower it ’ s a 3/8 bolt and then your carburetor will still be hanging there. [CLS] [SEP], you kind of just brush off and. [CLS] [SEP]then you have to turn it to the side here to get the linkage off the top here. [CLS] [SEP]and then there you have it .then you have your carburetor and obviously you can see that this one is very dirty and need to clean , which we ’ ll talk about in a little bit here .
first of all , every woman that is a working woman or just has some type of an occupation , you always want to have a like a nice larger tote .this is a bag that i travel a lot with , obviously there 's nothing in it at the moment. [CLS] [SEP]but you do want to have a larger bag to keep all your electronics and of course your laptop , whatever , but you do n't use this as your basic purse .i always recommend if you have a handbag that you 're using for business , have another bag to take with you that you can use during the day for lunch , meetings whatever as you 're zipping out the door .okay , so you always want to have one larger bag or satchel to put your electronics in , something that looks really professional .and of course you have a number of options you can go to a designer bag like this with some really great detailing to it , a lovely handbag , something with some color. [CLS] [SEP]and then not only for day. [CLS] [SEP]but you 've got evening .at the very least when you have an evening bag , the clutch is really , really popular .and this is a great clutch that i 'm showing you here because not only does it have that clutch opportunity. [CLS] [SEP]but also it has a little nice little chain handle right here .sorry , this is a little hard to get out at the moment .i just bought it as you can tell .but it has a little chanel-esque handle .and that 's a great little alternative .not only to use it as a clutch but as a little handbag itself .but you always want an everyday bag. [CLS] [SEP]and then you want a bag for evening .whether it be a little black beaded bag , a clutch or something in a satin in a really pretty bright color that you can wear and use day in and day out , okay ?so , handbags are really simple .you really want to have a selection of day and evening , something for professional , something for every day and something for evening .
in this clip , i 'm going to talk about the parts of a keyboard .here 's my keyboard , and these are the keys .this is where the music comes from ; the black keys or the white keys .now , where does the sound come from ?most keyboards have speakers .here 's a speaker on one side .here 's a speaker over here on the other side .now keyboards ; some are heavy , some are light .this is a pretty light one , and this is a stand .this is my keyboard stand which folds up really nicely , and i can take it to gigs .and this is my music stand which comes in or out if i want to use it or not use it , so i can put my sheets , my sheet music on there. [CLS] [SEP]and i can play my keyboard .so , you 've got your keys. [CLS] [SEP], you 've got your keyboard stand , your music stand , your speakers .this has been athena reich for the parts of a keyboard , in new york city .
here 's the principle .the eye tends to connect parts .so what you want to do , understanding that idea , is make sure that when you draw your c it has enough roundedness to it because it 's a rounded one story form , but that it 's open enough so that it does not read as an o.this part of the letter , its distinguishing characteristic part ,okay , but. [CLS] [SEP]basically also just the fact that it 's open here unlike the o.so this is how we know our c.this is how the c says i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]a c and not an o.distinguishing characteristic on the b is two bowls instead of. [CLS] [SEP]the one bowl that you 're going to see on the d. [CLS] [SEP]turn the card over , get our magic words , concentration , consciousness , connective .this word .the alphabet is very connected .what is the alphabet not connected to ?when you calligraph , when you write beautiful letters , what part of your brain are you not connecting to ?what part of your body ?it 's very , very connected .
some people who play strait whist like to indicate that you have to bid a certain minimum bid , say two or three .i 've seen variations where whoever the dealing side is , and this is one of the few times you 'll ever see the dealer at disadvantage , it is a rule requirement that somebody takes the hand for three , so if the opponents are really clever , it 's much easier to set or defeat a bid of three than it is to make a bid of three .why is that ?because you only need five tricks in your combined hands to defeat a contract of three .however , if you declare it for three , remember you have to make nine tricks .that 's not always easy , ok ?so please keep that in mind that if lose five tricks in a bid of three , so it 's much easier to set a bid of three .so what stick the dealer means is if you have a minimum bid of three. [CLS] [SEP]and you have very wily , clever opponents. [CLS] [SEP], they 'll go pass , and maybe your opponent 's got junk , so he 's warning you .now keep in mind too in the bidding that if your partner bids say one or a two , he 's telling you in front of you that he might have a little bit of help for you .unfortunately in whist , you ca n't tell your partner what suit you have or what direction you want to be going .you ca n't say three uptown , three downtown .you just basically have to bid a whole number , and there ?s a variation and some people allow to indicate that .i know in kiddie whist they do .and the other thing to keep in mind is that if this person passes you 're force to take it for three .you 'll have a lot tougher time making than you would defending against three .sticking the dealer means passing it around to the dealer , forcing him to bid three , and often times he 'll get set .that 's a strategy in the game .again , keep in mind , bidding process starts to the left of the dealer .dealer always has last bid .
what they do is that everybody that 's involved makes cards that are this size , 2 1/2 inches x. [CLS] [SEP]3 1/2 inches. [CLS] [SEP]and they 'll do them in all different kinds of medias. [CLS] [SEP]not just wax , all different kinds of media , but then they 'll trade with each other in groups all over the world .they do n't sell them .they just trade them one for one. [CLS] [SEP]and they create great big huge albums of work from all over the world. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's just a wonderful thing to get involved with .there 's also local groups that you can find that they meet together and work together to do this .so , what 's nice about this is that when you 're doing -- whatever art form , especially with wax , let 's say that you 've done something and you really like a little section of this painting that you 've done. [CLS] [SEP]but you do n't really like the rest of it. [CLS] [SEP], you can take this size , lay it over your artwork , draw it out and then cut out the section and have your little trading card piece that you can then offer to somebody else around the world .and you can just create a wonderful network in this way .
our trench is dug , three inches deep .the soil 's level , so now it 's time for us to dig the hole .first i 'm going to use this little shovel to mark out the area that i want to dig .now , i 'm going to start digging .now , we want the hole to be about twice as wide as the container .so , about up to here , and about up to here , and like this , and like this .that 'll create a nice rectangular hole .now , i 'll use the trowel to make the hole into a rectangle .using the smaller shovel helps us to really get the hole the dimensions that we want .okay .this looks about right .now , i 'm going to remove the plant from the container .now we can see the root ball .we want our whole to be this deep .alright , looks good .that 's how we 're digging our hole .
if you discover that you or your child has eczema , it 's really important to seek professional help for it because a dermatologist , for example , can tell you exactly how to treat it , prevent it , and just to keep a very good skin care regime .i know that , i laugh saying that i spend more time on my daughter 's skin than i do myself , because we want to make sure that she stays eczema free .it 's not fun to have eczema .it 's very irritating .we go through many band-aids , especially on my daughter 's fingers because of the itchiness .when you 're dealing with eczema , whether it 's yourself or your child , i strongly recommend seeing a dermatologist .a dermatologist is a professional who deals with these things , skin disorders , and things like that , on a regular basis .they know exactly what your child needs , or what you need , to prevent and take care of your skin care .when my daughter has an extreme flare up. [CLS] [SEP]we end up seeing the dermatologist. [CLS] [SEP], it 's a pediatric one , and they 're able to give us the right amount of medication , something that 's safe for her skin .with steroids and cortisone creams , you 're a little leery about putting that on your skin because it does have a thinning effect if you use it long term .so , the key is , to treat the flare up , use as minimal medication as possible , and just keep a great skin care regime. [CLS] [SEP]so you do n't have to use these medications .it 's good to have them on hand though and also have professional help when you need it .
hi , i 'm going to demonstrate a compound exercise of a `` warrior '' pose and a single arm lateral raise .what this is going to work is your hamstrings and your glute on the balancing leg , and the shoulders and mid-deltoids specifically in the opposite arm .so we 're going to stabilize first , take the band , preferably a medium resistance band which is your green band .place it underneath the arch of your foot as opposed to the ball of your foot. [CLS] [SEP], so you want to make sure that that does n't come off and hit you .you 've got more resistance on your left hand and less on your right , so you want the right side to be very long , the left side to be short .place that band right on your hip , hinge forward , if you need a little support on the floor , keep your left foot on the floor .as you hinge forward , bodyweight transfers into your hamstrings and glute , lengthen , reach up to shoulder level , and then come back down with your lateral raise .so what we want to look for is , up to shoulder level and down .to make this harder , you 're going to stabilize right in the middle of the body , lengthen up , lengthen that leg all the way up , stabilizing through the core .you 're just going to hold that position , pull the arm out , drop it down towards your knee , lift and lower .so nice and slow , stabilize the body , make sure the knee does n't go over your toe .once you find your stability in your core , hold it here. [CLS] [SEP]you start moving the arm .and it 's exhale as you lift and inhale as you lower .nice and smooth range of motion , try not to jerk any motion in your neck , again if you feel like you are losing your balance , re-adjust , lift and lower .option is to drop the foot on the floor and continue on .we want to try to do between eight and twelve repetitions and two to three sets .finish one side and then go on to the other side .and that is how we do a `` warrior '' pose with a lateral raise , single arm .make sure you do opposite arm to opposite leg and it will be a good one .
utkatasana intense pose , or chair pose , can be just that , very intense , very intense on your thighs .so , we 're going to have faith demonstrate this using the block , which will help you learn how to use your thighs properly to put your back and spine in alignment , and hopefully make the pose a little bit easier for you .so , we 're going to ask faith to stand nice and tall .good .she 's going to place the block in between her legs .good .then , she 's going to press firmly into all four corners of her feet , spreading her toes .good .she 's going to inhale , lift up through her chest , and as she exhales , she 's just gon na , squeezing the block , drop her hips back and reach her arms forward .good .now , we want to make sure that her -- go ahead and do it the other way -- her tailbone is n't up. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's compressing her spine .so , she 's going to press her tailbone down , and see how that lengthens up , so she has one long line of energy from the tailbone to the crown of her head , also drawing her belly button in .she 's squeezing her thighs together which internally rotates the thighs -- good -- and helps her hold that position even longer .the weight is in heels so she should be able to lift up her toes , and she should be able to see her toes .if her knees are far forward over her toes , then you need to move your knees back , so you can see your toes , squeezing through your thighs , drawing your belly button in , and that 's a beautiful , intense pose .
so , this is the second leg that we 're going to do. [CLS] [SEP]and like i told you before , on this leg we 're going to actually cut off the excess fabric and maybe a lot of you out there. [CLS] [SEP]have pants that have a lot of excess fabric on the inside. [CLS] [SEP]but you still want the original hem .i 'll show you how to go in sew it and cut it off and tack it up also .so , this is what we 've already done .you know it 's not in very much fabric and if you have this much fabric , you can just tack it up but say if you had let see maybe something like four inches of extra fabric which mean that you will take up the pant eight inches .you 'll never know .that 's a lot of fabric to be inside of a pant. [CLS] [SEP]so then we will want to cut it off and tack it up like this .so , in this pair of pants , we 're going to hem it three in a half inches and cut it off and tack it up. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to show you how to do that .
ok , we 've painted our board for our decoupage mirror .i have two coats of acrylic paint on here. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to let that dry over night to make sure that its really dry fully .your going to need two decorator napkins for this project .the first napkin will open up and we 'll decoupage , we will be decoupaging the back of the mirror first .so you want to see on the napkin if there is any design element that you want to place on the back of your mirror in any particular way .so maybe a certain swirl or a flower or something that you like on the napkin that you want to display .so you want to lay the napkin over and just look around and see what is the prettiest place to place the napkin and then very carefully turn it over and trace around .now this is before you separate your napkin. [CLS] [SEP]you want to trace around with a pencil you do n't want to use a marker because you do n't want the ink to go through and discolor your decorator napkin .so were using a pencil to trace around and then you 'll cut a quarter inch all the way around outside of your tracing mark and that will be a little bit to go around and to just over lap the side of your hand mirror .
`` the best way to explain the first three stages of matter is to talk about an ordinary ice cube .an ice cube is a solid ; you ca n't stick your finger through it .this is when the atoms are compacted tightly together , but when the ice cube melts it becomes a liquid and this is when the atoms are spaced further apart and the object takes the only shape that it 's contained in , and in this case it 's a cup .this is when the intermolecular bonds start to break down .so in this case the liquid is obviously called water .the atoms linked are hydrogen and oxygen .get it ?h2o , two parts of hydrogen , one part of oxygen , which is from our periodic table that were going to get to .these are all down to the bones of atoms .when the water evaporates , obviously , it becomes gas . [CLS] [SEP]''
we add the egg we got the jicama. [CLS] [SEP]the holy trinity everything in there , so now it 's time to add the crab. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're using the claw meat from the crab. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to put this in to our dressing .we picked through this to make sure we did n't have any shells in there now that we put our crab meat in were no longer whisking we 're just going to fold that crab meat in .because we really do n't want it to break up to much. [CLS] [SEP]so the whisk will probably be to violent ,so we 're going to use a spoon just fold that crab meat in incorporating it into that dressing .make sure we get everything mixed in there. [CLS] [SEP]and we can see the colors from the yellow bell pepper as well as the red onion. [CLS] [SEP]the red bell pepper , the green bell pepper. [CLS] [SEP]so we got our crab meat folded in and lets move on to our next step .
then we have to take 13 eggs , crack them open , and put them inside the batter as it gets mixed .we 'll let it mix for a while .we have to stir the eggs before they get in there .just separate them as much as we can .pour them inside and let them mix with the batter .then we have to take one pound of butter , put it in the pan , and heat it up .the batter has to run down and then we have to cool it off. [CLS] [SEP]so it will not tighten up the eggs inside the batter .
now i 'm a label. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm looking for a producer .well what can you do ?what can you offer ?my label 's looking for producers depends on i might be looking for somebody who can just come in here and lay down hot tracks. [CLS] [SEP]24/7 , 365 days a year .is that you ?i might be looking for somebody that can engineer that can come in here and run the sound and make sure that my artist sounds critique , crisp , clean , show all the ability that they can sound .comes to production i might need somebody that 's just a vocal trainer and that can just produce my singers and just bring out the best sound in their voice .when a label is looking for a producer they look for variables and things .so you have to be willing to say exactly what kind of producer you are .because when labels are looking for producers they know exactly what they want .so you have to know exactly who you are and are you capable of giving that label exactly what it is they 're looking for .so when labels are looking for a producer make sure you check into that job description .make sure you know the details of exactly what it is the label 's looking for .because like i mentioned production comes with many things .producers has many different titles and jobs that they do and these are things that you want to know before you get yourself involved or committed to one of these things just like i said .so keep this in mind and know what it is you want to do before you go in an try to be a producer for a major label .
let 's play our b melodic minor scale once again ; 1st scale degree b , c sharp 2nd scale degree ; half sets between 2 and 3. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's a d natural 3rd. [CLS] [SEP], 4th are e natural whole step away from 3rd .now let 's go over our 5th scale degree which is an f sharp o.k .; let 's play it with our 2nd high 2nd finger on the d string between o.k . [CLS] [SEP]our 4th scale degree. [CLS] [SEP]e natural and our 5th. [CLS] [SEP]which is f natural is a whole step .
what you want to do , is do your research , and insurance companies are the companies that do manage annuities .what you can do is go on to rating services on the web .the best rating services to check out are standard and poor 's , you can just basically google that and get standard and poor 's .there 's also the best rating agency , just like it sounds ,best , there 's moody 's , and there 's also fitch , f-i-t-c-h.if you find an insurance professional and he 's licensed , he should be able to provide all the ratings from the best insurance companies for you .then you can independently verify the ratings that you were given by the insurance commissioner in the state that you live .of course , you can call the insurance commissioner and verify the company by name and they will tell you what the ratings are and if there 's any problems with that company for operating in the state that you live in .ratings are very important because it shows the reserve of capital that the insurance company has for the amount of policies and annuities that it has outstanding .the higher the rating , the higher the reserves which means the more safety that you have using your annuities .this is patrick munro talking about the very best ratings of insurance companies .
so if we take and use our imaginations and pretend that we 've got ten dollars in each of containers .one drop of soap representing a dollar bill , and we try to even those out just to try to get the same amount of suds representing cleaning power , we 'll go eleven , twelve , thirteen , we 'll go thirty dollars versus ten dollars .again , i 'm simply trying to get the same amount of suds in each one of these containers representing cleaning power .so three times the amount of soap and we still do n't get as good suds , and notice the clarity of those two waters .which water would you rather bathe in ?which water would you rather have your children bathe in ?which water would you rather have in your home ?that is where that ring in your bathtub comes from .that 's where that soap scum build up comes from .that 's where all of those problems are .the spots on your dishes .the ring in your toilet .all of those things are coming from your quality of water or are effected by your quality of water anyway .
so let 's talk about how to mark your line for the depth that you want to fish at .and this is used when you 're using tip-ups .so we 've sounded our hole .the sounder is on the bottom right now. [CLS] [SEP]so we know exactly how deep it is .so what i 'm going to do , i 'm going to hold that line in my finger .and typically when you 're ice fishing most people fish 2-3-4 feet off the bottom .so we 've got that .so we 're going to estimate 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 feet .i 'm going to hold that .i 'm actually going to hold it in my mouth because it 's easier .and then i 'm going to bring up my line , set that aside for now .and this is the depth that i want to fish at .this is where i want the line to be on my reel .so there 's a number of different ways to do that .one you can tie a very simple slip knot , and just reel your line up to that point .however , when a fish takes it , often that knot comes out .so there 's another way to do it .and that entails just having a small bobber , on your line , that you put at the point where you want to fish at .and then the other option , some people actually thread a button onto their line .that works very well .what i like to do is just to simply tie the slip knot that we talked about , and then just insert a match stick into it .and tighten that knot down .again that 's where you reel your line up to .when you catch a fish , and you want to re-bait and fish some more , you know exactly what depth you were fishing at , and where you want to set that line out again .when you 're done for the day , slip out the match stick , throw it away , take out your slip knot , and you 're ready to fish the next time .
a lot of people want ways to keep their dog from barking .they call me on the phone and they say , please help me my dog is barking. [CLS] [SEP], i want my dog to stop barking .well it 's a little bit tricky because it 's a lot easier to teach your dog what to do instead of what not to do .so first and foremost thing you need to do is work with your dog about barking issues is to reinforce and reward silence .make quietness a really cool thing for your dog to do .another thing to do is to teach your dog to do another behavior besides barking .in terms of barking you really need to figure out , what it is that 's causing your dog to bark .and you need to train your dog around each and every one of the barking triggers .so a lot of dogs bark , bark , bark , bark , bark when somebody comes to the door .and one of the most effective ways to teach your dog what to do when people come to the door , come on , come here. [CLS] [SEP]is to teach go get your toy .go get your toy .get your toy .bring it here , come on .good girl .so a dog that 's walking around with a toy in his mouth is usually not barking he 's doing something else .so go get your toy .alright .another good way to start teaching your dog what to do when people come in is to take your dog and put your dog on a tie down .what i have here on the floor is a little , is a floor tie down , you can do this by putting the eye ring in a stud in your wall ok.and as soon as somebody comes to the door , here come here , come on puppy .lolly come .good .put your dog on the tie down and as people come in give your dog treats .good dog , thank you .you are being so quiet when people come in .that is so good .a dog that is eating something and paying attention to you , is not barking .and for almost anything that your dog does that you do n't like , cookie therapy is a very , very , very good approach to take .
one of the poses that really works great in partner yoga is spinal twisting and it helps to have your partner. [CLS] [SEP]and it feels really great .we are going to come back to back .we 're going to do a little back to back twist here .we 're going to take our hands down next to our hips , lengthening down through the spine and rooting down into the ground , inhale , reach the arms up , pressing your shoulders down even as you reach your arms up realigning your spine .now as you exhale you 're going to open your arms out just shoulder height .you 're going to find your partner 's palms and press into your partner 's shoulders a bit .roll your shoulders back. [CLS] [SEP]so you feel your shoulder blades touching your partner .inhaling again and lengthen and as you exhale you 're going to come in to a rotation and keep the connection with your partner 's shoulder blades and do n't allow your shoulders to come up to your ears , keep them pressed down nicely , good .inhale rotate back to the center and exhale. [CLS] [SEP]rotate over to the other direction pressing into your partner 's palms and feeling your partner 's shoulder blades , inhale back to center and exhale over to the other side .good , inhale , lengthen and exhale , twist .good , releasing back inhale reaching the arms up to the sky and exhale drawing the energy into heart center .
now i 'll show you how i 'm going to do that right now .you have to kinda eyeball the paper .we already know where the center is , so i 'm going to start from the top , work my way down .now , you 'll notice i 'm left-handed .it does n't matter if you 're left- or right-handed .the procedure is the same .besides , the lord made everybody right-handed , only a few could overcome it .that 's one of my favorite sayings .now , i want to look and see here .i can see that this dimension is shorter on this side , so i want to extend that a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]so i come up with a totally even cross on all four sides .you can kind of gauge it by looking at an angle this way .you can see this side is short .now that i 've got the cross , i 'll split the difference between the two and draw it right down straight , like that .now , come over to the other side and do the same .when you 're first starting off , it 's always good to draw it slow ; that way , you get a pretty even tail .if you draw them fast , your drawing can get messed up .and you want to draw slow and straight as possible and get a straight line .so that 's the first stage of making our drawing .
well , i 'm kind of liking our lava planet now , but , you know what ?i think i 'm going to make it the sun of this little solar system. [CLS] [SEP]we 're creating here .so , let 's look at it here .what we 're going to do is , we 're going to select on it here .and let 's go ahead and select our pick tool there .there we go .we have our layers selected , like this .and what we 're going to do is , we 're just going to go. [CLS] [SEP]ahead-let 's go and. [CLS] [SEP]do a-let 's do a blending option here .oops .double-click here .let 's give this an outer glow , and quite an outer glow .let 's go over here .if we select on it , you can see .we 've got a color here selected .i do n't really like this .well , i do n't know .let 's see .let 's see how this color comes out .let 's see if we can spread that outer glow out a little bit .there we go .there 's a nice , soft texture for this .let 's see if we can get this in a different contour .the contour will adjust for us here .there we go .once again , this is all playing with it , getting it to. [CLS] [SEP]-this is where your artistic ability comes in-getting it to something that you really like .i think maybe that looks fine there .go ahead , and we 'll go ahead and hit `` ok. [CLS] [SEP]''and let 's change this color .i 'm really not liking this color too much , so let 's go back to our orangish color , like so .that 's a little bit too much .let 's bring it down a little bit .there we go .i like that .there we go .now , of course , you can add , you know , more with your techniques here-a softer , precise , blah , blah , blah .all kinds of options here just for you to play with .we 're just going to hit `` ok '' with that .and i definitely like that .so let 's go ahead and take him-let 's go ahead and position him up in the corner here because i 'm very partial to where my sun is located at .we 'll go ahead , `` shift . [CLS] [SEP]''oops .control-z .let 's grab the corner one here as i hit `` shift . [CLS] [SEP]''let 's bring this up , and there he is , positioned .there is our lava planet/sun .so , there we go .let 's keep on going and see what else we can make on this scene .
how to draw a cartoon monkey .start with a circle .make the eyes come out of the circle .make the eyes look any which way you want .give him a bottom lip .now make the head come out from around there .give him a little bit of a nose right there .ears on the side .and there is our basic monkey .now all you have got to do is give him the body .here 's the neck .you can give him kind of squiggly arms to show that he is being silly .arms kind of dancing around .now most monkeys a lot of them have longer arms than their hind legs .so do n't forget that .give him a round oval right there for his belly. [CLS] [SEP]and he can be with or without tail .and there we have our monkey .
okay , the drink we 're about to make is called ethnic sugar .and first thing we 'll do is put some ice in a glass , and we 're going to measure out two shots of cuantreau .there 's one , and two .look at that .just enough left .okay , now we 're going to measure out one shot of tequila , any tequila will do .and we 're going to do about four ounces of coca-cola .oops .and also , some kool-aid , here we go .just about a teaspoon of kool-aid .and last , we will add some surge cola .and if you just pretty much a dash , all the way to the top .okay , let 's mix all these ingredients together , and this should be a nice , sweet drink to enjoy .that 'll do it .grab your glass .if you have a beer mug , you can serve this in a beer mug , otherwise , a pint glass will do .add a straw , and bottoms up .
alright , what we 're going to do is we 're going to go ahead and finish up with our text here .as we can see here , i have my darkness copy up like so .what i 'm going to do is i 'm just going to go ahead and copy this , like so .we 'll turn that copy off. [CLS] [SEP]we 'll use that one later .what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to select my copy here by holding down my command key and selecting it like so .i 'm going to go to filter. [CLS] [SEP], oops let 's go to enter. [CLS] [SEP]always choose the right layer first , ha ha .let 's go to filter , stylize , glowing edges .and it 's going to say we have to rosterize our text which is fine with me .what we 're going to do is we 're going to set this up to where , we 're going to say edge with two , we 're going to use edge brightness at fourteen and smoothness at four .we 're going to go ahead and say ok.now this did n't really do much so we 're going to apply it again by hitting command f , and you can see , command d.but it 's applied it pretty well. [CLS] [SEP], let 's do it one more time .alright , that looks pretty good like so .now what we 're going to do is we 're going to hit filter , let 's go to blur and let 's radial blur this .now i 'm going to use zoom and quality best here .let 's take our amount , let 's take it all the way up to one hundred and see what happens .alright , that 's looking pretty good .so what we 're going to do is we 'll pause here. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll pick this up in the next part .
the last thing i want to talk about with regards to social differences that you need to be aware of when you 're dealing with people from other cultures is time .and what i 'm talking about with regards to time is primarily has to do with punctuality .here in america , it 's what we strive for , what is indicative of our culture is to be on time or sometimes on time means five minutes early .but in many , many cultures , being on time means ten minutes late .if we 're supposed to meet at 2:00 , then on time is 2:10 or 2:15 and some cultures. [CLS] [SEP]it 's even later than that .but it 's real important that you follow the culture 's cultural differences with regards to time .but you want to make sure you know what you 're talking about .if you have a business meeting at 2:00 , that 's really not going to start until 2:15 because that 's what 's indicative of that culture .you might want to still be there at 2:00 because that 's , you want to be there .what you have to not do is get upset when the other group of people shows up at 2:15.it also has to do with the length of time .here in america , a business lunch for us is an hour .in other cultures , a business lunch might be three hours .so be real aware of the time sensitivity of the culture that you 're going to be working with .
i grew up there. [CLS] [SEP]and i know , you know , this --i 'm biased , definitely , but it is -- you 're going to have an amazing array of flavors , colors .i adore the food and it 's amazing .just be very careful .once you get there , i know some people want to be very daring , but avoid certain things like unwashed greens .you know , we do n't want you getting sick at all , but the food it is so good .you can go to a small market and get a wonderful soup , beef soup , chicken soup or hen soup. [CLS] [SEP], i mean , we have hundreds and hundreds of different soups from all the local places .or if you can spare some money , you can go to a really nice hotel and have probably a wonderful dinner with all-you-can-eat buffet of different dishes from all over .but remember , every region in peru has different type of cuisine .because of the high mountains , it 's always hard for the peruvians to get all the -- the transportation is very , very difficult , so. [CLS] [SEP]what you eat in the highlands , you do n't eat it by the coast .let 's say for example , in the highlands , it 's very , very popular to have guinea pig , cuy. [CLS] [SEP], it 's a delicatessen .you know , some people may say that 's not , but it actually tastes great and with different herbs and potatoes. [CLS] [SEP], it 's awesome .but by the coast , you can have ceviche , that 's ceviche 's fresh fish , marinated in lime or endless seafood , that 's amazing .and if you have to go to the jungle , then you can try all kind of bananas and different type of river fish , but my suggestion is try .i mean , you wo n't disappointed ; they are incredible .and just -- you can take a look , go to a library , pick some books , try to figure out what sounds good or not , and if you already sort of have an idea before going. [CLS] [SEP], i think it 's going to be much a more pleasant experience .
now , costumes are just things that you wear , but actually , you have to get more into the spirit of being a cat .first off , are you going to try to be ultra agile throughout the evening ?if so , i recommend stretching before you leave .it sounds a little silly , but i have heard of people who were in costumes where the animal is supposed to be more agile , and then all of a sudden they pull out their back or they strain a muscle in their left arm .definitely , make sure you 're not one of those people .if you 're going to be expecting to be really stretching and moving all around , stretch before you go out .you can also start getting your cat mannerisms down .you see the way that cats move .how they stretch certain ways and also how they lick their paws .all of those things .kind of go over .this is a little bit of role you 're going to be playing .while you may look the part , if you 're walking around totally like a human , it 's just not as much fun .of course , do not under emphasis the all important cat activity of scratching .
the foot position that you 'll need for an ollie to a rock and roll fakie is basically going to be very similar to the average ollie foot position .the only difference is , when you do an ollie into a rock and roll , you do n't really have to drag your foot up like you do on flat grounds .when you 're on transition , you kind of drag the bottom of your foot. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's a little more of a general kind of feeling in directing the board on the top of the coping .so your back foot is going to want to be actually just above the back wheels , or the back two sets of bolts , on the back truck .your front foot is going to want to be in a general nose position .not like a street ollie , where you put your toe on the tip of the nose , but in a very general flat position .so you 've got your foot over the back truck , and this nose right here in the general position .what you 're going to want to do , is center your weight in the center of those two places .and you 're going to want to lean slightly back , just before you get to the coping .what this is going to do , is get the pop against your wheels hitting the coping and able to leave the surface , and have control , and then land and be ready to bring yourself back into the rock position .`` cause you 're going to want to make sure that after you get into it , that you 're able to get back onto your tail , to be able to rock back in .'cause if you 're stuck on the top of the ramp too far ahead , you 'll lock in .
chinese writing is very different from most other languages in the world .in the chinese writing system , chinese symbols represent each character which corresponds to a single spoken syllable .a majority of words in all modern varieties of chinese require two or more characters to write .many chinese characters were adopted according to their meaning by the japanese and korean languages to represent native words , disregarding pronunciation altogether .chinese characters are also considered to be the world 's longest continuously used writing system .
and today we 're going to be talking about managing the spring hoop house .there 's a lot to a hoop house because each square inch has so much potential .so we 're out here early in the season , we have to take care of planting and watering the over wintered crops , harvesting , almost daily come spring .there 's venting issues on a daily basis .harvesting , succession cropping , planting new things to take the place of the older plants that have seen their day .if you 're not out in the hoop house on a daily basis , you might just fall behind , so this is really a hobby for someone who is intensively in love with horticulture and permaculture food growing .i can show you some of the plants that we have going in here and. [CLS] [SEP]in just a minute we 're going to get down and show you our picking technique for mixed salad greens .
today we 're going to draw animals .first thing you want to think about is what kind of animal you 're about to draw .now if it 's a , if it 's a giraffe you 're going to want to turn your pad straight up vertical .if it 's a wiener dog you might want to turn it sideways .the same thing with a giraffe , if you have a vertical piece of paper you better draw the biggest part of your giraffe first , so you draw the body .and then you want to think about where the head 's going to go next .o.k .if you draw your body way up at the top of your page , you 're not going to have any room for your head .so draw your head and you 've got your giraffe .then you 've got enough room for this giraffe this way .it 's a wiener dog. [CLS] [SEP]you 're going to turn your page sideways .the body is long but you still have to leave room for his head , o.k .and the four legs are short little legs. [CLS] [SEP]so you do n't want to put the body too close to the bottom. [CLS] [SEP]but you do n't have to put it too close to the top either ,o.k .but the one thing to think about is also what makes that animal what he is .now wiener dog 's real easy , he 's just a long dog .a giraffe , easy too .it 's a very tall animal .but if you 're drawing a horse what makes that horse a horse ?is it the body ?or one thing very specific to a horse is the hooves .the tail has got all kinds of stuff on it .and the neck ; curved neck .the head is made in three , three parts and has pointy ears .and also the head and the tail ; to me a horse is all about the mane and the hooves , and the nose .that right there you know is a horse , even though you have n't fleshed out eyes or anything else .so the things to think about , one is spatial arrangement , which which direction you turn your page .also what makes this wiener dog a wiener dog , the length ?or this giraffe. [CLS] [SEP]a giraffe , the height or maybe spots too .or a horse a horse ?and that would be a mane , hooves and a tail .maybe the nose too .and that 's how you draw animals .
do not try to bow on the teeth side , because you 're not going to have a bow very long .some people prefer to hold the saw the opposite way with the teeth facing the audience , and bowing again , where there are no teeth .some people like to reach the high notes by bending the blade down , whereas some bend it while holding it up without the need to bend the entire body down .the sound is the same .

one of the most important tools we carry as firefighters is the flat headed axe .the flat headed axe is not only a cutting tool , it is also a striking tool much like a sledgehammer .the flat headed axe enables us to use this tool in conjunction with a halligan tool to do forcible entry techniques .married together. [CLS] [SEP]they form what we call the irons .and the flat headed axe is a great tool to use when hammering the backside of the halligan tool into place for forcible entry reasons .the blade side of the axe can be used for cutting through roofing material to ventilate a structure .it can be used to break out glass for ventilation purposes or for an additional means of egress to find your way out of the building .or it can be used to cut through dry wall or plaster material in case. [CLS] [SEP]we need to find a secondary means of egress by breaching through a wall or opening it up to find hidden spots of fire for overhaul purposes .married together with the halligan tool , the flat headed axe forms our set of irons that are carried as such .the irons and the flat headed axe are the two great tools to carry as a firefighter .
now i 'm going to show you petrissage on the upper leg in the supine position .after we 've done our effleurage we move into a deeper stroke called petrissage .we apply oil .these are major muscle groups , great stroke for runners to really get into these muscles when they 're sore .petrissage is a great technique to increase your circulation and get deeper into the muscle fibers .so , i 'm going to start with a pick up petrissage .i 'm going to either side of the leg , pick up squeeze , pick up and squeeze .really use your leg muscles to do this so you do n't strain your wrist .i 'm going to move down softly , glide up and squeeze .down , up and squeeze .then i can do my kneading on the adductors , and on the quads , and i can even do it down here on the adductors near the it band .feels great around the knee , kneading around the attachments of the knee .i can also do knuckling .pushing the tissue , moving up towards the heart , soft wrist , using this part of my hand , bending into the stroke .that 's petrissaging the upper leg in supine .
alright when , when we 're going to , we 're going to shape this moquette and there 's really not that much throwing involved as there is pinching , and pulling because it 's such a small piece of clay. [CLS] [SEP]you do n't really throw .but we 're going to make just a little pot belly guy .i 'm going to go ahead , i 'm going to pinch the bottom , i 'm going to bring it up in cylinder .i 'm going to leave enough clay there. [CLS] [SEP]so i can make a little rim .i 'm going to leave enough clay there. [CLS] [SEP]so i can make a little bay or a little belly ; i 'll establish my base again. [CLS] [SEP]so i know where the bottom 's at , i 'm going to see how much clay i have by feeling it. [CLS] [SEP]and i have about that much clay , that much thickness to work with .so i got to keep that in mind when i 'm pulling and pushing all this clay around. [CLS] [SEP]so i do n't go past the point of no return , and flop my maquette ; my moquette .so once i 've pulled that up and established my cylinder. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to go ahead. [CLS] [SEP]flatten the top again to keep everything in check .and now we 're going to put some form in there .
first we have one step , which will help break up bio matter and also sanitize. [CLS] [SEP]were you do n't have to rinse and you can use that at a rate of one tablespoon per gallon .you also have five star , which you can use at a rate of one ounce per five gallons and this will help sanitize your equipment .finally we have iodo four and you can use this at a rate of one tablespoon for five gallons. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's a very affective and cheap sanitizer .at this point brewing process you need to clean all of your equipment , but in particular you need to sanitize , which is the extra level of cleaning your primary fermenter and if you actually gone with the glass carbonate , you need to sanitize your filter as well .as well as your air lock , your rubber stoppers and anything else that will be touching the beer. [CLS] [SEP]after is has gone cold .later in the brewing process , you 'll need to sanitize all of your racking equipment as well as your bottles , bottling bucket and anything else that will be touching the beer after it 's cold .whatever you choose for your cleanser and your sanitizer , i recommend filling up a bucket with it. [CLS] [SEP]so you can dip all of your equipment in there as needed .
this norwegian print features a troll playing a saw .over here , we have some samples of musical figurines , books mentioning the musical saw , cds .i have a whole slue of collectables of the musical saw on my website including newspaper clips from the 1920s advertising the musical saw .
hi , i 'm travis corpening , and i 'm about to teach you how to do a two-handed dump .lets have some fun .alright , first of all , we 're here in beautiful carolina beach , north carolina , their wonderful facility , we want to thank them for allowing us to use it .getting down to the actual foot work of doing and completing a two-handed dunk , what i want to first tell you is , when you take off , some jumpers , you have different taste , some jumpers like to take off on two feet. [CLS] [SEP], some jumpers can take off on one , but whichever your flavor .what you want to do is , when you do take off , if you 're a one legged jumper , you want to plant with the opposite hand , if you 're right handed , you want to plant with the left leg , if you 're left handed. [CLS] [SEP]you want to plant with the right leg .what you want to do , you want to plant , and once you plant , you immediately bounce and take off , once you take off- now if you 're doing a tomahawk dunk , the difference in a tomahawk dunk and just a regular slam , a regular two-handed dunk is a tomahawk- a regular slam you actually just kind of can get away with putting it in once you take off , once you get up there above the rim .but a tomahawk you actually want to take it , bring it back here , and that 's a little advance for a little more advance jumpers. [CLS] [SEP], you want to take it back here , and kind of get some hang time. [CLS] [SEP]so it looks really cool , and then you bring it down with authority .a two-handed dunk you can pretty much bring it down with authority too , but a tomahawk two-handed dunk looks a little cooler .so , you want to try it , go ahead give it a shot , once you do try it. [CLS] [SEP]and you can get up above the rim enough to where you can complete it. [CLS] [SEP], you might want to add a little flair to it , maybe some different styles using the legs .if you look at michael jordan in the way he dunks , as oppose to colby bryant , you 'll see their own individual flair .but there you have it , two-handed dunk .
now , we 're going to discuss marsh flitter .marsh flitter is a very powerful card , is out of the lorwyn block , is an uncommon , it is a creature - faerie rogue .now , once again , the lorwyn set is trying to specifically build up the creature types of faeries and merfolk , and costs you 3 and a black to play .three and a black to play and you 're playing a 1/1 .now , once again , you 're paying four in converted mana cost for a 1/1 , means there 's going to be , at least one really cool ability , or a few really cool abilities .now , in this case , this creature has flying , means it can only be blocked by creatures with flying and/or reach , and it also has when marsh flitter comes into the play , put two 1/1 black goblin rogue creature tokens into play .so , when you play him , you 're getting two extra 1/1 creatures , which means that basically , getting their equivalent of a 3/3 , which makes them even mana production , and now , you are actually going to get a free ability , as long as flying is also a free ability , but you 're going to get an extra free ability , and this ability is sacrificing goblin .marsh flitter becomes a 3/3 until end of turn .so , now you can sacrifice a goblin that came into play , to make him a 3/3 during any turn you choose .it 's a very powerful card .
let 's do shomen now , straight overhead .this cut did n't get him , this cut did n't get him , they 're really good , they 're backing off now .we 'll cut shomen which is a nice overhead cut to the , overhead strike to the head .one , two , three. [CLS] [SEP], i cut this. [CLS] [SEP]and i do n't want to let it bounce per say ,but i do n't want to spend a lot of time and. [CLS] [SEP]then try to reset myself .it 's a quick motion , up. [CLS] [SEP]i go , shomen .this person 's being pretty hard to deal with .defensive , kesa giri , kesa giri , shomenuhci .if anything even if i 'm not able to make successful cuts , i 'm still driving them back .you want to be assertive ; you do n't want to be overly aggressive because as you do that you expose yourself as well .it has to be harmony of all things in this , you have to be harmonious with the attacks , this is a fluid motion .i 'm one , two , three and shomen .that 'll take us this far in ken ji two .
so you want to get centered with your pot. [CLS] [SEP]o.k .because you want this to sit back properly .so what you got to do is find a nice clean spot on your work table and just do it like that , like that and like that .right now because it 's wet it , it wo n't sit on. [CLS] [SEP]it 's own. [CLS] [SEP]but that 's the angle that i want it to sit on .you can see , probably better that way .so that 's the angle that we want it to sit on .i think it 's way cool. [CLS] [SEP], you do n't see too many pitchers that kick it like that. [CLS] [SEP]and once this dries it 'll stay nice and flat like that ; it wo n't roll. [CLS] [SEP]but you can put support in there while it dries , alright .
we 've already shown how we get the snap and take the appropriate steps .now we 're ready to approach the ball .let 's go through this slow on how to drop this down ( video demo ) .we 've caught the ball ; take your steps and then stop .now he 's ready to approach the kick .you can see that he 's holding the ball out in front of him .he 's not going to take the ball , throw it up in the air and then try to let his foot find the ball .we want to bring the foot to the ball and have them meet .this will give you a good pocket to kick in .notice that everything is balanced .everything is going toward the area that he 's kicking it to .he 's not kicking the ball backward .instead , he 's approaching the ball ; everything is coming straight through when he makes the kick .let 's kick one away. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 'll show what a pooch kick looks like ( video demo ) .he catches the ball , he steps in , the approach , he keeps his head down looking at the ball .you do n't want to lift your head up and then try to make the kick .there is one last kick you make if you 're going to try to pooch kick .you do n't have a lot of room and you want to try to get the ball up higher. [CLS] [SEP]and you do n't want it go quite as far .you 'll hold the ball a little different .first of all you 'll tilt the ball backward .you do n't want to kick it and explode through it , instead , you want to get it up a little more .also , the extension on the leg is not so much exploding out through the ball .you 're going to bend it a little more in order to get the ball up a little higher .that 's the way you explode through a kick and. [CLS] [SEP]the way you can pooch kick to keep it in a shorter distance and get a little more height on it .
you may want to introduce your seasoning to the food separately. [CLS] [SEP]but i like to premix my seasoning because i 'm going to use it throughout the meal .and i do n't use a measuring spoon i normally just measure from my hand. [CLS] [SEP]i know exactly how much i 'm need .i 'm gon na start off with garlic powder , at that end , then i like use sea salt or sometimes couture salt into that about a teaspoon , black pepper , i 'm gon na add a little red pepper because thats just my creole roots. [CLS] [SEP]and i like to add a little spice to it. [CLS] [SEP]you can leave it out. [CLS] [SEP]that 's up to you .i also like to add just a little sweet basil and a bit of aragono .and you mix that up. [CLS] [SEP]and this is the seasoning that we will use up season our chicken and to season our flour also that were going to use. [CLS] [SEP]and then there you have it .
okay , were ready to bake our baked alaska .we are going to remove it from the freezer and just for ease. [CLS] [SEP]i put it on the bottom of a spring form pan .we are going to place it in our 500 degree oven bottom shelf .let it bake for 2 to 3 minutes .you want to keep an eye on it .you want it to get nice broil to it .you want the edges and the top to get a nice caramel color .so it will take about 2 to 3 minutes .you do n't want to leave it in too long or you will have melted ice cream .
the next thing we 're going to look at is organs .now the organs can be opened up when you make a new track. [CLS] [SEP]and you go into your track info and pick out a software instrument .there 's a couple organs right here a cathedral organ. [CLS] [SEP]a classic rock organ , jazz organ , pop organ. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to look at the smooth dance organ .now within the smooth dance organ you can look at the generator and actually change what ’ s going on here .there 's different keyboards and different and there 's tone wheel organ ,church organ you could actually start with the actual sound that they generate and change it .you could change it to different cathedral full circus organ things like that and actually change the beginning sound and then add effects to it .by adding compression automatic filter automate eq , echo and even reverb .you can change these with these faders and you could also take them off these check boxes .if you do n't want the eq to be on there. [CLS] [SEP]you just click the check box. [CLS] [SEP]and there 's no more eq .now once your all set with this what you want to do is you ether want to save it or just want to record your midi information and start you know like laying down on your tracks .
so now the whole piece has dried to leather hard , including the connected area .and again , leather hard is when you can rub your finger over it. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're not going to smear anything , but you can easily put a print with your fingernail .so now that it 's ready for that , i 'm going to take my ribbon tool .this is called a ribbon tool because it just peels off ribbons of clay , just like that .and what i want to do here is i want to get kind of a double bubble into this bottle .so i 'm going to make this base appear very rounded , and then i 'm going to kind of cut in .remember , i left a lot of clay with that flange , so i 've got a little room to work right there .and the base of your neck is generally going to be thick at the bottom , thicker than your top .so you have a little bit of room that you can trim in if you want to put a design .and you can pretty much do anything you want to do with this design here .so now i 've got it trimmed the way that i want it , and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to take my hard rib here .slide it against the bat , and just make sure i 've got a good undercut there .take my wire tool .cut the bottom .and pull this piece right off .now , if you just want a bottle , it 's done .but i 'm going to show you how to make a lid and how to add a handle if you want to have it more like a cruet .you could also pull a spout onto the tip of this bottle , if you wanted to make it a pitcher .and so now i 'll show you how to make the lid .
: now we have the pants of him and the two shoes almost in place .now , i have to have one of her shoes that we are going to put it in here .this is the leg who is supporting her that leg .we are going to mark that leg .and this is the movement of the dress .okay , with that leg .now , here we 're going to just to show the tip of the lady 's shoe that we are going to put in here .i 'm going to make a little hole here. [CLS] [SEP]then we are going to put it in there , but that 's to his foot , then we are going to clean this .now , we kinda have all the details we want .we 'll just smooth this out a little bit .then the position of the shoe , it made the position of the legs , and then they make the movement working .
we see the first name and last name with the address and the city and state , just like we chose it. [CLS] [SEP]and i made a sample of the greeting line .we see here , i put it above but it also formatted according to the selections we made with the first name and last name without a title .and , the program also went ahead and inserted the name of the city to each letter and , also. [CLS] [SEP], the price and our dollar sign is there , which we also inserted .so , now we can see , pretty much , what the letter looks like .we can go ahead and scroll through each letter in the letter that was created .in other words , each entry in our database we can go ahead and click down and scroll through each letter in case we want to make a correction .let 's say we find out this person does n't live in this particular city. [CLS] [SEP]and we want to change it .so we can scroll through , again the changes that we are making as we scroll through , nothing has been finalized .so , this is the point where we can edit all of this information .so , here we see we went back. [CLS] [SEP]and we can go into the letter to make corrections .see , i deleted the extra greeting field because we really do n't need it .we saw what it looked like and now we see that we are able to make those changes and we can , again , just go through each individual letter .we see that my added greeting line has gone away because i took it out. [CLS] [SEP]and i can , again , go ahead and scroll through .so nothing , at this point , has been finalized until we actually do the final merge and even at that point , we always have this file ready to make changes , even after we merge .
what you are looking for is something that it 's the appropriate length .you do n't want it come down pass your butt .you do n't want it to be really short. [CLS] [SEP]so you have a big gap between the end of your shorts and the beginning your jersey .you are also looking for a good solid fit both through arms and through your chest .so i am going to put this jersey on it is not going to fit exactly right because i am already wearing a work shirt .but it will give you a good idea of the type of fit you are looking for .which is fairly short. [CLS] [SEP]i don ?t have a lot of flap with my arms which is nice ?it 's real annoying to be riding down the trail or the road and to have a lot of wind flap .the other thing is i can tell this is the appropriate length because when i bend over , this is a full zip jersey .i do n't get a big bunch of zipper that sticks out , like you get when your jerseys are too long .this is a pretty good fit , what you want to go for .me at five foot ten and a hundred and fifty five pounds .i tend to wear a size small jersey .jerseys that are sized for americans which is interesting. [CLS] [SEP], i believe there is a size tag on it .oh i take it back. [CLS] [SEP]this is an extra small jersey .so it really depends what your , how your manufacture sizes things .you have an option of choosing between a full zip , a three quarter zip , or a quarter zip jersey .i always like to go for the full zip jersey just because you get more ventilation options .
when you 're shampooing your hair after you start at your locks , to make sure you shampoo very gently as to not disturb the lock process .in the beginning sometimes , you do n't want to wash your hair as much because as soon the hair starts actually matting , it 's easy for it to come down .so you want to make sure you kind of massage the scalp , but not do too much scrubbing and moving around ,cause then you 're going to mess up your lock extensions or your lock partings that you 've already started .so you want to make sure you concentrate a lot on the scalp and just let , and shampoo down .also , you can also rub in a circle depending on how you started them cause that will keep it and the motion , the clockwise motion that your hair is actually being twisted into .some people also starts locks that way .if you have very short hair , you can just roll it around in a circle until it beads up and locks , separates off by itself into locks .
next we are going to be talking about the edge of a snowboard .the edge is this metal piece that wraps around the board completely depending on the type of board .typically with the freestyle board it would have complete , wrap around , the free ride board would have a complete wrap around an all mountain board would have a complete wrap around. [CLS] [SEP]but as you got to a jib and rail board that is where it might differ .on a jib and rail board towards the center of the board there would either be an indentation on the rail or no rail at all on the entire board .the only other exception to the rule is the magne-traction sidewall which is a seven tooth serrated edge that looks something like this on either side of the board and what that is to do is it is literally supposed to cut into ice .if you were to have a sidewall like this it might just shave off a nice top layer of it but with a serrated edge you can cut right into it and do better turns .
call of duty 4 :modern warfare is a registered trademark of activision , a company in which i have no affiliation .okay .we really just need to get on capt . [CLS] [SEP]price now .this bridge is being blown up and you can fall off of this if you 're not stepping correctly .so , just be careful where you 're stepping and make sure there 's something under you .and this little spot provides great cover right here .this little spot right here , you can duck and have a good cover .there 's going to be a lot of enemy here --excuse me -- a lot of enemy here but just keep doing what you 've been doing this whole game with your l trigger. [CLS] [SEP]and you have a really good -- really good cover. [CLS] [SEP]so just be smart .you do n't want to get up above -- on this top ledge at all .you just want to stay right here .there 's no purpose in getting up there at all .and it sounds like our russian buddies are coming to help us out. [CLS] [SEP]so we know that we have help on the way .we just got ta make it .we just got ta last till they get here .
lighting designers need to understand a lot of different types of professionals .architecture being one .we need to be able to talk to architects since what we are doing is integral to architecture .we need to know the language of architecture .we also need to understand interior design .what different colors do , how some colors suck up light , some colors reflect light .we have to understand what the important parts of the interior designer is , what does the interior designer want to see .
chinese writing is very different from most other languages in the world .in the chinese writing system , chinese symbols represent each character which corresponds to a single spoken syllable .a majority of words in all modern varieties of chinese require two or more characters to write .many chinese characters were adopted according to their meaning by the japanese and korean languages to represent native words , disregarding pronunciation altogether .chinese characters are also considered to be the world 's longest continuously used writing system .
first of all the reason that horn players put there hands in the bell is that first it effects the sound of the horn , it gives the horn and part. [CLS] [SEP]it characteristic mellow quality and second of all you could control intonation with your hand .so first i 'm going to show you what your hand should look like the first thing i 'm going to do. [CLS] [SEP]is you want to put these four fingers together as tightly as possible .make sure that there is hardly any space between them. [CLS] [SEP]and then what you want to do is you want to scrunch your hand up like this .this is about the shape that you want , you are going to put your thumb just like so. [CLS] [SEP]and hopefully you could see that is up against the other fingers just as tight as they are with each other .the shape here is almost like the nike swoosh that is what you are going for. [CLS] [SEP]so once you have the proper position of your hand you are going put inside of the bell .what is important here is that the back of your fingers is out against the far side of the wall of the bell .like so .you do n't want to end so fine that your hand is blocking off the air. [CLS] [SEP]but as you could see you want it in pretty far you want to point when you could see my knuckles are just visible .if you keep your hand just like this , then you would be in a good position to change intonation and to ensure that you have the mellow tone that you want .
we 're going to use powder foundation on a foundation brush , which will give us a moderate to full coverage .help us kind of cover up some of these discolorations here .we 're just going to brush this all over her face .get her really nice and even .you can see as we 're applying it , it blends really nicely into her skin .it 's not leaving her any lines or demarcation along her jaw line and it looks really natural .it does n't necessarily look like she has a ton of makeup on , which is what you 're going for when you 're trying to achieve a perfect canvas .you do n't want to look like you have a full face of makeup on .you just want to look really nice , smooth , even , have a perfect color , and basically just enhance and even out your skin tone .that 's how you would want to apply your foundation .
in this series we 're going to talk about some things women can do to keep themselves safe while traveling or when they are out abroad .in dealing with assaults , there is a couple of versions ; there 's empty hand , someone just putting their hands on you grabbing you , maybe grabbing the hair .there 's weapon with a firearm. [CLS] [SEP]and there is with a knife .the weapons bring a whole different element of danger into it .it does n't take any skill to work a knife for example .the only thing with a knife is the person has to be close enough to reach you , that 's the only saving grace to have .it does n't take any skill , it never runs out of bullets , it 's dangerous from any angle .so the knife is a very dangerous weapon .now the gun is equally dangerous , but the advantage a gun has is that i do n't need to be within arms reach to do damage to you .so they 're both have their own unique defensive tactics to address them and we will be covering those at some level .one of the challenges weapons create is often times someone will use a weapon to get you , the female to come with them .this is extremely dangerous .if they want the person with them , that means they do n't feel comfortable where they are .they want to go someplace where they have more seclusion , more control of the environment .it 's very , very , very dangerous to ever leave with someone even with that weapon .in my opinion generally speaking , you are better off taking a chance to defending yourself in the first location then wait until they have absolute control over you in a second location .because then you will have very little chance as successfully defending yourself .if someone comes to your hotel room or approaches you in the street. [CLS] [SEP]and they say come with me. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm a police officer. [CLS] [SEP], you have every right to get there , have them show the badge of course and call the office to confirm that .
to get started we 're going to make some guidelines on a page , whether you 're using gridded or plain paper .now , for the pen that i 'm using , i 've established a four pen width , so , one , two , three , four .a four pen width height for the letters .so , whatever tool you 're using , you 're going to first determine what the height of these letters should be .and then you 're going to take a ruler and a pencil and make marks on the page that correspond to this interval .so , i know it 's four of these blocks , so i 'm going to measure four blocks , and four blocks , and four blocks .but , again , depending on what size pen you 're using you may have a different height , but it 's always going to be expressed in the same interval as the tool you 're writing with .so , if you 're writing with a big pen you 'll have more space .if you 're writing with a smaller pen , you 'll have smaller spaces , but they 'll be four pen widths .
okay , now we 're going to talk about how to lay out according to your custom diagram , how to lay it out on the ground .we 've got some string line , a string line set up here between a couple of stakes , and what we 're going to do is make a mark where the first post is going to be with a large x , and then use our tape measure to mark out the center of each hole , and mark each hole accordingly ; making sure to spray the line directly under your string ; keeping the line straight .
and you want to get rid of back fat .now back fat is not a very attractive fat .you can hide a lot of fat but you ca n't hide lets say for instance , bra fat and those of you. [CLS] [SEP]have it know what i 'm talking about .no matter what it just , every shirt you wear , it just shows it is not a very good look .and i do n't blame you for wanting to get rid of that .ok.how do you get rid of it , besides your diet .the good news i would say in most cases is you 've accumulated so much fat , that your body is not sure where to store it. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's putting it in those places that really are a lot harder to hide .the good news is it probably came on towards the end , it 's something you are noticing now , it 's the first thing that will come off with the right diet plan .so what exercise can you do .all of them .you have to exercise .you ca n't tell your body where to burn fat .how it works is usually first on last off .you start noticing here or here. [CLS] [SEP]first , that 's the last to go .just started to notice the back fat , first to go .good news .what can you do , start exercising .you got to get into a program , if you ca n't find a gym that you want to participate in , join an online program .there are lots of them .we have one .power1k.com .you can do that at home .so start exercising , stop ingesting so much saturated fat , read your labels and you are going to be surprised .back fat actually goes away pretty fast .i would say you pay attention. [CLS] [SEP]and you 'll see a huge difference in three weeks , twenty one days .and probably the biggest thing is ok. [CLS] [SEP]you find an online program. [CLS] [SEP]and you find a diet plan that make sense for you , do n't quit .see the problem is you are going to eventually have to deal with this .if you are already looking in the mirror and you are not satisfied , you are going to have to change something .but for the long term .i can not believe how many clients that i 've seen be successful and why they stick around .and then so many were just right on the cusp of making that change and for whatever reason. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm not sure exactly why , they quit .and then they just get even worse , they get more and more depressed and start to actually still gain fat .it 's not going to slow down , you have to change something. [CLS] [SEP]so when you get into a program , stick it out .stick it out , if you have to change programs , that 's fine .but do n't quit fitness .ok so put it in your life and you are going to see that back fat go away .good luck .
so choosing running shoes .for some people that is a very complicated process because there are so many types of running shoes that are out there , so many brands of running shoes that are out there. [CLS] [SEP]but some of the key components you want to look for in your running shoes are cushioning , stability and support .it also depends on what type of arch you have whether you have a flat foot or whether you have. [CLS] [SEP]a curved foot arch so that is very important .i would suggest that you actually go to a specialty running store and speak with someone who is an expert on helping you choose the right shoe .so this is your basic training shoe .these are really good because most training shoes have a really good deal of cushioning , stability , and support but some key things you want to remember when you are purchasing your training shoes is what type of arch do you have .do you have a flat foot arch ?do you have more of a curved foot arch ?i think getting those types of answers are really good when you are going to say a running specialty store as compared to maybe going to some other type of store where maybe the salesperson does n't really know much about training shoes .but most running specialty stores have runners who are well educated about helping you choose the right running shoe so those would be your basic trainer .if you want more of a lighter shoe for running say. [CLS] [SEP]5k races , 10 k , half marathon , even marathon distance , these are called racing flats and these are shoes that are a bit more lighter than your trainer shoes .if you feel like you are one of those swift runners or a fast runner. [CLS] [SEP]and you really want to have something that is light on race morning. [CLS] [SEP]then this would be your basic racing flat shoe .so the next type of shoe is called the track spike and this is a shoe that is used for runners who participate in track running events from 100 meters up to 10 ,000 meters on the track .now there are various types of spikes depending on what kind of event you are training for .so if you are training say for say a 100 meter or a 200 meter , or even a 400 meter track event there is a specific type of shoe that is geared towards those particular distances .if you are training for say 5 ,000 meters on the track or 10 ,000 meters on the track there is a specific type of shoe geared towards those distances .so the next type of running shoe is a trail running shoe and this is more of a heavier running shoe for those who enjoy running trails because on some trails it can be very rocky terrain , tree stubs , rocks and you need a shoe that is going to give you some extra grip as you are running some of the trails which may be flat trails , some of these trails are very hilly trails but the terrain can vary from really rocky to smooth but usually the trail shoes are a bit heavier .as you can see you have more rubber support around the shoe. [CLS] [SEP]and it gives you a better grip as you are running some of the rocky portions of the trail .
the next step that i 'll do is i 'll grab his goatee and pull it back so that it exposes the edges of the goatee that needs to be cleaned off .comb it through once .position it between your fingers , pull it back and anything that is coming outside of the fingers , clean .that 's how you clean that side up .bring it back .what i 'll do next is i 'm going to trim both sides of the goatee and how i 'll do. [CLS] [SEP]that is i 'll comb it both towards the center and the point of his chin .this will maintain the length and trim the perimeters all around the goatee .
now i 'm going to show you how to prepare your clay for the wheel .usually comes in 25lbs and if you buy it like this at your local service provider , it 's already de-aired .so you do n't have to worry about wedging the clay at all .basically , cut the amount that you want .whatever you 're making , a bowl , a vase .and make sure to always cover your clay back up so that it does n't dry out .then what you want to do since it 's already de-aired , is put it into a ball .just pound it , take your time and get it ready .this also helps flatten out the surface of the clay so you do n't have these edges. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's always going to throw you off when you 're trying to center .this happens a lot too , so you want to make sure you get all of that out .kind of just like slapping it around until you get the perfect shape .also , if you 're trying to make a set , you want to do this at the beginning and get all your pieces together and weigh them out .
the most common place to look is either backstage or actorsequity.org or actors access .backstage is a magazine. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's also a newspaper. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's also on the internet .so , you can join a subscription and access everything online .actorsequity.org , i like to use because it has all only the union auditions and all the broadway shows are union auditions .so , it kind of eliminates the non-union things , the tours , the tv things , the web , tv episodes .actors access is another great way to find auditions although if you 're really talking about broadway , actorsequity.org and backstage are really the best way to go .you 're going to find a breakdown which on actorsequity.org which is going to look like this. [CLS] [SEP]and this is a printout from the website .it says the name of the show , where to go , what to prepare , what they are looking for , the dates that the rehearsal start , everything like that .so , if you want to audition for broadway , go to actorsequity.org or backstage.com. [CLS] [SEP], maybe actors access too .
so your decorations and knickknacks in your bathroom are just like in other rooms , are things that you can definitely pack early , and that you probably wo n't be needing , per se , in the next two weeks .and again , i 'm going to leave most of my artwork up on the walls. [CLS] [SEP]just because it 's as good of a place as any to store it , it 's not in the way , it 's really easy to take down .an exception to that , that you might consider thinking about , is if you need to plug and paint over the holes that the nails have made in the wall , then you might consider taking down your pictures at an earlier time .the other thing in your bathroom that is a good thing to go ahead and take down about two weeks before that you can is your shower curtain .obviously you want to make sure you have some type of liner if you 're going to take down your shower curtain .but i 'm going to go ahead and take down this fabric curtain. [CLS] [SEP]and so that i can wash it and then fold it and put it in a box. [CLS] [SEP]and it will be ready to use at my new apartment .
now where going to talk about training for racquetball .all racquetball players , especially professional racquetball players are in tip top condition .i mean , let the results speak for themselves .right ?quickness is the key .most racquetball players train for their quickness .they ?re not trying to go like bodybuilders and lift a ton of weight , some very small reps.that 's not what matters .everybody is trying to get as fast as they can .when you watch these racquetball players diving all over the place , going with cat like quickness , it 's all because they 've trained with things like plyametrics and foot work and quickness drills .i like to do things like this .those kinds of things are what keep you fast out here .these kinds of training drills to get your foot work moving , to get your feet moving fast .that 's how you do it .jump rope is phenomenal .getting outside into the gym which is out here and doing more reps , higher reps.like twenty , twenty five , fifty .not as much weight as you possibly can , six. [CLS] [SEP], seven reps.that 's no good .that 's trying to get size on. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm not a big kid .all these racquetball players are n't big bulky guys .train for racquetball like you would for quickness , go. [CLS] [SEP]long reps because these matches can last two , three hours .if you 're not training , somebody else out there is and if you guys meet up , you 're going to lose .
now let 's dive right into line 6 , o.k . [CLS] [SEP]o.k. [CLS] [SEP], again our 8th note , 2 16ths ; if you see this symbol right here it 's a crescendo , o.k .it gets louder ; alright .now remember o.k. [CLS] [SEP], as we go throughout the line there are going to be some different dynamics ; not only that , see right here ; have another crescendo. [CLS] [SEP]and then it ends in piano ;o.k .so you got to look at the direction that the form and the line is going , alright .so follow along as we play ...o.k. [CLS] [SEP], so now take a look at my hand because this is a little bit of a different phrase we have n't really heard this , this is why i call it our ; another theme , our second theme ;o.k .so ... [CLS] [SEP]accent ...and if you see at the end i played it softly because it has a piano represented with a little p under the note to start with .
following a pattern gets easier the more practice you do .when you look at your pattern , the first thing it will tell you is the materials you will need to complete the project .in this particular case we need one skein of yarn in whatever color you wish , felt scraps for the eyes of the octopus which is what this pattern is , a size f or g crochet hook , and that is all we need .now most patterns will tell you the gage which is how much yarn takes up , for instance , an inch .so when you make your chain how ever many loops that is you will need to count and see if that goes with the gage and in this case it does n't matter because this is just something that can be any size .then as we said in the prior segment there are a number of abbreviations and you simply follow the pattern based on those abbreviations for instance , chain two , join with slip stitch into ring which means you are chaining two on the yarn and then taking a slip stitch in that first chain like we learned in making a circle. [CLS] [SEP]and then you continue following the pattern until you are finished and that is how simple it is to follow a pattern .
now i 'd like to just say a few words about ornamentation .and the ornamentation is really , kind of the basis of a lot of the american , native american style of playing .so that , for instance , when you 're hearing a phrase like , with the ornamentation it might be , and , would be .and the ornaments are very , very simple .you want to play a note , you come at it from the note above , or you come at it from the note below .and then there 's a little thing that they call the yip .and the yip can have the note above it , two notes above , three notes .so the yip can have all kings of different characteristics , and it can be different volumes , or .now , the trills , with the yip on the end .so , the basic characteristic of the native american style is those little ornamentations , and gradually , you 'll learn to do the ornamentations , which are really just , again , variations on the scale .
this cocktail is called buttafuoco .go ahead and put your ice in your glass , to start out with .we 're going to do two ounces of tequila , there we go , one , two .now , we 're going to do a half an ounce of galliano .galliano is a very distinctive bottle , you will know it when you see it .now we 're going to do a half an ounce of cherry liqueur , half an ounce of cherry liqueur and half an ounce of fresh squeezed or fresh squeezed and bottled , lemon juice , in that goes .now , we 're going to fill the rest with our club soda .because club soda is so fizzy , you just want to sort of toss this back and forth. [CLS] [SEP]so it does n't explode everywhere .this is what your buttafuoco is going to look like .last but not least , we are going to garnish your buttafuoco with a marashino cherry and a cocktail straw .you are good to go , cheers .
here 's how it works .we 're going to play a doum on the one , followed by ka , tek , ka on the two , three , and four .doum , ka , tek , ka ; doum , ka , tek , ka ; doum , ka , tek , ka ; doum , ka , tek , ka ; doum , ka , tek , ka ; doum , ka , tek , ka ; doum , ka , tek , ka ; doum , ka , tek , ka .the second variation on that is the same pattern , but we 're going to alternate doum , on the first repetition and slap in its place on the second .here 's how that works : doum , ka , tek , ka ; slap , ka , tek , ka ; doum , ka , tek , ka ;slap , ka , tek , ka ; doum , ka , tek , ka ; slap , ka , tek , ka .and with practice , you can get it a little bit faster .
i 'm talking about the process for moving into a new space and how to set up that space efficiently and functionally and easily .right now we 're in the kitchen and talking about how to organize our kitchen and specifically we 're talking about where is a place that make sense to put your flatware that you 're using every day .so my flatware. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm putting in this drawer right here .and i chose this drawer for a couple of reasons .one that it is near my dishes and so that made sense to me .another reason is because it 's also relatively near to the dishwasher. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'll probably be standing at the sink when i 'm loading and unloading the dishwasher. [CLS] [SEP]and so it 'll be easy for me to stand there , grab the silverware , the flatware , and put it in here .and that 's something that i 'll be washing on a daily basis as well .and another reason that was kind of decided for me is that these are really the only two drawers that i have in the kitchen , so my other options were maybe to keep them out on the counter or to put them in this drawer and for reasons that i just explained , i chose this drawer .so within this drawer i have the silverware in this little organizer which you can get even just at a grocery store or any kind of organizational store .and i have put my forks , spoons and knives here .some , if you have a bigger drawer then you can separate your soup spoons from your regular spoons and your salad forks from your dinner forks. [CLS] [SEP]but i 've just grouped them all because of the size of my drawer .that is something that you 'll want to take into account when you go and get an organizer. [CLS] [SEP]is you want to make sure to measure your drawer because they make these in a lot of different sizes .i also have my knives in here that i use very often and pretty much every time i prepare a meal. [CLS] [SEP]and so i have those in here as something i 'm using every day and keeping them in this organizer keeps me from having to rummage around and cut myself. [CLS] [SEP]and then i also have my chopsticks which i just sometimes like to use for the challenge .but i use those relatively often as well .so i have put them in there in their own space in this drawer .so those are some things that you might want to think about when you 're picking a place for your flatware. [CLS] [SEP]is how often you use it , when you use it , the kinds of things that you 're using along with your flatware will inform where you store it .
now we are going to talk about how to lose fat on your legs .now my recommendations for losing fat on your legs , are fairly simple .just doing the combination of resistance training , and cardiovascular training .so with resistance training you are building muscle .a lot of the misconception is people think that they are going to get really big when they are doing resistance training .here is a fact , resistance training helps build muscle which takes away from fat .cardiovascular training helps burn fat. [CLS] [SEP]but you are not building muscle .so you are not going to see any tone .so in order to get the tone you want to do two in conjunction with each other .so for instance resistance training will build the muscle and the only reason why you seem like you are getting bulky is because you have n't lost the fat on top of the muscle .then the cardiovascular end you 'll lose the fat from on top of the muscle .so when you combine the two together you become a perfectly toned person with great legs .the best way is to do a mixture of resistance training and cardiovascular training .believe it or not the combination of the two , makes sure that you get the effective and most positive look or outcome that you want .so resistance training is typically based upon lifting weights and cardiovascular. [CLS] [SEP]is either running , swimming ,anything that really gets your aerobic or your heart rate up .
hi , i 'm joe cuenco with family resources .we 're talking today about how to improve our marriage relationships , specifically , how do we pamper our wife ?this may be the most important thing that we do in our marriage .so listen carefully as we talk about how do we pamper our wife .this is really going to be specific to your wife 's personality .each woman has things that are very important to her , and there are things that she does n't like as well .so it 's very important that we pay attention to these things .but before we pay attention to them , we first have to understand and know what they are .have a dialog with your wife .ask her what it is that makes her feel special .ask her what it is that makes her feel like the most important person in the world .you need to dote on your wife , you need to pamper her .do these things to make her feel special .of course , the foundation fundamentals have to be there .love , trust , respect , friendship , communication .those are huge , but building upon those are ways that you can actually make your wife feel very special .buying here chocolates , buying her flowers .when was the last time you rubbed her back , or gave her a foot massage .or actually , perhaps , rubbed her back in the jacuzzi , doing something to really make her feel special .how are you with her ...her family members ?you know , this is important to mention , being able to get along with the family , her mother .you want to eliminate those things as far as any ...any stress in the relationship .and also , make sure that she has the physical attention that she needs .are you holding her hand ?are you ... [CLS] [SEP].are. [CLS] [SEP]you putting you arm around her ?are you opening up the door for her when you go out on dates ?and also on the ... [CLS] [SEP]one the intimacy side , are you giving her more than you expect ?and is she getting less than you want to give perhaps ?so , it needs to have a happy medium .so , have a dialog there .be prepared to give , and ultimately you 'll receive .doctor john gray of the venus and mars book series , has a lot of good advice here .there 's other things that you can do .attend workshops .but it may be as simple as sitting down and watching tv with her , a tv program .and i would suggest doing that , except do n't watch desperate housewives .so , make sure that you pay attention to your wife , make her feel special .and that 's how you pamper your wife .i 'm joe cuenco , with family resources , relationships for life .
sketchbook , a sketchbook is important .i carry it with me sometimes , and sometimes i do n't .but i have this special pouch that a native american made for me .and my sketchbook looks like this ,of course inside you know you can , i have the cover for it , and. [CLS] [SEP]then you can just every time you do a sketch or when it 's full then you just replace the book .i wanted to show you the sketch of the heart and soul piece that i did on the beach that one day , and also i wanted to show the sketch of a piece called angel of compassion .because i lived in new york city , and because i 've been to the world trade center ,when that tragedy happened i did this brief sketch .and i created a ten foot piece of sculpture .the inspiration came to me very quickly , and i would just like to show you that piece .
now a good way to check your own individual stick height or even as a drumlin is to look into a mirror .so instead of getting into the habit of looking down all the time at your bead which you are not going to want to do is to look straight forward. [CLS] [SEP]and you can really see in the mirror where you are playing .like if i want to play 3 inches i realize that is a little high by looking in the mirror. [CLS] [SEP]and i can take it down a little bit .now if you got a large enough mirror this one is , if you put this on horizontally you can see all the sticks for may 3 or 4 guys and you can really match your heights not only to your self but to the other players .but for your sticks you are also going to want to make sure that from stick to stick that your height is consistent you want to make sure that is i was playing 16 notes that may left stick. [CLS] [SEP]is n't higher then my right when i 'm trying to play 1 dynamic .
what i 'm going to talk about is how to treat the sting of the common wasp .the common wasp sting will be characteristic of a great deal of pain , possibly burning and localized redness and swelling to the site area .the site area may have a stinger in it that needs to be removed , by using the backside of a butter knife or credit card to scrape away the stinger from the skin .do not attempt to grab the stinger with a pair of tweezers as this may further envenomate your person or another person that has a stinger in place .check for the stinger relatively quickly , as swelling may occur rapidly and hide a stinger that may still be in place .once the stinger is removed , wash the area with soap and water and possibly use something like rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide to disinfect the area .you can then apply a paste made of backing soda and water to the sting area or even meat tenderizer to help with the healing process and the pain and discomfort .applying ice in ten to fifteen to twenty minute intervals on and off , will also help reduce swelling .benadryl , or some type of anti histamine cream can also be applied to help reduce pain and swelling .i 'm captain joe bruni , stay safe and we 'll see you next time .
part two of what we are doing today with our shrimp and creamy grits is we are going to go ahead and start our sauce .so i have taken a third of a cup of smithville ham/bacon. [CLS] [SEP]we are going to add these to our skillet lightly let it brown .so this is part one we are to make sure we have a low heat. [CLS] [SEP]as well always check that .and we do n't want to actually crisp these we just want to mildly get them brown which we have done right there. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to our next step which is adding the heavy cream .that we are going to be folding into this .we have. [CLS] [SEP]right here this is actually store bought just table cream you can use half and half , you can even go with a low fat cream as well .we are just going to keep this at a light stir , we are going to add our worcestershire sauce as well to give it a little flavor .and i just generally do five or six squirts you can definitely eye ball. [CLS] [SEP]this. [CLS] [SEP]like i said wahtever works for you .if you are very conscious of what you are adding you can definitely weight this out. [CLS] [SEP]i would say it is a third of a teaspoon and once again your are just going for a little bit of flavor which this is going to add to it and be careful to taste as you go along the way .what we want to do with this is we want to let this reduce down. [CLS] [SEP]so it actually becomes a sauce .this is going to actually cook for probably about four to five minutes .we do n't want our sauce to thicken up , we just actually just want it to form. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to add a pinch of salt which we have right here .you can hear our grits bubbling over there .a pinch of salt and we are going to go into our next step which is adding our asparagus tips. [CLS] [SEP]our roasted corn and our half cut roasted tomatoes .
indoor rock climbing gym in wilmington , north carolina .today we 're going to discuss rock climbing gear .one of the most important pieces of gear that you would want to own when you start to rock climb is your harness .your harness is going to be your life line to hold you up .so whether you 're climbing in an indoor gym or outside , your harness is very important to have and to be fitted correctly .the harness that we use is made from misty , misty mountain in north carolina .great harnesses , really strong , got good padding on it , all the way around so if you 're in it all day it 's comfortable .there are a lot of different brands of harnesses and different makes , depending on the type of climbing you 're doing .this is a , this is a harness for trad climbing .it has a lot of gear loops , a very wide back band , and lots of padding , so it 's going to be extremely comfortable .this , along with every other piece of gear that you 're going to want to use , take proper instruction to learn correctly how to put it on and use it .it has specific tie in points , and specific belay loop .again , this is rock climbing gear .
we 've already done our back .we 've already done our biceps .now we need to work on the back of the arm , and that 's the tricep .first exercise we 're going to do is a basic pull down or push down bar .so what we 're going to do right here. [CLS] [SEP]take the bar about shoulder length apart .you can either go a little bit in or a little bit out .if you go out , you might get your back involved .so let 's just go shoulder width apart .get a nice bend at the knees and hips , back straight .and then all you 're going to do is do a push , push straight down and control up .straight down and control up .straight down and control up .you want to keep tension at all times .you do n't want to go down to the bottom .always keep a little tension on there .straight down and up .you want to keep the elbow as stationary as possible because again we 're trying to work the tricep .you do n't want to get the back involved by doing this motion .you want to keep it a nice isolated movement .and again that 's going to work the tricep area .
hi welcome back. [CLS] [SEP]my name is megan moe. [CLS] [SEP]and today i 'm teaching you some tips , giving you some suggestions and some pointers on how you can keep yourself clean safe and germ free on your next visit to the gym .now one area of the gym that you need to be wary of is the fitness accessories if you choose to use them .now since you are going to be touching many of these with your bare hands such as this , a pilates ring .it does have handles so you are going to be making direct contact with it , you want to be sure that when you do touch it , that it 's either been sanitized before hand or if you are more comfortable or if you are going to be using more then one piece of equipment , it might be more convenient for you to wear a pair of gloves .just some cheap disposal gloves such as these , you just put them on before you touch anything. [CLS] [SEP]and it creates a barrier between your skin and the article .and of course you can always sanitize it too , to be extra sure .and the same thing goes if you want to use something like the stability band , like this one .just go ahead and put a glove on or you can sanitize the handle before you use it , and if you do that , please make sure to sanitize it afterwards again .and just like that you can pull it up. [CLS] [SEP]and it creates a barrier between your skin and the handle. [CLS] [SEP]and it protects you from any bacteria that might be there .and if you do choose to sanitize it , something that you are going to want to do is take your ethanol and again this has to sit for about a minute .so you are just going to spray this right on here and let that sit on anywhere that your hand is going to touch it .and you can just set this aside and wait for that one for a minute or two and the same for any stability band or if it 's more convenient you can use an anti bacterial wipe .it does n't take quite as long and it might be a little bit less messy because you are not going to get any over spray. [CLS] [SEP]and you can just throw it away when you are done .so these are also a very good option .and that goes for any gym accessories. [CLS] [SEP], you just want to let it sit with ethanol and that 's about all you need to take care of with those .so i 'll give you some more tips when we come back .
the batter is mixing up .we 're waiting for the batter to get all melted and cooled down .you can use the time to clean up your mess , which eliminates you doing it later .it 's not really a messy item to do , but it does create a mess .we can put our dishes away , and now utensils .that way we can use the time wisely .that way we do n't waste time doing it .also , we 're going to need to strain it after everything is done .we need to strain the batter and put it in a container .use a simple screen like that .that way you do n't get no clumps in your crepe batter .the crepe batter has to flow on the grill and it comes out smooth .if it has those clumps inside of it , it will not do as good folding the job with it .it 'll look like little lumps on it .
with the wheel going at a moderate speed we can finish the neck of the bottle and applying a little bit of water to the neck and wetting our hands .putting our left hand on the inside , our right finger tracing that curve and again just putting it a little bit more , we can indent the neck , right index finger just kind of tracing that curve , keeping that curve , nice round curve , and then we can begin pulling up the neck of the bottle .the last step is to use our sponge on a stick removing any excess water from the forming operation to prevent any cracking in the future .

cindy mastry :faith and i have been working on the ardha chandrasana , half moon pose , by coming into distant transitions using a block and using the wall .now , we 're ready to try this without the wall and using faith 's own balance .so we 're still going to have her use the block .good .so she 's going to step her feet wide and turn her toes out .good .and she 's going to reach her arm out and just bring it up about --the block up about a foot above her foot and then out to the side , maybe six inches .it 's more difficult the more. [CLS] [SEP][ sounds like ] in line you have .so if you 're just trying this for the first time , you 're going to bring the block over to the outside of the pinkie toe about six inches .good .she 's going to inhale and lengthen her arm up as she extends her foot back .good .flexing through her foot .good .she 's going to lengthen out through the crown of the head , rotating through her spine , massaging her internal organs , getting a good engagement of the thigh , lengthening through her quad and flexing through her foot .now , she has to imagine that that wall is still there behind her foot because this is really something that helps her balance .she has to engage her core and think about bringing all her energy into her core and then sending it out through all the different parts of her body .she 's pressing down into the block and lengthening up through her fingertips .and gradually , she will be able to come down lower and lower till , eventually , her hand rest on the floor .
in this video , we 'll be adding some chord tones to our walking bass line .so on beat two of every bar , you 're going to play the third of the chord .so , for f7 , that 'll be a , for b-flat 7. [CLS] [SEP], that 'll be d and so on .watch out for g-minor , it 's actually a minor third , all the rest are minor thirds though .we 're going to continue playing the tension resolution with a half step above .so it 'll be , root third ,root half step , and so on .got the metronome on two and four .one , two , three , four .
i 'm going to show you how to do a nice quad stretch in modern dance .so , first of all i 'm going to make sure that my feet are rooted in the ground .i 'm going to imagine that i have little roots all along my foot , and that 's it 's pushing my feet into the ground .then i 'm going to bend my standing leg -- both legs actually --but i 'm going to pick one leg up. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to reach for it with my hand , and i 'm going to pull it behind my body .so what i 'm doing here -- i 'll show you from the side --i 'm pulling my heel to my sits bone .so from the side you 'll see .i 'm pulling my heel straight back to my sits bone .and i 'm just pulling on it , pulling on it , so that i can feel a little stretch in my quad .if i want i can use both of my hands .if i feel like i want to go even deeper , i might raise my hand up , and i 'm going to reach up and out with my hands and up and out with my foot at the same time .so i 'm pushing my foot into my hand .and that feels like a nice , intense stretch of my quad .now , if that 's too much , if this is enough of a stretch. [CLS] [SEP]and i feel like i do n't have enough balance here. [CLS] [SEP], i might hold onto a chair or hold onto the wall , and that 's fine .we really want to just continually deepen our stretch , but work within our body 's limitations , so you need to really listen to your body and see what your body wants to do here .so , that 's a great way to stretch out your quads , and actually also to open up your hips in modern dance .
so from here , kind of wiring it down to the last bit .so we 've already started .we have a nice white pallet right there .to me this is like an artist 's dream because you have just a pleather of different colors that are about to transform into some food artist work .so , that right there.. [CLS] [SEP]next we 're going to go with , look how simple these ingredients are .we have our dates , our candied walnuts that we toasted up in a little bit of brown sugar , a little bit of butter as well , and some cayenne pepper .we have our grape tomatoes , or if you want to say pearl tomatoes .we have our gorgonzola , shaved badelia , and last but not least our balsamic vinaigrette .so , and we 're going to finally hit it off with some fresh crustinies , one of my favorites .ah , croutons are good , crustines are great , so .and a little bit of fruit on there , we have our bosc pears .we also have some tangerine segments that we 've scored and split up , courtesy of you .so here 's what we do .we 're going to go with three pears or flans on that end .we 're going to go with three on that end .orange segments up in there .now if you notice you see how our color is starting to build up .we went from the green to the orange , now to the pears .pop some cherry tomatoes in there , one , one , always want to stretch our profile , and , ah , think that 's good .we 're going to take some of our shaved badelia onions , kind of pop those on there. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm a huge onion , sauteed ,fried , you name it. [CLS] [SEP]i claim it .a little bit of these candied dates , we 're going to break apart because these get super sticky and these date back to ancient times .so , very healthy , a lot of history behind them as well .so , pay attention .and last we 'll go with our simple presentation to hit this salad off .watch the color pile up .
costa waez :and now we 're going to show you how to prepare the hookah to be smoked .now , first of all , we take the head , which has some holes to go through inside .we fill it up with the tobacco. [CLS] [SEP]and then we put the aluminum foil on the top .we squeeze it and it comes this way sealed .we place it on the top , as we said before .then we take a toothpick , simple toothpick , and we make small little holes so the smoke will go through .and then we take one charcoal , we hold it with a tong , we light it. [CLS] [SEP], we wait until it 's ready , and then we place it on the top of that aluminum foil .and we wait about two or three seconds. [CLS] [SEP]and then we smoke it. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's ready to go and enjoy it .
if it is cooked .that looks nice and toasty .so anyway we have this is what our bill of fair is tonight is roasted corn and veggie kabob over a open pit fire .it is pretty simple and pretty effective .so i 'm going to go ahead and say grace. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to sit down and eat some veggie kabob that we cooked over a open pit fire .with some good friends , good food , it is good times and thank you for joining us on expert village and thank you .oh that is hot .oh that is really good !i want to try a little piece of zucchini here. [CLS] [SEP]and we use no kind of lighter fluid here anywhere in this operation .thank you and bon appetite .
ok , let 's go for what we need for our mac and cheese to start : some pasta , some dried pasta shells .honestly , whatever you want to use .if you really like that fussily , the corkscrew pasta , or if you like the smaller shells , hey. [CLS] [SEP]whatever makes your frog jump , the way my dad says .i like the large macaroni shells .i like the big ones ; to me they 're just heartier and just feels. [CLS] [SEP]more like it 's homemade .some pasta shells , of course we nee cheese , that 's our main event .you can use whatever kind of cheese you want ; i love to mix the cheeses though .the more different kinds the better .i have a cheese blend actually .this is already shredded i bought in the grocery store .it has mozzarella , monterey jack , and cheddar all in it , so that 's just going to give a great combination of flavors .also , i have a little bit of left over parmesan , grated parmesan , that i 'm going to put a little bit in there with the cheese blend , also a little bit on top for that brown crusty thing on top .so , more cheeses the better .i have the blend and the parmesan .we do need a little bit of flour ; we need a little bit of milk .we need some butter , of course , have i made anything at the baker 's corner without butter yet ?it 's a staple ; i 'm sorry .and we need a couple of spices .we 're going to use a little bit of worcestershire , actually .we just using a very small amount of this , kind of like a secret weapon , you wo n't really taste it , but it 's going to give it a , mmm , nice kick to it .we using some salt and pepper and some ground dry mustard .fantastic and very necessary , dry mustard .ok , let 's get started putting all this stuff together .
well if you go outside and your little guy is not moving around the pool .one thing that you want to make sure of is that it did n't try to eat something to big .now alright .it 's got a hole for it here in the bottom and. [CLS] [SEP]only a certain amount of things can go through it and if it 's too big and a lot of times it will get stuck and not go through it .weather it be a large piece of bark .maybe a pebble that 's too ambitious for it or a leaf or a twig. [CLS] [SEP]that 's just to big .one of the ways to clear. [CLS] [SEP]it is this one. [CLS] [SEP]right here is actually a little screw .i am going to use my hand drill here .to back it out the little guy comes right out here and there is also two more that you can take out there .alright .of course a hand held one is just as good .you will remove this bottom plate here which brings the bottom down a little bit closer to get down to vinyl to get all the debris .and here is a little throat that comes out here .and now all you have to do is either , yea blow or push the debris out .make sure it 's nice and clear .make sure there is nothing else in there and then just go reversing the process and put it back into place .
and i 'm here to show you how to make raspberry cream to go over a dish of raspberries .so i 'm going to take about a cup and a half , or so , of some cool whip .i 'm going to add two teaspoons of the raspberry wild tree cheesecake blend .now you can do this with a mixer , but i just thought of doing it by hand to show you how really easy this is .you just blend that cheesecake blend in with this cool whip .and you 've got a raspberry taste to die for .of course i would n't know that anymore , at the early age i developed an allergy to raspberries .so i wo n't be sampling these .but then add a dab on that one .another dab on this one .and you can serve this to your guest using fat free cool whip and make it a healthy dessert .
to get started , let 's get some ink going through our pens and do a little warming up with fitting the letters , or the marks in between the guidelines .so a good warm up is just to make a series of parallel lines .so i 'm making three vertical lines , and then i 'm going to make three horizontal lines .and three vertical lines , and three horizontal lines .in this exercise , we 're paying attention to the place where the ink is going , and the way the lines fit within the guidelines , and also trying to achieve a pattern of very similar marks .so we 're holding the pen at the same angle .we 're making the marks. [CLS] [SEP]so they 're all just about the same .and again it sometimes looks easier than it actually is to do in practice .
hi , we 're going to be using sea shells today to make this great little mail organizer .it 's perfect for just setting on your desk .so , what we 're going to need is piece of craft wood you can get from a local shop that sells craft supplies .you are going to need acrylic paint in various colors .you 're going to need some sea shells. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to want two scout shells like this about the same size .then you 're just going to want some other various shells for decoration .we 're going to need ribbon which we have here , a paper plate for our paint pallet. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to need two brushes .you 're going to need a small artist brush. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 're also going to need a larger brush and the last thing we 're going to need to put this look together. [CLS] [SEP]is hot glue gun and some epoxy glue. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 're all set to get started on your sea shell organizer .and the final touch i recommend getting is you can either get some beach sand. [CLS] [SEP]cause we 're going for a beachy theme or you can get these great beads .there in the sand colors and we 're going to use those with our epoxy glue and glue them down and make them look like it 's a little beach for the shell organizer. [CLS] [SEP]just a nice touch you can add .
i 'm the owner of a local fish store in lindon , utah .the best way to reduce or even eliminate nitrates in a saltwater fish tank is through consistent water changes .nitrates are a natural build up and the end process of the nitrification cycle .the way these build up is usually commonly from fish food , fish waste or other organic material that is decomposing in the tank .make sure that you have enough live rock or other biological filtration to be able to do this efficiently .once again if you do receive a high concentration of nitrates the best thing to do is water change .there are also a few products out there that will also effectively reduce your nitrates in your system .however , these are just a temporary fix and do not provide a long term correction to your problems .by doing constant water changes you are actually taking out a high concentration of nitrate water and reducing the overall concentration of nitrates in your tank by replacing it with 0 amount of nitrates in your new clean , fresh , unpolluted saltwater .
now next to budget , time line is probably going to be the most important aspect of your recording project .now the reason for this is that things tend to take a lot longer than you think they will when you 're recording an album .now you need to have some flexibility and be generous with the amount of time that you 're going to give this project .for example , in the writing stages , if you already have the songs written , it might be easier to say ,okay here are the songs we 're going to put on the album .if you have n't written any songs yet , you need to give yourself some time to write those tunes .only you will know how quickly you produce music .so say you average a song a week. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to record an album that has twelve songs on it. [CLS] [SEP], you 've got to give yourself twelve weeks to write this album , because if you give yourself less than that , you might end up writing bad material by writing it too quickly .so in that instance , you 're already three months down the line before you enter the studio .then you want to look at aspects how long it will take in the recording studio .you might budget a day a song , or if your budget is small , you might try to get two or three songs done in a day .and mastering as well .you might be able to get three songs in a day during mastering , you might spend more time on that .but again , look at your budget and you can make that assessment .of course the more time you spend on it , the better this disc will be .
another possible opening style that you can work with and do something fabulous out of would be a style with a center front ring .what that means is this right here. [CLS] [SEP], we 'll say she 's a martian. [CLS] [SEP]so we 'll see her green skin. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll see her green skin .green is either she is feeling very queasy. [CLS] [SEP]or she is not of this world .so there , this is skin , this is skin .what you have is an actual little metal ring that 's sewed into the fabric , hence there is stitch lines in a circle right there .you are taking the fabric and you are wrapping it around the metal ring and sewing it together , which creates all the bunching and all the folds that i 've drawn coming out , shooting out from the center .you have to wrap , you pull it tight , wrap it around and that 's going to create the bunching. [CLS] [SEP]and you need to indicate that by lines somehow .it looks like a sunshine , it 's not the sun , but that 's how you do that .
when they punch , just do a straight punch for now .the idea is to use a block and use the palm to guide the arm , wherever you want it .the cool thing about the outside palm block is , that turns into a grab , very quickly .see , this way you can pull and strike .another interesting use for the palm block is , most people do n't usually punch straight on .mostly skilled fighters know how to punch straight on .a lot of people use this big overhead right technique .yeah , just like that .a lot of people do martial arts who want to know how to defend against the random technique like that .the outside palm block is a very easy way to block against the technique .so do want it slow ?see , just like that .and do a one little faster .see , ooh !just like that .the cool thing again , this technique turns into a grab , very quickly .see here .and then , you can use it to do your throws .outside palm block is a very useful technique when practiced properly .you want to make sure you move from the right to the left or from the left to the right .facing the palm to the outside of the body .that 's how you perform the outside palm block in the praying mantis style .
tadasana the mountain pose is the basic foundation for all of our other standing pose .you can think of it as like the one source out of which all these diversity comes .and so we always want to start in tadasana , as a way to remember the source , even to remember our breath and why we do this practice .this helps us come back to the center. [CLS] [SEP]then we 'll take that grounded center into every pose that we do .so you start with your feet hip width apart .and with your feet hip width apart , you want to line up your second toes. [CLS] [SEP]so they 're parallel to each other .so you notice your second toes , you want them to be parallel to each other and even to the outer edges of your mats .then also , from your second toe , there 's a line that goes straight to the center of the ankle and even the center of the heel .so keep all those line parallel to each other .that one sure a super stable foundation .then from the feet , you move up the legs , the center of the knees lines up with the center of the ankle , the center of the hips .as you move up through the legs , feel your waistline get longer , allow your shoulders to draw back .as your shoulders drawback , you can open the palms a little bit , let the shoulder blades move into the heart and just feel , pause and feeling your breath .feel the steadiness in your legs .feel the way that the earth is really beneath your feet , stable and supportive .and then make your legs more like the earth , so they feel more like grounded , more rooted , more connected .
and this is a funny little balance you can do .we have one hand forward , one hand back. [CLS] [SEP], i can only hold it. [CLS] [SEP]so long i think before one falls backwards , and then you can come forward and lay it down , release the hips down , and you can even take it into a backward bend , if you like , hips forward , and then it feels really good right about that time , just let the legs lengthen out .you want to let the legs lengthen out , give those joints a little tlc down there .i really feel what i 've been try to do this whole session , elongation of the legs .they just feel like a foot longer than they did last time .downward dog .take this one slowly , well you 'll intuitively do that anyways because those knees and ankles are probably kind of creaky from all that lotusing .it 's a wonderful recovery pose , the lower legs .
the next area that we 're going to talk about is trying to keep your shoulders above your knees .the basic stance in boxing , as chad will demonstrate here , is to actually have your heels shoulder width apart .and for some people that of course is going to vary .chad has got about an eighteen inch shoulder width , so his heels should be about eighteen inches apart and. [CLS] [SEP]twenty-four inches between there somewhere .now , as he 's advancing , he wants to keep his shoulder just above the knee .that 's the proper way of doing it .and vice versa .going backwards , we do n't want to lean too far back .we want to still keep the shoulder above the knee .now showing the wrong way is if he moves his shoulder past his knee , he 's -- you can see ,he 's way outstretched , okay , and that puts that back foot up off the ground .what that 's going to do is it 's going to help him to topple over , possibly .so , he wants to make sure that the heel goes with the shoulder .keep the shoulder above the knees , basically .and your heel is going to be below your knee .so once you 've got your shoulder above your knee , then you should be fine .also going backwards , you can see the difference .if his shoulder is passed his knee in the back , he 's too far back , and that 's also a dangerous situation .if we 're moving to the left and right , we should also try to keep that shoulder above the knee at all times , so that we 're not leaning too far off to one side .once you start leaning too far forward , too far back , or too far to one side , you 're more susceptible to getting knocked over when you do get punched .shoulders above knees .thank you .
here 's an independent exercise that you can try .okay , here 's another independent exercise with the shuffle .now , i call this a shuffle also , we call this a hand shuffle .
i 'm going to talk about the uses of a , of a band saw .this type of band saw , this is a vertical band saw .but there 's also a horizontal band saws too , which you can use .and you can use those to cut pipe .you can throw the pipe on there. [CLS] [SEP]and it 'll cut straight down .and the good thing is it 'll cut super square cuts .and at very clean cuts with that .this type , you can cut like flat sheets of metal .cut sheet metal .you can almost , if the blade 's small enough , you can actually sort of curve .you can cut plywood .you can , anything wood , metal .you can run it right through .you can cut it at any angle you want .the table , it actually tilts and you can , you can cut a lot of stuff with it .just depends how big it is .and if you have a vertical or horizontal or you can have both .so the uses on this is a , is a very big , big selection .you can do a lot with a , with a band saw .
theres kimchi from whole cucumbers which is a salting process , there 's kimchi from leaks which is a very delicious salty process. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's spiced with the average spices that were going to go over later today .for our purposes i 'm going to make a kimchi that 's quick to make because this is in hours and hours and hours long process and sometimes a month long process .once kimchi is pickled it 's then fermented which gives it its interesting flavoring giving it 's nutritional properties .so we 're going to make a kimchi today called hoy kimchi. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's made with cucumbers. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's pickled with soy sauce and not salt .
so little gold angels all around. [CLS] [SEP]and then you just place it on the top of your christmas tree just like that .and then you have a gold angel .it 's very simple to make , your child can help you and it 's great fun .you can watch your christmas tree with your homemade angel .children will be very proud of their work .of course you can decorate it if you wanted .you can use other colors with it and you can make any shape that you wish .
so , in craps , you know , you 're , you 're doing. [CLS] [SEP], you 're do your coming out roll .you throw the dice , you try to establish the point , which is any value between four and ten , excluding seven .and then , once you 've established the point , you 're trying to hit it again .there are a number of ways to miss it .if you , let 's say your point is eight , now , anything else you get , you 're technically missing it .but , there 's no harm. [CLS] [SEP], there 's no foul , if you get a two , a three , four , a five or a six , a nine or ten , eleven , or twelve .no harm , no foul in the home version of craps .if you get an eight , you 've hit your point .you get a seven , you 've missed your point , and there is harm in a foul , because it ends your turn .so , there you go .so , remember , you 're in good shape if you get anything but a seven .so , let 's say my point is eight. [CLS] [SEP], there 's nine , no harm , no foul .six , no harm ,no foul .eight , i hit my point , great .but , let 's say i got a seven , than that is missing the point .
hi , we 're going to present ourself in tadasana , mountain pose .this pose begins in the soles of your feet .so we 're going to take a look down at the soles of your feet , and see that they are parallel with each other , so they 're not turning out , turning in , balling out , balling in .we want to stay right here , lifting all ten toes , and see if we ca n't ground the soles of your feet ; the whole ball of your foot , as equal as the heel , and then you 'll be able to drizzle all ten toes , melting into the earth .from the soles of your feet , we 're going to look at the ankles ; lifting the ankles , traveling up to the knees ; checking that the ankles are directly below the knees ; traveling up ; that the knees are directly below your hips .continue to travel up , checking that the hips are directly in line with your shoulders .then we want to create space in your neck , lifting from the crown of your head .and then we 're going to drop your shoulders ; relaxing .we 're going to lift the sternum up toward your chin ; opening the heart .begin to strengthen your legs , so that this is a powerful pose .feel the balance equally from right side to left side .feel the strength in your legs , as you continue to lift and lengthen your spine .so if we take a look at this from the side view , you 're going to have a straight line from the shoulder to the hip to the ankle , pausing to just enjoy the pose and re-evaluate .
the next kick boxing technique we 're going to focus on is called our spin side kick .a spin side kick , i 'm going to demonstrate it for you at normal speed. [CLS] [SEP]then i 'll have melissa go through it. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll point out some of the finer details .i start from my fighting guard , my front foot is going to take a step .i prefer to do the stepping action here , some people prefer to do a spin on the ball of the foot , this is a little bit harder to do , in the beginning , and the spin on the foot can actually change where your kick is delivered .so , i like to go ahead and build up my energy by performing a small step with my lead foot .so , my left foot takes a step forward. [CLS] [SEP]and i turn my heel to where i want to kick and where my head goes , my body follows .so , from the foot , my head twists over , my weight shifts from right leg to left leg .i twist my whole body , see the target and now my right leg lifts , coming out to the side of the body , and i throw the side kick , land .again , more more time , normal speed .i go side step , turn the head , kick , land .melissa lets come forward , we 'll go through a couple little parts of the kick .we have a little bit smaller base than usual , our forward foot takes a step. [CLS] [SEP]and we turn the heel .do that one more again .this one , we actually want to lift the foot from here and bring it to here , as that foot turns .wherever your heel goes is where your target goes. [CLS] [SEP]so really turn the foot more .shift the weight this way , draw this foot over , sliding the toe ,look , now pick this leg up and fire that kick , land .one more time melissa .the foot steps , turn the foot , point the heel , turn the head , look .we want to remember that whenever we 're doing spinning or turning techniques , where your head goes your body follows so your head has to initiate the turn .this is spin side kick , kick boxing .
on breathing now , back to the balloon again , you notice the line .and i taught about the missing cavity back here .just imagine the balloon blowing up only half way .now if i , i squeeze it in here , course i ca n't go that way .but you can tell that , see a balloon does n't operate like that .when you blow it up , it goes all the way out .alright ?so now we have to consciencely think of our diaphragm as a balloon .we have to actually force the muscles back here to go out there .now , generally speaking we do n't develop our latissimus muscles unless you 're a weight lifter. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're focusing on that .but lat muscles get very little attention .but in order to play saxophone correctly , we have to give attention to the latissimus muscles .so we have to look at exercises and ways we can stretch those muscles back there so that we can actually have the capacity to expand and allow air to go back there .so there 's an exercise i 'm going to talk about to actually focus on that .but before i do that i 'm actually going to demonstrate the whole breathing process on the next segment , so you can actually see how it actually goes together .the first step , second step , third step , first step , second step , third step , first step , second step , third step .alright , in doing that there 's a certain way it sounds and a certain way that it looks .and it 's very important that you kind of visually or mentally take note of how it sounded .because i 'm going to do the same thing with a different sound a little incorrectly , you 'll hear how that sounds .you 'll know how it 's supposed to sound , versus how it 's not supposed to sound .alright ?and i believe i 'm going to do that on the next segment .
produce is vegetable or fruit .today we have an onion .an onion needs to be nice and firm all the way around .so obviously what you 're going to do is pick it up and feel it. [CLS] [SEP]and if it ’ s not firm or you feel bruising or you feel any type of dents. [CLS] [SEP]don ’ t get it .you also want to look at it .now , there 's really nothing to look at because onions have a papery like skin all the way around , as you can tell .you want to make sure this skin is nice and tight all the way around your onion , you do n't want there to be any loose spots on your skin of your onion .also , what you can do is basically smell it .it should not have a smell. [CLS] [SEP], it should be nice and a mild of a smell .if you smell any type of moldy type of smell or a musty type of smell. [CLS] [SEP]you definitely don ’ t want to get your onion that ’ s musty or moldy smelling , stay away from that type of stuff .this one has a nice mild smell and as you can see the onion is nice and beautiful all the way around , nice and hard all the way around , and you 've got yourself a beautiful onion .now this is a sweet onion and of course there are a lot of different types of onions but all of them basically have the same structure .they got paper like skin all the way around , same thing with the shallot , so no matter what you 're working with. [CLS] [SEP]you want to use these same basic rules .
i 'll be showing you how to remove and replace a fuel pump on a lincoln continental .o.k , now we 're going to replace our locking ring , that locks the fuel pump in place .lowering it down nice and slowly , you want to see these end grooves that comes from the manufacturer .in this case you 're going to need an assistant to hold two screwdrivers .o.k , now just place one screwdriver right here , and place the other screwdriver right here , press down firmly .now , i 'm going to use the chisel and the hammer to lock it in place , putting the chisel right on the end .that 's right now .when i say apply pressure , then you apply pressure ,o.k .o.k , now we want to apply pressure to the locking rings .i 'm going to take the chisel and the hammer and tap real lightly .and , it 's very important that you get all the lockings tabs locked .you 're going to need to make sure they 're down .
hi , my name is hector inga , owner of lane four swim shop in austin texas , i 've been asked to talk to you about cleaning , or how to clean your swimming goggles .really the care of the swimming goggles are quite simple .our main concern is to get the chlorine or some of the chemicals from the pool and other types of water that you get into , to just to rinse them , rinse as much of the chemicals of the goggles as possible .there 's no need to use soap and water , what we do is just basically dip them in water or rinse them with some tap cold water , clear water .there is not really a cleaner for your lenses , there is an anti-fog spray but that does n't clean them .the rest of the goggles , like lets say the straps , if they get a little grungy you can use a little soapy water , but do not get that on the lenses .in other words , what we want is just to have the inside of the lenses at least just rinsed but not touched .
in this clip we are going to talk about body bags .now a body bag from a hunter 's point of view is not something you carry a body out in but a body bag helps hold your heat in and this item , as far as my hunting items go , is actually my pride and joy of all of my equipment .the body bag even sitting outside , i can stand , because last year i spent six hours in eighteen below weather in this bag with the garments on , that we showed earlier , with those layers of garments .but what the body bag does is it helps protect you from the wind and also help when you close it up .this is a prototype that we are still working on , but they are on the market already .i was looking for one where i can get my hands out to make the shot without actually getting out of the bag .and you could adjust your head gear accordingly , to help maintain your body heat .this body bag will make a tremendous difference in how long you can withstand stay on stand in subzero temperatures .a typical hunt in thirty below temperatures. [CLS] [SEP]you are on stand for about thirty minutes , because of the clothing deficiencies that most hunters have .this bag will add hours to your ability to stay on stand whether you are hunting in northern canada or alaska .this type of equipment becomes very effective .i also like to use this equipment inside of a blind , that 's just sitting on a regular chair where i 'm at here , but it 's real comfortable and you can stay here for hours without getting cramped up and having to move .
and maybe you start picking with your friends. [CLS] [SEP], you might think , `` oh , i 'd like lay down a hot lick somewhere in a song. [CLS] [SEP]but i do n't know where to start . [CLS] [SEP]''a good place to start with a solo is just playing the notes of the chord in a certain pattern to your own liking .for example , here 's an e chord .well , you can pick out those notes in the e chord and you can find ways to put 'em together .it 's a good place to start .you do n't have to be jimi hendrix right away .but to see -- as long as you understand that the solo comes out of the chord notes , it 'll start to make sense to you as you put it together .i 'm no jimi hendrix either .
so you can have as many categories as you like and you can store figures for different scenes and different lights and cameras for different settings and scenes , and so forth , and you can break it down quite nicely .the default setting is poser 7 and a `` downloads folder . [CLS] [SEP]''they give you two folders .so we 're going to double-click on the `` downloads '' folder. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to add this pose to the library by simply clicking on the plus sign at the bottom of the window .this is the pose we want to save in the library .click `` ok '' ...and it saves the pose .now , this pose will be used -- this pose will appear no matter which file i open up in poser .as long as i have this figure loaded in my scene and double-click on this pose , it 'll add it to the scene .
it 's going to be a happy drink .one , two , three , four , five , six , and that 's my two ounce `` pourer '' .a little bit of grapefruit juice for the gentleman .the reason i want to become a bartender , is , i like , i like making , i like making people happy .i really , really like people .and may , i was a lot more shy before i became a bartender .but , being behind a bar , you 've got a safety net .you know , no , nothing can , you know , even if you make somebody really mad , all they can do is like throw something at you , or yell at you , really .when i 'm making a drink , i know right away , whether someone likes their drink or not .it 's instant gratification , you get money. [CLS] [SEP]right then , you get appreciation right then .it 's almost like i 'm gon na , it 's almost a need of , hey look at what i did for you .and , the person goes ,yeah , i loved this , and here 's some money , you know .i mean , how cool is that ?i just , i wanted to be a bartender , it 's kind of cheesy .when i was younger , i saw , you know , cocktails , and that , with tom cruise , and he 's all `` flippin ' `` bottles and stuff .and , i can do that .but , that was the first thing that made me want to do it .and , when i started doing it , i saw all of the things that i made the right decision , for me .because i , i love to make drinks for other people .and whenever i go to parties , you know , i 'm the bartender or whatever .it 's like. [CLS] [SEP], you 're the host of the party .you 're what makes the party happen .it 's like , ok , the bartender 's here , let 's do this .and , that 's very satisfying .
okay now we 're going to do the , a clipper work on the dog 's body .and we 're going to start right behind rosie 's head here and go down her neck , with the grain of the hair .and across her shoulders .this is two comb attachment and we 're using a thirty blade underneath the comb attachment .down the front side .you pull the dog 's skin up just a little bit , stretch the skin you can get a nice even cut with the blade that you 're using .it 's always good to brush the dog out before you use a clipper comb .the clipper comb will go down the dog 's body a lot easier .under the neck .and you can go over it as many times as you want to make it nice and smooth .
one of the coolest things about having an ipod video is being able to take videos with you wherever you go .hi. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm rokosz. [CLS] [SEP]your digital lifestyle expert. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to show you how to put your movies and videos onto your ipod .first thing you want to do is to make sure that you put your ipod cable up to the ipod and plug the usb into the computer .then you 're going to want to launch itunes , and there it is there .now you also want to select your devices , in this case here the rokosz media ipod , and this is coming up the summary .we 're going to navigate over to movies .okay , now to make sure that once we put the movies into it that it gets into the ipod you want to make sure that it 's set up to sync .right now it 's not , so we 're going to sync movies. [CLS] [SEP]and here i 'm going to make it sync all my movies ,so that way i know that if i put it in it 's going to come to the ipod .now you 're saying `` great rokosz , but how do i get the movies into itunes so it gets in the ipod ? ''well , i 'm glad you asked .follow me .what we 're going to do here is launch our finder , which is where all of our files live here .and now i 've chosen my external drive here and into my music videos .and it 's just as simple as drag and drop .i 'm a big dirt nasty fan here. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm going to take old dirt and just add him right to the library .maybe i 'll put some keyboard kid in there , jamming to a little bit of the kid , and drop it right in there .now when i navigate over to my movies section , you do n't want that to apply right now , and there you 're going to see with a title screen or with a thumbnail rather. [CLS] [SEP], you 're going to see mr. [CLS] [SEP]dirt nasty and the keyboard kid and the movie twenty/one that i loaded in .now we just simply go back to our devices , where we were before , movies , make sure we 're clicked on sync movies , down here to apply .synchronization is syncing do not disconnect , when that says it 's okay to disconnect you 're pretty much okay to disconnect. [CLS] [SEP]and then you have your movies ready to travel with you on your ipod wherever you go .i 'm rokosz your digital lifestyle expert. [CLS] [SEP]saying stream you later !
before we get into that , if you have n't already , please see our other subject matters on looking up calorie expenditure charts , and how to keep track of your calories .all of that factors into this subject , how to burn fat .basically , when you 're burning fat , you 're really burning calories .the less calories you take in , and the more calories you use , in a nutshell , that burns your fat .that calls upon your extra energy reserves , and your extra energy reserves , are calories that have n't been used , and calories that have n't been used , turns into fat .what you want to do , is use those up , so in one of our other subjects , we talked about activity factors .all right , so i 'm going to go back to that , and relate it to this subject .so for instance , i 'm a factor twenty , because i work out more than an hour a day , more than three times a week .factor twenty times my target weight , which is a hundred and fifty .twenty times a hundred and fifty , is three thousand calories , but let 's say that i wanted to lose even more weight .i have to say this is a misnomer .for my height , one hundred and fifty , is a healthy weight .for me to lose weight , is actually unhealthy , so. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm using this as an example .if i wanted to lose weight .i wanted to burn fat .i would count myself at a lesser activity factor .factor thirteen is somebody who is sedentary and slightly obese , somebody who is n't very active , and is moderately overweight .if i counted myself at that , factor thirteen times a hundred and fifty , that would bring me to one thousand , nine hundred , and fifty calories a day .for me to continue doing what i do , which is exercising more than an hour .exercising more than three times a week , but taking in only one thousand , nine hundred , and fifty calories .counting myself as less of an activity factor than i actually am , i would definitely lose weight , hence , i would burn fat , because my body would then call upon its extra reserves .stored calories , which is what fat is .fat is calories that have n't been used , and that would definitely burn the calories , and burn the fat .burning the fat , which is the subject of this segment , i do have to say this .if you plan on using this formula , please do consult with your doctor first .rapid weight loss is potentially dangerous for your heart .
ok.now let 's talk about turning the compost pile .well , if it 's all good , and you put this pile together right , you do n't have to turn the compost pile .because , if you layered it right , and you watered it right , and you got your microorganisms in there , and you put the compost inoculate in there , you should n't have to turn this pile .now , obviously , this is a brand new pile that we just made today .but , if for some reason your pile did n't cook down , which means if your pile is four feet high , when it 's finished it should be about a foot and a half high .and it should cook down , and it should go down , and you should be able to see that it looks like compost , not like this material .but if you come across your pile , and it has n't done those things , then you 're going to want to turn your pile .the way we would do that is we would do just like we did in the beginning .we would put holes in the ground so it would drain good .we would create -- add some more sticks , which we 've run out of .but we have plenty in the woods .you would add your leafy -- your garden debris for aeration .and then you would start to turn your pile .you would take the top and you would put it on the bottom , just like this .and if you felt like you wanted to really get going again , that it was n't going quite good enough , then you could go to your garden , do some more weeding , add some more green material in there in the middle .then you would continue to shovel all this , as you can see , and turn it over .if you come across any debris that might be still too bulky , then that 's what this nice fork is .you can smash it , bust it up , put it back in the pile .continue to turn the pile until it 's completely turned and the bottom is now on the top .
ok.i 'm going to show you something that you 're going to use when you 're going to be changing between your instruments. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to be using your control surface to do so .because , you 'll be using your keys on your control surface for different instruments and different parameters and just using reason , just , in general .so , basically under your preferences you can actually choose a couple different options .you have a master keyboard input .now , you can choose either out of two options .you can choose standard or separated .now , under standard it 'll say master key input to selected track .now , basically what that means is when you 're using reason you 'll have your sequencer down here and. [CLS] [SEP]whichever item you 're going to be using will be selected with a red box .basically the red box means that there is midi .this is the instrument that is selected , that the controller surface will be using and also if you see here or if you 're here , i 'm playing here .ok.there is also some green that appears at the bottom of the keys that shows that there is midi input coming into the signal .so , that 's all working correctly .so , then if you choose separated it 's an independent selection and master keyboard output .now , basically what this means is you can click on different tracks , but you will still be controlling the same instrument which is the filtered chords down here that is selected with the red box .the only way that you can change it is if you actually click on a different instrument and it becomes red .you have to click on the instrument inside of this track area .now , you are on a different surface there .so , that is how you use your master keyboard preferences .
notice on this part. [CLS] [SEP]we 've been talking a lot about using the inside of our foot , now we want to use this part of our foot so we can drive through .planting next to the ball and driving the ball through the net .let 's watch luis as he takes a shot .planting next to the ball and driving through the ball as he puts , want to step into your shot .once again using right and left foot .now watch as he really drives through this one .
actually calories are units of energy and so to be honest , just the act of breathing is using calories .but our focus of course , is how to burn calories presumably for weight loss .remember when you are trying to think of everyday ways to burn calories you are calorie counting so every activity has a calorie count value .for everyday ways would be things like housework , garden work , parking a little farther. [CLS] [SEP]then you normally would so you would have to walk to your destination .taking a flight of stairs as opposed to , as opposed to taking the elevator .so again all of that relates to having one of these types of calorie count charts .let me say this again , you can get one of these online , or you can find them in a calorie count book in the health section of your local bookstore .for instance doing gardening , that burns about two sixteen an hour .house work burns about , about one hundred and sixty , one hundred and fifty somewhere around there .you 'll have to see a chart for all those activities but the basic idea is staying active and moving .anything that you can do to keep moving , parking a little farther to walk , running up a flight of stairs as opposed to taking an elevator , lifting things , safely .doing your housework , just a simple act of moving that , that broom or moving that vacuum burns a lot of calories .so just to keep it short and sweet , keep moving that will burn your calories .
i 'm going to come in to the nice knee stretch here .so i 'm going to reach down , grab underneath carrie 's knee , lift the heel and bend the knee , setting off to the side .now i want to place the opposite leg over her leg for a little bit of control .and then i place same side leg underneath .now literally underneath her knee with my toes pointing out , i 'm going to grab a hold of her heel. [CLS] [SEP], kind of make sure that knee 's at a nice ninety degree angle over the hip and then the heel on top of the foot .and then start just gentle pressure of my foot , gentle pulling of the foot , of her foot .and you got to hold for just a few breaths .make sure you ease out a little bit .and then again , just gently leaning back .now notice my back , i 'm trying to make sure that i stay as comfortable as she is .so i 'm keeping my back nice and straight. [CLS] [SEP], shoulders relax down and away from the ears .we 'll do that one more time .relax the energy .then again , lean back , pressing in underneath the , her knee and then gently pulling her foot , nice little knee stretch .releasing the energy , release , we 're going to release it off to the side , giving her just a little bit of a stretch .perfect .straighten your leg out .
just like the time before i talked to you about adjusting to the lanes and everything like that , we are also going to help you find the strike lane as well .now are good strike lane would consist of you throwing the ball and it would basically be in fluent into the bucket where you can get strikes .i have just thrown a couple of balls and have found a strike , so we are going to throw a good ball here .like the time before remember to wipe off your ball of the oil .i got a little bag here to keep the moisture off my hands , that is to make sure i grip the ball good .now line up to your shot , be square to your mark , have a good grip on the ball , now follow through .good strike .now with that i adjusted to the lanes like i did with the clip before , and i found my strike lane .you do that on both sides you will be pretty well set .just pick up your spares and you will do good .
just like any other muscle group , especially the chest because it is a larger muscle group , you need to warm up your body and warm up your chest .so you can start with a nice walk on a treadmill with a with an incline , doing some jumping jacks or some other calisthethenics or push ups would help warm up those chest muscles .once they are nice and warm because you never want to stretch a cold muscle , we will our basic stretches .carrie is going to start out with her chest stretch .she is going to interlace her fingers behind her back .she is going to pull her arms up nice and slow. [CLS] [SEP]and if you have a partner that can add a little resistance this will help pull in the deltoid and up in the chest .you want to hold all these stretches for about 30 seconds or longer , adding tension , and then when the tension goes away you can add a little more tension .next she will do her back stretch. [CLS] [SEP]so she is going to face the front .interlace your fingers and roll her back forward , with her palms facing away , her arms are nice and locked out .she is keeping good posture and she will feel this down her back , again for about 30 seconds .last she will reach down and touch her toes and this just helps work that lower back , the core region that is going to be involved during her chest work outs .alright and during all that she is breathing through the stretches .she is adding tension. [CLS] [SEP]and then when that tension starts to go away she is adding a little more tension making sure she continues to breathe .that should be sufficient for your warm up and stretching .
you 'll need when you shop is some sort of turn tables .a lot of stores will have there own turn table set up .there own listening stations set up , so you can preview music .but also on the same note a lot of them do n't .this is something i brought to take care of the latter part of that problem .it 's a numark portable turntable .essentially what it is , it 's just a turntable for the go .it can plug in to any outlet .comes with its own power supply or you can put in your own batteries in the back .i believe it takes six d batteries .typically when i shop i like to look for singles for a lot of reasons .there a lot cheaper .you know it 's usually going to be six dollars for a single compared to any where from twenty to twenty five dollars for a full length album and also you get the song that you want .there 's one song you picked .it 's on this record , the instrumental , the radio version , the album version , sometimes even an ocapella .whereas the full length you have the whole album .there might be songs that you do n't want to play and you do n't even ever use .so it can be a waste of money .than of course there 's the scratch album that we looked at earlier .so where this comes into play essentially is , you can set up in any record store .it 's a compact and on the move .as you can see here it 's got an on and off button to turn it on and if you do n't want to annoy everyone at the record store. [CLS] [SEP]it has two head phone jacks .so you can plug in and be quiet and listen to a record .so let 's take a look at what this looks like .it actually does produce descent sound .you also want to listen through the whole song so that there 's no skips or scratches. [CLS] [SEP]basically that 's a breakdown in the track where the needle will jump off point and it will skip a whole part of the song and basically a waste of money .one thing when record shopping that you have to play very close attention to is the shape of the record or the warpness .essentially you ?re looking for a one hundred percent flat record .a good way to look at that is to watch the head shell of the needle .if it bounce up and down than the record is warped .you want to play attention to this especially for records you want to scratch with because if the record is warped , and your scratching the motion you put and. [CLS] [SEP]the force you put on the record can cause the needle to jump and jump a track. [CLS] [SEP]and you 'll completely loose where you are on the record. [CLS] [SEP]so play close attention to the shape of your record primarily if your scratching .
and we are in new york city .today on behalf of expert village , i 'm going to show you how to apply makeup for stage .now we 're going to finish off by lining with the red .you can see that this is a really bright red color .kind of fill it in .do your top lip making sure to kind of get pretty close to your natural peaks .almost done .i 've pretty much filled in all of the inside of my lips , and now we 're going to actually add the lipstick and work from there .
and we 're going to go over the toe touch .so with this step really kind of really simple , it 's a good little kid move .it 's going to come here and touch your foot with your hand there .you come here and here. [CLS] [SEP]and you shoot your hand. [CLS] [SEP]and you just wave it down , then you just stop .you 'll do the same thing with this foot , here and up and down .so that last part you want your foot to be up and your hand will be up and your hand is going to kind of make a wavy line like that .here and drop down and when it starts off again you 'll be here and here and up and a down and here and here and up and a down. [CLS] [SEP]okay .so when we put it together it 'll go here and back and up and down and here and here and up and down , out .that 's your toe touch .
in this clip , we 're going to talk about just general placement of the board on the beach you know ,when you want to put it down , you want to make sure that you do it in a nice , soft fashion , you 're not going to damage or scuff the board up .you can be relatively rough with them , but like i said before , it 's an investment and you want to preserve that .things you want to look for on the beach , are sort of drift lines , you see all of these shells right here lining the beach .when the tide comes up , it 's going to , the waves are going to push up all of those shells and a lot of sharp things , and then it 's going to recede and leave all of that stuff there .if you drag it over it , it 's going to basically act like some really , really rough sand paper , and it 's actually going to take off the bottom of the board a lot faster than it would normally do .two different ways to pick the board up , you can either pick it up from one end , and flip it onto its top like this , find the sweet spot and then pick it up .but , if you do that enough times you 're actually going to wear off the nose of the board which we just had to repair before .so , the best way to do it is the same way with a canoe. [CLS] [SEP], they actually call it portaging , you find the sweet spot here in the middle , and you 're going to pick up both ends and just swing it .
talk about. [CLS] [SEP]i think i 'm worth more money , you always here that .otherwise , why would you go into a negotiation of your salary .what happens is most people are n't mentally prepared to justify more money .one of the things that i 've mentioned in the interview process for an example , is that they have a range that they 're willing to pay you .everybody based on someone 's special skills or experience , would consider paying just a little bit outside that range .they 're not going to pay a lot , but they would consider it if you 're that special person .salary negotiation becomes important .there 's a couple things that you have to do and that is one ; do your homework .you need to make sure that the amount of money that you 're asking for is just absolutely not outside the world of the job that you have .the other thing is a lot of people forget about the fact that where you 're actually living can dictate the job .there 's certain places on the west coast to where a job may pay 5 ,000 dollars , and you 're over in another area making 40 thinking ,well i want 85 ,000 dollars .i found out that these people in california make more than double what i make here .well , if you 're living in a small town in south texas , that 45 ,000 dollars might be worth more than that 80 ,000 dollars in california .the first thing you have to do when you 're into salary negotiations. [CLS] [SEP]is you have to make sure that geographically , you know what 's going on where you live and not worry too much about what people living outside your area make .
the capital letter `` b '' .the capital letter `` b '' is built of one straight stroke , ( of course when i say straight. [CLS] [SEP]i mean it 's tipping forward a little bit in the italic style ) and two bowls .so straight stroke plus a bowl , and a second bowl .now let ’ s stop for a minute and take a look at those bowls .we 've got a difference between the top one and the bottom , that one is smaller than that one .so we 're going to make the second bowl , hopefully with enough ink in the pen .there 's not an equivalence between the two parts of the `` b '' .i think it 's helpful to break it into two strokes , each one into two strokes .
and that you are currently under treatment by this doctor for adhd or any other conditions you may have .depression , anxiety , etc , that affect your adhd .its not everybody 's want to start taking medication when they have adhd , and there are any number of things , that. [CLS] [SEP]a person , whether they are taking medication or not can do to help alleviate adhd symptoms and learn to live with some of the complications that this disorder can cause .again , whatever you do in terms of your personal health care and the care of your adhd , its always best to consult your physician before making any major changes .and of course if you want to discontinue your adhd medication , i feel it is imperative you do so under the guidance of your doctor .
well they say the shoes make the man , well , it makes the automatic pool cleaner too .on your cleaner you want to double check that the shoes are really pliable and in good shape .now , it 's true that it only rubbing against a vinyl liner , but over time it really is going to take its tole because it actually pushes and moves , pushes and moves , every time on all four of these shoes , so keeping them in good shape .now , it 's brother inside of a pool , inside of a concrete pool , it 's a situation where sure , it can actually damage the cleaner. [CLS] [SEP]but if you do n't replace these and let these go down , it could damage your liner , and that 's a situation you just do n't want to be in .so , just keep an eye on it and make sure that once these become rough or worn down that you replace them .replacing them could n't be easier .all you have to is bring out our old friend the little flathead there , and you should just sort of ease it in between it .it 's nice and soft there .yep. [CLS] [SEP]and there it goes .pops right out like this .now , it 's important to put them on in the same way facing the same direction .now they 're all going to face forward .if you look very carefully , one is bigger than the other , alright ?as well as one hole is bigger than the other which makes it easy .you ca n't put them on backwards .here 's a trick .sometimes they just do n't want to go in there because you 're pushing against the spring and things .two things you can do .one is i like to wet them a little bit , a little water right over here. [CLS] [SEP]and i sort of moisten them up ,yeah .the other thing is that you can take a screwdriver like this and place it in here so that when you ’ re compressing it you 're not fighting the spring the whole way , and one side then the other , there .repeat it four times .your automatic pool cleaner has got some new kicks .
hi harvy woodier. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm the owner of perfect tan here in orem utah. [CLS] [SEP], we 're a full service tanning salon .we offer twenty different types of tanning beds , as well as the state of the art spray on system like i 'm tanning here .i get asked often what 's the best time , if i 'm on vacation or even outdoors to get a tan .you know you really want to avoid the worse hours , and that 's between ten o'clock in the morning and two o'clock in the afternoon .that 's when the sun is at. [CLS] [SEP]it 's intensity .you always want to make sure you have a high sunblock on , and that 's pf factor of at least fifteen or higher .if you 're fair skinned. [CLS] [SEP]i would say thirty or higher .but , again remember you 're outside and. [CLS] [SEP]you 'll loose track of time .so be careful just in the mid-portion of the day .usually the sun is less intense after two o'clock in the afternoon .really by the time you hit four or five o'clock. [CLS] [SEP]it 's really a lot less intensity there .but always use sunblock when you 're tanning outside .in an indoor tanning facility again , it 's a controlled atmosphere , you can tan. [CLS] [SEP]anytime. [CLS] [SEP]and you do n't have to use a sunblock .and it 's a nice relaxing tan .and you 're in and out of here anywhere from ten minutes to twenty minutes .
i 'm going to show you how to view audio through blocks now .so when you go up to your audio window , you can look at an audio file like this one .right now it 's on a volume within the view which is under the record .you can go to blocks. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to just show the block. [CLS] [SEP], it actually shows some types of fades as well .but it 's not going to show you the actual wave forms , it 's just going to show you the blocks. [CLS] [SEP]so you know where there 's audio data and where there is n't audio data .this , this is helpful cause you can just , if , if everything is aligned to a grid you can move it , you can move the box together too .if you , let 's see if we can go to a grid right now .take this , i can actually consolidate this one .i can just move these , these verses anywhere within my track .i can actually rearrange them and do anything i want with them .see , i wanted to a grab the second verse and replace it with the first verse .i can just grab it right here .copy it , take this one and move it over there .
we 've mixed up some more concrete and we 're just in the process of finishing off this job here .put some back in the bucket , here .once this dries , in a day. [CLS] [SEP]or so , we can come in and lay our tile and that will finish up our floor .the reason that i 'm doing this is , it finishes it and makes it more even with the floor .when the shower pan sits on here it 'll be setting on a nice solid surface and there will be no weak spots underneath it .that 's about good .this does n't have to be worked like regular concrete , if you 're pouring a sidewalk or something because it 's all going to get covered up under the tile .what we 're really after is just , just filling in the hole .ok , that should do it .yeah ,i think that 's good enough .ok , now we 've , we 've gone through the whole process of chiseling out the floor , putting in the drains , rerouting the water lines , and we had our inspection .we passed out inspection so now we filled up to about two and a half to three inches with dirt to cover the pipes. [CLS] [SEP]and then we filled it in with concrete. [CLS] [SEP]so now the tile man can come in , lay the tile , and then we can finish the bathroom .
now the next thing we could do is try to fill in the track .now let 's look at these apple loops one more time and see what else we can add in , maybe add in some type of electric thing .let 's try a little bass right here and let 's try to drag down and extend it .
but it 's for glass .now , the kiln can be used in a couple different ways .the number one way it can be used is to anneal your glass works .now annealing is when you take glass to a temperature and then drop it till it reaches room temperature .now the annealing temperature of the glass that we 're working with is one thousand and fifty degrees fahrenheit .beyond that , when using a kiln , you may place your work in a kiln , while in the midst of working , to take a break or create something else and add it on .this can be very helpful when working on much larger pieces .
so , in this next part you 'll see again a big movement of the spine from backward bending to forward flexion and how these poses really go together .first , the crescent moon .as i 'm easing out that side ,i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]lifting this side of the ribcage up .it wants to collapse .lifting up right here .and , it takes a minute to do .then , sweeping out back toes under .watch the spine .watch the tail .tail lifts , spine just drops .there 's no reason to keep any excess tension around this pose .and , for me i always feel this release through that side .it was lifting really hard in the previous pose .and , now really important to let it rest before asking it to do something else .and , continuing that rest in parsvotanasana which should be even more restful .as i bring this back heel down where the toe just was , did you see that ?a lot of folks want to cross one heel behind the other .i know it 's in light on yoga and other sources to do that .but , i find this really really very very confusing for folks including myself with the pelvic alignment unless the heels are really in line with the sitting bones .so , a little bit of space .in fact , you could lay a tape measure down my mat down the middle of the mat and the left heel would be an inch and a half to two inches on the left .the right heel , inch and a half two inches to the right .they never cross that mid line if i can help it .and , then more back release .even deeper as the arms come up and you balance .big stretch .
now something that you always have to consider when you 're talking about humor is culture .what i am talking about is knowing who are your audience .what group of people-and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm not talking so much about type of people-but are you talking to people from another country ( russia , china , afghanistan , etc ) .every country and culture has different types of humor and different things that they think are funny and acceptable .if you are going to be giving a speech in any type of multicultural environment , it 's always a really good idea to find out what is funny to them ?what is appropriate in the sense of the use of humor to them ?again , you always want to avoid the risk of offending .
so now we 're going to practice this first finger scale on the d , and your elbow is going to adjust just a little bit .and so again , we 're practicing the d major scale , just in a slightly different way .and as you 'll see , as your hand is going up the scale , your hand is starting to have to go around the violin more to reach it , and that 's what you want to do .that 's the movement that you want to have .you do n't want to come up , and try and keep your fingers going up that way .it 's going to be slightly uncomfortable .but you want your whole hand to be moving , and your thumb is going to actually start resting right here in kind of the crook of the neck , and then your hand is going to come around to continue reaching .so that 's the kind of movement that you want as you 're going up in your scale with your first finger .
droppings look like a little pepper , that 's kind of dribbled all over the place .often , if the roaches are really bad , you 'll find them all over your cabinets , inside , outside .what we 're going to do is we 're going to be checking and showing you how we do the treatment , underneath the sink area .as we inspect underneath the kitchen sink , you check for all the little crevasses and corners .when we begin treating , we use our hand sprayer , i 've changed the material in it , and we spray around the edges and corners , trying to get any place where the roaches may be hiding and where they are .i have a machine here. [CLS] [SEP], it 's a fogger , that i use a pyrethrin material that chases the roaches out .basically , you spray it around , you get around to the areas they 're located in , back in the crevasses , back in the corners where you ca n't see .it 's going to chase them out , putting them into the material and killing them instantly .there 's other different methods that i actually use besides using these two machines is different types of bait .depending on the severity and the problems and issues that arise , we 'll use either a bait or a liquid application , if it 's really bad , a mixture of both , depending on setting and location and homes .
one thing i am going to teach you right now. [CLS] [SEP]is how to read the lane .one thing is when you are in a league and you are taking some practice shots , you want to grab like your most aggressive ball that you have. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to throw it and adjust from that shot .so i am going to throw one shot. [CLS] [SEP]and i am going to adjust from their .so what happened on that shot is i actually hit my mark. [CLS] [SEP], i threw my ball how i should throw it. [CLS] [SEP]but it ended up going high in the pocket .so , that ball in a game or two would actually not work cause the lanes would actually become drier .so i am going to switch balls , i am going to throw the same mark , but i am going to throw a ball that is not as aggressive .so the same thing basically happened on that one .i am going wind up having to use a dry lane ball to adjust to this shot .the oil right now is at a short pattern .so it is only about 30 feet down where the oil is at .and so , in a couple of games it is going to become really , really dry .that ?s a good way of learning how to read the lanes and how to adjust to the shot .
all right .so , now we 're going to go over some more basic techniques , slapping and muting .now , a lot of conga playing -- especially if you 're playing in -- with just a guitar , there 's some nice , sentimental atmosphere. [CLS] [SEP], you want to just play light. [CLS] [SEP]and you do n't want to project as much .so , you want to just --a lot of musicians just keep one hand on there .and for a slap , just keep it muted .and if you loosen your hand and slowly pick it up , you can get different color tones .so , i 'm changing the amount of pressure i put on the head .so , i 'm muting it. [CLS] [SEP]and you get more of a slap tone out of it .you can mute with just one hand too by putting a hand here and going. [CLS] [SEP]-- so it 's kind of a lazy technique .so , just play it like your hands. [CLS] [SEP]are heavy .notice , my hands are straight like this , really slouched .and you can get different ring tones out of the middle too by --so there 's all these different color tones you can get out of the instrument by applying your hands in different pressures , in different positions on the instrument .
next i 'm going to use a little bit of turquoise paint .just a lighter blue and give our face a little bit of a like eye shadow .so we 're doing it along the line of our pink eye marking and over the white and just a little bit of a swoosh .ok.now we 'll use a little dark blue and give the eye to the center of the eye .and the placement of that eye will , you know , kind of give the direction where the puppet will be looking .so , you want to think about that a little bit where you 're going to place that blue dot .it changes the expression depending upon where you put it .and again we want to let that dry before we put the next color on .now we 'll finish off our puppet face with some detailing .and i 'm going to use a brown color .and i 'm just watering it down a tiny bit and. [CLS] [SEP]because i want just a little bit of paint on my brush .you can , you just want to be able to make very fine lines .and we 'll outline the eyes a little bit .and you kind of go just under that blue eye shadow .just very , very lightly .and you can outline the eyes using a tiny bit of paint , tiny bit water just to get a very fine detail .and then we 'll make some eyelashes .and just , just little , little lines for eyelashes .and for underneath you can do just tiny dots .the brown you can also use to outline the nose .just a delicate nose .and also use the brown as a little bit of detail for the lips .just outline tiny bit for the lips .and then if you want to make some hair you can either use a trim like this for hair .and that goes on really cute .you 'll just glue that on , all these tassely trims .even a silver tassel like this. [CLS] [SEP]and then you pull it over and glue it out of the face .that makes cute hair .or you can paint the hair on .and you just take a brown paint and paint it on like this and then use your detailing brush to just bring in some little curls and bangs .so here 's our puppet with her hair. [CLS] [SEP]and she has painted on hair .this one here has some silver tassel for hair and we 've just glued that on .i 've put a little bit of a ribbon trim so that looks like a crown for her head .and then on this one i used a also a tassely trim , but a kind of a curly tassel trim .and i 've also utilized both sides of the styrofoam ball for the head .so i 've got beauty and the beast .
now loading loops in a song is pretty easy from your apple loops .your apple loops has tons of loops already there. [CLS] [SEP]and what you really want to do. [CLS] [SEP]is just try to find them just by auditioning them .what i can do is just go , pick here , and just kind of click on whatever i want. [CLS] [SEP]and it should just play it .what i 'm going to do is try to raise the beat up a little bit .so what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to take one of these beats and just load it up into my drum in my arrange window .next what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to try to bring it over .now with this drum loop actually in my sample i could also go into other loops and audition them while this one is playing .so i press play. [CLS] [SEP], maybe i 'll look at the guitars from them .
we 're gon na pot up some of our succulents here .we have to find an appropriate size pot for some of these , that looks like it 'll be a nice little plant , about that size .so , we 're going to take some of our potting mix and put it in and just take an extra leaf off of this one. [CLS] [SEP]and there 's one .stick it right in .i got ta remember to leave a little room for my water because this one is not going to compact down as much as a regular mix .just for fun maybe we 'll do a couple of leaves. [CLS] [SEP], we 'll see how they would grow out .i think i would just stick them right on top , they 'll find their own way .they 're ready to go .four new little plants .
hearts adaptive of riding where in santa barbara , california. [CLS] [SEP]and we have been in existing for 22 years. [CLS] [SEP]currently we serve about 60 disable riders a week .we take care both adults and children of disabilities our riders go from age 4 to age 84. [CLS] [SEP]and they come with many different disabilities from physical , mental , or connotative .these two riders here at the therapeutic center are adult rider .the rider in front in the white shirt has a disease called fibromyalgia which is very much like ms multiple sclerosis and the rider behind her in the yellow tee shirt is a mentally retarded adult women who has a job , who lives independently but coming riding in the therapeutic riding center is her highlight of the week. [CLS] [SEP]it is her recreation .for the rider in front she working on her muscle strength , her confident. [CLS] [SEP], she first came about 5 years ago to go in shape on a backpack ride life packer with horses and she has been coming back every since because it makes here feel physically and mentally .
now a lot of times when you are doing stuff you might want to reset , you might want to start from the beginning , you might want to clear certain things , especially when you are working with presets because you might pull up a preset and you like the way the kick is. [CLS] [SEP]but you do n't like the way the snare is. [CLS] [SEP]an the high hat is so what i am going to show you is how to clear certain things .now in looking at the ultra beat the way to get a very base thing is the drag and drop samples .this is going to help you to bring in sounds the way they naturally are. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm going to go here , drag and drop samples , and now i 'm going to do this. [CLS] [SEP]and there are ways to clear patterns and things like that also and like you can also load up another track or another kit and clear the actual patterns one by one so going into the electro kit i can look at this pattern right now and press the control key and clear it .i can also go into any other track and do the same exact thing .another thing i can do is clear the samples out of here by dragging them out or dragging no sample inside of it .
part of the challenge of doing the foliage is that there is so much going on that it 's hard to keep it all straight .so , let 's keep it simple .we 've drawn that one in the center .let 's establish the ones that are clearly sub-visible , the ones that are nearby , like that group under this group of flowers .and not worry about what 's going on in the background .we 'll worry about what 's going on in the background after we 've established the basic shapes of the primary leaf groups .that leaf group has a large area of a pure green .and let 's establish that dark edge along the very bottom which establishes its serrated edge .for that group .and now that we 've established the basic shape that it has. [CLS] [SEP], let 's come back in with some of the lighter values that represent where the light is falling on it .and there 's a little light over here as well .and that 's getting pretty close .still needs some more highlights , still needs some more dramatic darknesses .and this green is almost blue .some of the veins ' patterns are visible in that darker blue .especially where it is in that light lit area .and then there 's that shadow .and here 's another vein area .and against every time that there 's a vein , you can see that there 's a dark line .and there 's a highlight as well .one ca n't exist without the other .
the next thing we are dealing with is rotating the tires .now what rotating the tires does is it promotes even wear of the tire 's surface .if you start off with new tires you want to rotate your tires regularly .we usually do this maybe every 6 or 7 ,000 miles just to insure that you have proper tire wear .basically what you do depending on what kind of vehicle application you have is you want to take on some german cars you just rotate the tires side from side. [CLS] [SEP]so you just take the front tire and put it on the back and the rear tire on the front .in other applications you want to take and crisscross the tires. [CLS] [SEP]so you would take your left rear tire and it would go on the right front. [CLS] [SEP], then the right rear tire goes on the left front , left front. [CLS] [SEP]goes on the right rear. [CLS] [SEP], the right front goes on to the left rear so that is how you promote the general tire wear. [CLS] [SEP]and then if you want to include your spare tire into that , if you had a full size spare tire you can rotate that in that fashion and just add the spare tire wherever you need it and then dealing with directional tires is what this tire is right here .it has kind of like a v pattern to the tire. [CLS] [SEP]so whenever you have directional tires on the vehicle the tires that are on the right side would get switched on the right side and the tires on the left side would get switched on the left side .so you know you just want to make sure you keep up on the rotating of the tires so that you do n't have to overspend the amount of money that you need to on buying tires and so on and so forth and to get the complete use out of your tires. [CLS] [SEP]so that concludes rotating the tires .
and now for a couple of stupid criminal tricks .first we have a pair of seniors , sixty-five in new york , whose pal suddenly died .he had his three hundred and fifty-five dollar social security check uncashed .so you know what they did ?they put him in a wheelchair , wheeled him down to the local check cashing center , and they were going to try to pass him off as still alive so they could get that money .however , when they entered , a policeman , a plain clothesman , spotted the body and realized that the man in the chair was dead , and they were arrested .stupid criminal trick .now i have another case , a woman down in new zealand was in a store. [CLS] [SEP]and she was taking clothes and stuffing them under herself , under her own dress .a cashier came over and asked her what she 's doing , what that bulge was , and she said it was a hernia .however , the woman did not believe her and security found that she had several clothes stuffed under her dress around her chest area .it was n't a hernia .another stupid criminal trick for your consideration .
hi , my name is ashley ludman from seaside yoga , here to tell you a little bit about power yoga .power yoga is a system of vinyasa yoga which means you 're linking your movements in moving pretty steadily from one pose to the next .so with that , you have to create a sustain breath , called ujjayi breath , which i 'll demonstrate in just a moment .and with power yoga you 'll create a balance between strength and flexibility .you 're using your internal heat to sustain the benefits of the hot internal practice .so in vinya or in power yoga rather , you 're using not just flexibility in trying to go deeper into the postures , but you 're trying to use your strengths to sustain yourself in the posture .so ujjayi breath is created by a gentle toning of the throat muscles and it creates a sound similar to a dark vader sound or an ocean sound if you hold a cup shell up to your ear .it sounds something like this .and this ujjayi breath helps to regulate your internal focus and the heat within movement between posture to posture .i 'll demonstrate just a little bit of power yoga , you can join with me if you want to .so we 'll start at the beginning of the mat , at the front of the mat , place your hands to your heart and engage your ujjayi breath .also , you want to engage your deep core muscles to help you sustain the posture from the center , from the core .breathing in , stand tall , and exhale fold forward to uttanasana , standing forward bend .then inhale , strongly lengthen your spine , look forward , exhale fold back and place your hands and jump back to plank .from here you can lower yourself and hover in chaturanga , breathing steadily .inhale slide forward and come up to upward facing dog .exhale , engage from your core and stretch back to downward facing dog .bend your knees , look forward and step or hop lightly .inhale and stretch forward .exhale , fold forward .inhale and rise .exhale , hands to heart .now you may repeat that cycle a few times before coming into some of the strengthening , standing postures .and that is the sun salutation , it helps to create increased heat and it helps to loosen up the body 's joints , the hips and the shoulders and the spine so that you can sustain more of the static poses in a stronger way .i 'll just give you one more pose that you might see in a power yoga class. [CLS] [SEP], this is called utkatasana or powerful seat .and you 'll stand with your feet distance of your hips , sitting back like you 're sitting into a chair .engage your core strength , lifting your rib cage from your core and stretch your arms forward .so it 's kind of like a ski stance , like you 're getting ready to go down the hill .but you hold this for as long as you can hold it , five breaths to begin , ten breaths maybe .and you 're not sinking in heavily , but instead you 're lifting up out of the strength of your legs , out of your core , out of even your shoulders .bring your hands to your heart , take another breath and exhale release the pose .do that for five to ten breaths and you 'll feel the benefits of power yoga .thanks for joining me .
we have now pinned the light weight suede fabric that would be the center piece to the leopard print. [CLS] [SEP]and we are ready to sew that section .again i 'm using a half inch seam allowance .i always like to reinforce the edge so it would not separate it and start coming apart from me later .always a good idea .some fabrics are a little bit slippery to sew on this light weight. [CLS] [SEP]suede that i 'm using has a slick backing .it is moving a little bit slower then usual .i have to make sure i get a nice straight line .that takes care of that seam and we would continue sewing the pieces together in the next clip .
alright , the drink that we 're about to make is called beer top .and what we 're going to do is put ten ounces of beer in a glass .so , what i would suggest , maybe just taking a couple sips of a twelve ounce beer , and you should have about ten ounces left .nice and foamy , alright .next thing we 're going to do is add two ounces of seven up .now , let 's go ahead and do that .do n't worry , a little foam on the bar mat , it 's not going to hurt anyone .and we 'll go ahead and mix that up a little bit .now , this is a great drink to enjoy on a hot summer day , looking just to give your beer a little bit of a lime , lemon lime kick to it , this is going to be just for you .and also , it is known to be great for the night after a , a long night of drinking .go ahead and make yourself a beer top , and enjoy .bottoms up .
i 've moved my hands to create a lumbar stretch here .i 'm pushing away with my right hand here , stretching out this lower-lumbar area .it 's very good if you 're partner. [CLS] [SEP]has any kind of lower-back pain , which is very common .back pain is always about support , feeling supported .obviously physically you 're supporting yourself .if you 're picking up your child , it 's all registering in your lower back .but , it also could be an emotional support .if you 're not being supported by you ... [CLS] [SEP]at work , or your relationships , a lot of this manifests itself in lower back pain .so we 're slowly working this area , and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm using my palm and my fingertips to slowly work above the sacrum here .little circles , little circles , just opening it up a little bit here .my left hand is more of a mothering hand , just to be centered here over the heart chakra .do you feel that stretch ?uh-huh .okay , next we 'll move to working along the spine .
carrots add an important balance. [CLS] [SEP]to tomato sauce. [CLS] [SEP]a red sauce has a lot of acid and carrots balance that out with there adherent sweetness .we have a couple of carrots. [CLS] [SEP]regular old carrots they do n't have to be anything fancy. [CLS] [SEP]they all do the same thing .if i was making carrots as a side dish i go for something a little different. [CLS] [SEP]probably something that is called nantse carrot. [CLS] [SEP], that is a little french carrots that is just beautiful .maybe a bonefied baby carrot not those bag carrots that are cut to there really big carrots cut small to look like baby carrots .but actual baby carrots with the tops on them make a really nice side dish , you saute them with a little olive oil , butter and honey .but for this purpose the carrots are going to lend there sweetness to a red sauce and that 's what we 're doing here .i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]just peeling the thin skin off the vegetable peeler is useful for this as oppose to a pairing knife because you see how thin the skin is and how easily it just comes right off , without sacrificing any of the carrots .we 'll get our skin off there. [CLS] [SEP]and we want kind of a uniform dice as i said cause we want them to cook the same rate. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm just going to cut them into manageable pieces. [CLS] [SEP]so they 're not rolling around my cutting board .then we can dice them up keeping your fingers out of the way of course , let 's do it again with this one .after we finish with prepping these carrots we 're ready to start cooking. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to start by sauting our sausage in some butter and olive oil. [CLS] [SEP], see you then .
next i want to introduce to you the heaven kick .it 's a little bit difficult for most people .you need a lot of flexibility and stabilize your foot .
a slur is this curve line. [CLS] [SEP]right here , it could be a part of passage as you see here and this slur could go above the notes or the slur may appear below the notes .slur means that all of these notes are slurred together .a slur may also happens between just two notes as we see right here .this is a slur from an e up to a d and this would be smooth and connect the air will not stop .all that slur means is that the two notes are connected and you do n't stop the air in between .so if for example you saw a a and then a c. [CLS] [SEP]and there was no slur. [CLS] [SEP], it would be two distinct notes .like so .if you were to slur them they would be nice and smooth .now when slurring i 'm keeping the air study and constant. [CLS] [SEP]so the air would never stop .i keep on blowing and all that changes is my fingering if the changing notes is also changing fingering and my embouchure but the air never stops .you could play entire passages as slurs if that is how they are written and that is how you play a slur .
i will show you how i teach skating .the first exercise what you need is then stepping , stepping in the place but in the place ,just stepping pay attention .bend the knees yes and bend your body for while a little bit .yes this is a very important basic exercise .you will experience the shifting of body weight the center of the gravity .you should hold your balance. [CLS] [SEP]yes .it so easy but very very important .the next exercise is skating in the place , that ’ s interesting just experience feel the ground feel the surface .but try it just try it do n't step. [CLS] [SEP]just try this .do n't be afraid it 's easy .bend your body for a while a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]yes .this is good. [CLS] [SEP]bend your knees always. [CLS] [SEP], always bend your knees to stabilize the balance .this is the importance of this task .
now that we are done with those creases what we are going to do is go ahead and unfold it and reverse fold it .this is what i mean what we have here. [CLS] [SEP]this is where we left off .we are going to open it up like so. [CLS] [SEP]and we are just going to crease this to the inside .this is going to come in like this. [CLS] [SEP]and this crease would fold back down like so .line that along that. [CLS] [SEP]and then this crease right here .bring this back across. [CLS] [SEP]and we would have this diamond shape this little wing sticking out like this .so we are going to do the same thing over here and open it up .fold that piece down that way , take this piece back that way , fold it down under the crease .it is already created just like that and what we want. [CLS] [SEP]to do we want to crease inside crease both of these pieces here. [CLS] [SEP]and we would do that in the next step .
i 'm an international visionary artist and. [CLS] [SEP]i welcome you to my home studio .what we 're going to today is i 'm going to show you inside my home , show you some of the paintings that i 've been working on for the past twenty years , and then i will be showing you the process of painting a mural .i 've been commissioned to do a very large , four wall mural for the local india palace restaurant .so i will be taking you through the process of how i create that mural .i will be creating a small rough sketch for the whole of the mural to show the owner , and then we will be going to the restaurant and focusing on just one section of the mural .i will be painting that whole section from beginning to end .when that 's complete , then we 'll pan out with the camera and show you all four walls and how the whole thing comes together .
okay , here we 're going to go over the idea of a pendulum .so , if you think of your upper body as part the pendulum , using these two clubs to keep my club ; putting club head on line here .so , all i want to do is take the club back. [CLS] [SEP]and you see how it 's a pendulum motion .this way you eliminate a lot of motion in your body and your hands so you can keep the putt on line .the secret to a good putt ; at least getting the right speed and. [CLS] [SEP]the right line is to keep your club head from moving all over the place .so , i use these two guide posts so i can keep the club on a pendulum type motion and that will help make my putts that much more accurate .there 's a lot of little tricks in putting because once again these ; the putts really count for a lot of strokes in golf even though you may consider it the least athletic of everything you do out here , they count a lot .so , you 've got to find a way to get this nice pendulum motion .so , you 're using your body to putt because you do n't want to use your hands when you putt .you do n't swat at it with your hands .you use the body in somewhat of a pendulum motion .so , try to get that rhythm and feeling .you do n't even need to have to have a ball .just think about being relaxed and moving in a pendulum motion and that will really help your putting motion when it counts .
all right .so here we go with the beat .i 'm at 80 bpm .this is the down of one , down of four , up of four .take a listen , take a look .makes sense ?so i 've got beat four , all three lining up ; up of four , kick and hi-hat ; down of one , kick and hi-hat .all right ?so let 's play it together .i 'll count you off .we 're at 80 bpm .one , two , ready , play .all right ?feel good ?if you 're having a hard time keeping up , slow it down a little bit down to 70 , down to 60 , work it out , isolate those individual parts and then move forward .
now i 'll teach you the signs for hyper and mellow .hyper .again , you 'll use your facial expression to show if someone is extremely hyper or high strung .you might show that they 're hyper by having them bounce against the ceiling .or , incorporate the sign for excited and hyper .you can be creative with that one .mellow , or laid back .mellow , relax .mellow .let 's review ; hyper , very hyper , or you might even sign restless , like they ca n't sit still .restless .bouncing off the ceilings .mellow , relax .practice those signs , good job .
so in a word like `` mother '' , you and i would say `` mother '' , they would say `` motha '' , the `` r '' just disappears .we would say `` cheerful '' , they would say `` cheeful '' .so the `` r '' just does n't exist anymore , and it primarily follows a vowel .in the word `` cheerful '' you 've got a vowel , so it becomes `` cheeful '' .`` mother '' , you 've got an `` er '' , so it becomes `` motha '' .and i 'm going to give you a drill in just a minute on a lot of words where you 've got a vowel. [CLS] [SEP]and then you drop that `` r '' .and this is going to sound real familiar to you , this is what 's going to start making this sound like a new york dialect .
so this king pigeon , which i 've been calling big pigeon , because the front of the shin is parallel with the front of the mat .and if you pull the heel in closer , it 's really a different pose because of the structure of the muscles of off .so a lot of folks want to pull in , but , it 's never going to cultivate this position if you do that .so i think it 's better just to work with what you have and be patient .so i have a lot of variations to help students open .we do quite a bit of this in the class .the first is to simply work with the spine .you know , you may find your pelvis is n't really pointing where you want it to point , it 'd be nice if we just lie flat , maybe it 's not lying flat , maybe it 's pointing out to the sides somewhere .you 're all uneven .in this case , lead with the head , take your head where you 'd want to want it to go and let the spine follow .think of this as time lapse photography , may not happen all in one session , it may take a period of months to open up this way , but , pulling the head where i want it to go .eventually , the spine and then the pelvis will follow .and also , notice i 'm pulling , i 'm holding on with these back toes. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]pulling back , making space and forward , making space .once you 're reasonably balance , so you can start to play , you can rock side to side .as i go side to side , i get all those little spaces to open up .then i can press with my right hand on my right knee , i 'm really going to push it down and even pull it away a little bit , kind of this motion when the arm is pulling the legs slightly forward out of the hip socket , making some space so i can come up .and just coming up a comfortable amount , i 'm not trying to bend backwards .then if you like , you can bend your back leg , take hold of it , with one or both hands , trying to remain balance and upright , pull the leg back .and to go deeper , switch hands , opposite hand to foot for spine twist .coming forward , stretch out the back , lie down on it .
i 'm jk dooley and. [CLS] [SEP]we 're talking today about giclee reproductions. [CLS] [SEP]and i 've already discussed the importance of picking an actual person to do your printing and making sure that they know what they 're doing .now i 'm going to talk just very briefly on actually choosing a printer if you 're going to be printing yourself as far as choosing the equipment .very important that you go online , you visit some people , you do a lot of research and just ask a lot of questions .there 's a lot of products available on the market .obviously , this was not printed by a desktop printer so you can see that there 's more involved than just your average run of the mill printer .so you 've got a printer that can go from printing this size on paper up to this size on canvas .so there 's a lot to think about .probably one of the most important things that i looked for , and this sounds real basic , but how much ink does it use .that 's definitely a question to find out because if you have a printer that 's an ink hog you 're going to be spending an awful lot of money just on that .so check and see what kind of support they have for you technically if you have questions .you want to make sure that it 's affordable and if it 's not affordable , is there financing .a lot of things to think about if you 're going to buy the type of equipment that you need to print these types of prints .
off season training for football .stiff legged dead lifts with dumbbells .this is the beginning our third superset for this workout .we 're going to take a pair of dumbbells , because we 're also going to help develop scapulas stability while doing the dead lift .so jones is going to take the two dumbbells , he 's going to stand with his feet hip width apart , he 's going to start looking straight out at the horizon and then push his hips straight back keeping a stiff lower back and then push the hips forward .feel that your heels push down and into the ground and back .it 's really going to help develop strength through the gluts and the hamstrings .that will help translate over for speed for you and also help condition your hamstrings to prevent injury .he 's keeping his chest nice and big and wide open as he 's working .we 're going to do ten reps of these before moving on to renegade rose .
we are going to go and stir all of our vegetables so that they are nice and incorporated and once they are more or less we will come on to our baking sheet and pour our items on the top. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 'll take some parmesan and just sprinkle that over the top. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to put this in the oven and bake it just until the cheese has started to bake or turn a dark color. [CLS] [SEP]and that should be about five minutes or so .so now we are going to remove our pears and these should be very fragrant right now. [CLS] [SEP]and i will scoop just a little bit of that juice in there as well ,and then we are just going to pulse these until they are all blended into a puree .i want to open this up to make sure we have got all the big chunks and just push them back down so that the blade can reach them .
we 're going to continue now with stringing a guitar .we had just found that holding the string up about 3 inches above the neck is about as much slack as you need , while keeping the string from going through the tuning peg with the left hand .once you have that , hold the string with your right hand so that it does n't move , hold the guitar up , and begin tuning the string by making sure that it goes around the outside before around the inside .you 'll notice that the string comes up along the outside of the headstock .hold it with your right hand , so you 're pulling it tight , and the first time around , this is my personal preference , a lot of people do this their own ways , but , i like to go over the string the first time through. [CLS] [SEP], notice i went over this piece here .and then the second time around , go underneath the hole where the string comes through , that will kind of sandwich the string in there to prevent it from gaining slack .now , when you start feeling the string to get a little bit tense , stop there for a moment , make sure that the string is going over the bridge here , in the right place , which it appears it is , and then it sounds a little funny because we 're not done stringing it up .there 's a saddle up here , you want to make sure it goes under the saddle .and you want to make sure it also goes through the nut , which is this right across here .so now it 's sitting in their properly. [CLS] [SEP], we 've got a little bit of tone and then we 'll get to tuning .
we 're here today with henry. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to talk about how to teach a cat to use a cat door .what i 've got here behind us is a little cat door that i have actually taken the magnet off .a lot of the doors come with a little magnet , it 's meant to keep the door from swinging and open and shut in the wind .and keep the rain out and help keep the air conditioning and heat from leaving the house .but it can be a bit of a deterrent , some of those magnets are pretty strong .so what i 've done is take the magnet off to make it a little easier for henry to get used to pushing his head through that .now here i 've got my freeze dried chicken treats .it 's a particular favorite of henry , just to give him a little incentive for getting through the door .now i 'm actually going to kind of push him , give him a little heave ho , through the door , just to get him started .here we go , so now he 's on the inside of the door .now this is just a little kitty veranda , you could be training your cat to use the cat door in and out or use the cat enclosure or even a cat door , to get into their bathroom .so now what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to try and help him get used to coming in and out .i 'm going to take the door , you know. [CLS] [SEP]when he pushes his head against it , he 's going to be pushing out , so i want to get him used to having that feeling on his forehead .come here henry .he 's kind of enjoying being out there , which is good. [CLS] [SEP]cause you , you know you want them to enjoy the place that the door goes to so that without the treats they have an impetus for coming and going .now i 'm going to put , ooooooh there you go .and lets try and get you to come out. [CLS] [SEP], can you push on that door .push , push , push , here we go come on .oh good boy .good job henry .here we are with another cat door , this one leads to the outdoor enclosure that i have here .so it 's , there 's a lot of draw for the cats to learn how to use this door , because they like going out here .but they did have to get used to this one. [CLS] [SEP]does have the magnet unlike the one upstairs .and it 's , instead of being stiff. [CLS] [SEP]it 's kind of flexible , so. [CLS] [SEP]what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to show henry his treat .here 's your treat. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to push it right outside the door there .ohh and there he goes .usually what i like to do when i 'm training them to use the door. [CLS] [SEP]is kind of assist them with it and then assist them with it less and less until really you 're just gone .this is another time if you have taught your cat how to come , to a come command. [CLS] [SEP]it makes it easier to train them to do the other things that you want them to do .unless they 've decided that they want to hang out outside .come good boy .good boy , there you go .and now he 's coming all by himself .
okay .now that we have our produce cut , we have our green onions , our yellow , green peppers , our lettuce , tomatoes , red onions , and cilantro , now we 're ready to cook the meat .so what we 're going to do first. [CLS] [SEP]is start with the onions .a little bit of oil in a hot pan , onions .then we 'll brown off the meat and take it from there .so you want maybe two tablespoons of oil , and we 'll add our onions .you always want to do the onions first .so we 'll get there in there .we 're going to brown off our onions .once they 're brown , then we 're going to add our ground beef .our onions are browned off nicely .they 're translucent .now , we will add the ground beef .going to add the meat , just going to break it up .if you put the whole meatball in there , it 's a different recipe .so we 'll break the ground beef up .then we 're going to brown the meat up .as you 're stirring it , continue to break the meat .now , i 'm not adding any seasonings at this time .what i like to do is brown the meat first .then i pour off any excess grease .and once the grease is poured off , then i 'll add the seasonings .a reason being if i season it now. [CLS] [SEP]and then we pour the grease. [CLS] [SEP], we 're pouring half our seasonings down the drain .so right now , no need for seasoning .we 'll get the ground beef nicely browned , and we will season the beef .we 'll add the remaining ingredients .then we 'll be ready to cook eggs .
ok , a lot of times you may notice pro golfers at a tournament , they reach down , they grab some grass , and then they toss it up like that .so that 's going to give them , the reason they do that , it 's going to give them the direction of the wind. [CLS] [SEP]exactly cause you 'll just see the way the grass blows. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 'll be able to adjust your shot .so the wind is something that , how do you learn to play the wind .well , you have to get experience. [CLS] [SEP], you got to practice it .but if you know before your shot , you toss the grass up , you 'll know exactly which way the wind is going and then you can adjust your shot accordingly .if it 's a very mild wind it might not affect your shot at all .but the higher iron you hit which means the higher you ’ re going to hit the ball especially when you 're trying to get to the green , the more the wind will affect your shot .so you have to take into account , if you 've got a reasonably good wind blowing in your face. [CLS] [SEP]you 're going to grab at least one more club or. [CLS] [SEP]if it 's such a strong wind. [CLS] [SEP]you might start thinking about hitting the ball lower so taking a different club and maybe pitching the ball up .so , there 's a lot of variables that come with the wind. [CLS] [SEP]so remember , so now the wind is kind of coming at this angle here. [CLS] [SEP]so if i 'm going to hit the ball straight , it 's going to bend the ball a little back , a little bit back toward me .so you want to take that into account when you hit the ball because three mile an hour winds are nice little breezes that can keep you cool. [CLS] [SEP]but ten , fifteen , twenty , twenty-five mile an hour. [CLS] [SEP]winds really affect the shot. [CLS] [SEP]so you have to learn how to account for it. [CLS] [SEP]but you got to get the knowledge of which way it 's blowing in the first place .
what we 're talking about right now is the jobs and the duty of our point guard .now our point guard has many responsibilities .one is to get the offense started , one is to be the general on the floor , but sometimes , after the point guard gives the ball away to a wing player or a post player. [CLS] [SEP], it 's also his responsibility to make sure that the play is continuing to work .if that play , at any in time , breaks down , that point guard 's responsibility is , he 's going to have to get himself open , not only for maybe a shot , but to get the ball back to reset a different offense or to reset the offense that we 're currently in .so , what we 're going to show you right now are a couple of techniques that we use with our point guards to get them open .so , i 'll play a wing player right now .and our point guard is going to give the ball away , and then he 's going to act as if he 's going away .now maybe he 's going to go away and set a screen , but if he realizes that when i catch the ball on the wing , if i 'm heavily guarded and i ca n't get the ball away , he may have to come and get the ball .so this is something that we call a `` v '' cut , which means that he is going to run his man down , and then all of a sudden he 's going to stop , he 's going to cut , and come right back to the ball .now , from there , he can either recall another offense or he can change the offense that he 's in , or he can try to drive and shoot .the other one that we 're going to have is that we 're going to show that sometimes we have a play where the point guard will give away to the wing , and then he 's going to cut inside .sometimes we have them cut , sometimes if we get in trouble , they 'll fake their cut and then pop back up to the top to receive the pass .pop back down .now he 's going to come back up , he 's going to receive the pass , and we can reset the offense again .so , just because you 're a point guard , does n't mean that you give just give the ball away. [CLS] [SEP]and then you let the rest of the offense happen .this guy has got to be responsible for coming back and getting the ball if anything ever breaks down .
here are two recipes for making massage bars .these are probably the most popular bars as mostly everybody will appreciate one after a hard day 's work .and the first one we 're going to make is using the olive oil ; clear olive oil .we have three ounces melted here and we 're going to add a teaspoon of this apricot seed and a couple drops of the camel meal fragrance. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to incorporate all that seed really well .these molds have these bumps on them in large and small patterns and they just feel great in the shower or bath .and we 're going to do one here out of an apricot scrub. [CLS] [SEP]and then the other recipe. [CLS] [SEP]we 're going to make. [CLS] [SEP]is on eucalyptus bar .and that is made with the avocado. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to use our fragrance stress relief ; a couple of drops of that. [CLS] [SEP]and then a teaspoon of the eucalyptus leaf .and that 's getting stirred into four ounces of the avocado base .if you 're not sure what size your mold is , you can fill it with water and then pour the water in and that will tell you exactly how much soap to melt .some of the mold have it listed right on there and others do n't and that 's a good tip for knowing how much soap you need to use per mold .now we 're going to let those set up until they are hard .now our message bars have set up and are firm , and a good trick to remember for releasing them from the mold is to put your mold in the freezer for five minutes or so .especially with all these little bumps , the message ball that helps to pop them right out .but first we have our , there we go , our apricot message bar. [CLS] [SEP]and there 's our eucalyptus message bar .they make great gifts .
i 'm an aesthetician and makeup artist at ulta salon and cosmetics. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to show you how to remove eye liner .so you want to get an eye makeup remover .my favorite type 's a eye makeover remover , or silicone and water mixture .you just want to shake it up .actually like to use a cue-tip or cotton swab .dunk it in .kind of just blot any extra moisture off of it , especially if i 'm planning to reapply makeup afterwards .look up for me .and then i 'm just going to be able to do this right under her lashes , without even messing up here mascara .gon na take the dry end of my swab , back through , pick up any excess , any moisture .and that just took it right off , and now if i wanted to reapply a different liner , or i wanted to follow up with some different eye makeup , i still could. [CLS] [SEP]and i did n't have to take her eye makeup off her entire eye .i was able to just to concentrate on one area and take her eye , just her eye liner off .so that 's how you could remove your eye liner .
front side fifty-fifty on a ledge .a front side fifty-fifty is when you ollie onto a ledge .and , you grind using both of your trucks at the same time .front side is a name for when a ledge trick is done , when you approach the ledge and it 's on your front side .back side , would of course be behind you on your backside .to do the front side fifty-fifty , you 'll want to approach the ledge in a front side way .this means that the ledge is on your facing side .so , you approach the ledge and you setup in the ollie position .you 're going to want to make sure that you can ollie as high as whatever it is that you 're getting onto .and , maybe even a little bit higher .you 're going to ollie up and above what you 're getting onto .and , then direct your weight and body to a front side position .while doing a fifty-fifty in a front side position , you 're going to want to put most of your weight on your toes .this is what ends up keeping you on the ledge .and , then you keep grinding forward until your speeds run out .from that position , you 're going to have to do a small ollie to get off from the ledge and into the clear .and , be able to roll away .so , you 'll maybe while you 're grinding you can adjust your feet and setup for the ollie out .one foot on the tail and one foot just below the front bolts .and , then ollie away from it out of the fifty-fifty .and , then roll away .
in this clip , we 'll talk about hydrophobia .hydrophobia is a fear of water , and is more common than you think .it can range from being afraid to go in the ocean , to going in a pool , to the more severe level of even staying away from taking a bath .now hydrophobia a lot of times can be linked to a past trauma .for example , if when you were a child you almost drowned , or you saw someone else almost drown , that could that could be the trigger that might have led to your fear of water .so in that case , if that 's your specific trigger , you might need to talk about different ways to stay safe .you know , maybe you 're afraid of swimming because you do n't know how to swim , and some of the things you could do is as simple as learning how to swim .you know , take some swimming lessons with a certified instructor , with lifeguards on duty , and then once you learn how to swim. [CLS] [SEP], you wo n't be afraid of the water .if it stems from something , you know , a little bit more traumatic , such as seeing someone else drown , then it 's harder , because you 're talking about a trigger that you ca n't really just go and learn , and get over .what you have to do is then kind of start to view water as something different than , you know , death , or doom , or danger .and ways of doing that is again. [CLS] [SEP], you know , maybe it 's taking a class , a water class where you learn how to be comfortable with the water .maybe it 's as simple as , you know , start by , you know , filling the bathtub with a little bit of water , more than , you know , maybe up to your ankle , and being able to sit on the edge , and put your feet in .again , with hydrophobia , because of the extent of severity that it can cause , and because it 's so readily available all around us , this is probably something you want to be talking to a counselor so that they can help you work through this specific phobia .
hi , we 're here again .we are with the ar-15 rifle and we are going to go over disassembly .as we always do , you want to make sure that the rifle is safe , pointed in a safe direction as you make sure that it is unloaded by dropping the magazine out , inspecting the chamber to make sure that there 's nothing in it .right now , we 're going to take it apart .and to take this particular rifle apart , there 's two pins located on the back and the front of the rifle .all you have to do is from the reverse side , push those two pins out , and it will separate the upper receiver and the lower receiver .so , we 're going to do that right now , pushing the back pin out .we 're taking the front pin out .
today we 're going to be talking about cleaning and protecting dance shoes , point shoes , ballet shoes , you know , jazz style tap shoes , that sort of thing .we 'll start out with a , this is a basic dance shoe .what you 'd want to do with a shoe like this , it 's kind of hard because it 's a metallic .when you clean and protect a metallic shoe , you can use just a neutral polish .this is a leather shoe , or you can use a metallic polish .the metallic polishes have to be a pretty close match to look correct .you do n't want a tremendous amount of difference in the appearance of the shine between the two .when applying a polish to a shoe like that , you just rub it in. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to cover the whole area .you can use a soft cloth or a brush .i tend to use cotton most of the time for cleaning most things because it does n't leave lint and residue on the finish of the shoe .once it is dried for just a little bit , you can go back and buff those sections and using the cotton cloth or a brush .with using , colors like this , you 're probably going to want to use a cloth because if you use a black brush for polishing a shoe. [CLS] [SEP]and then you go back and try and put it on something like this , more than likely. [CLS] [SEP], you 're going to transfer color. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to show up in the shoe .so best to use a clean cloth so that you know that you 're not putting any other color back into the shoe .on point shoes that are leather , you 'd do basically the same thing .you would first clean the shoes .especially with point shoes because they contact the ground a lot and you have to remove that dirt off the shoe .so you would use a cleaner to remove the dirt and then once you 've removed that dirt on a leather shoe .you would apply a polish , whatever color would be correct or a neutral polish if you ca n't find a polish that matches .with a satin shoe , you would want to use a product like this is made for suedes , satins , nylon , canvass .you can use this on an athletic shoe , on many different materials .this is a really good cleaner .the only problem is that you have to get the entire shoe wet when applying this cleaner .you would work it in with a little brush to clean it .you can use like a soft bristle nylon brush to actually work the cleaner into the nylon .then you would take and rinse the entire shoe off and then let it dry naturally .you never want to heat a shoe when you 're drying it , so you could let it dry naturally .that 's how you would clean and protect a leather or satin dance shoe .thank you .
what you want do is make sure that on the computer with the printer you need to go into your system preferences and make sure that it ’ s actually shared so that you can print to it from other places .we need to under our system preference open up sharing .make sure that printer sharing is enabled under our services tab .what you want to do is once you ’ re on the system. [CLS] [SEP]that doesn ’ t have the printer that you need to print to. [CLS] [SEP]you need to come up and go to file and then print .when your print box comes up , you need to select your under where it says printer you need to select shared printers. [CLS] [SEP]and it ’ s going to have a list of any printers shared on your local network or any computers nearby .you select the name of the printer that ’ s on the computer. [CLS] [SEP]you just shared it from , just like this click print. [CLS] [SEP]and we ’ re done .
the weight of the rod is going to depend upon the weight of the line that we 're casting , and that is going to be determined by the size of the fly that we 're going to cast .so for instance , if we have a big bushy fly , okay , then you 're going to want a heavier line , like a six weight line that has more thickness in it , in its body to be able to turn that fly over .if you 're fishing a very , very small dry fly like the size of your fingernail , then a rod that will cast a three or a four weight line ; it 's going to cast a very little , fine fly very easily .now , to expand on that , is like a six weight line , which is large diameter ; it will very easily cast a small fly the size of your fingernail , though the presentation or how it fishes will not be quite as nice , okay ; whereas , if you take a small diameter three or four weight line , it will not be able to push a big , bushy fly through the air because there 's more mass to it .in other words , to to for that to be able to happen is when you start out , you get a rod that matches the line weight that you , and the size of the flies that you 're planning on fishing , so what what it starts out to is the rod manufacturer will have written on the rod four weight rod , and then , so you start out trying to put a four weight line on it .now , the next thing we want to talk about is the weight of the rod .so the weight of the rod , that 's going to be go in hand with the balance of how the reel , when you hold the rod by the handle , how comfortable it feels to you .is the tip heavy ?is it the reel. [CLS] [SEP]cause it to tip back ?you want to have it. [CLS] [SEP]so when you grip it comfortably with your hand it feels comfortable , so weight is going to have a big factor , especially in reference to your body size .so , if you have smaller wrists or whatever , then you do n't want to have a rod that weighs a lot .you want to have a rod that 's comfortable .a lighter rod will always be easier to cast , and you 'll be able to fish longer during the day .
so right now i 'm going to do two or three hundred yards warm-up swim .and so then the next part of the warm-up is usually a couple hundred yards of kicking .with the warm-up portion of your swim do n't be afraid to include some different strokes .even though in a triathlon you only use the front crawl , in the interest of varying your training and working on rotation , it 's a good idea to include some backstroke and even some breast stroke for flexibility .kick for the triathlon is something that you need to pay attention to because you need a short , shallow kick .once you put on your wet suit , your legs are going to float real high in the water and to expend a lot of energy to kick would be very detrimental to the bike and run legs .so , work on just a short , shallow , steady kick .
we are going to show you how to dance the hustle .now we are going to show you the sent out from the closed position .you want to remember , the leader is now starting with the side break .while the follower is doing a back break .we will show you the pattern first .one , two three and one bring back into the close position .to make sure that you can catch onto the foot work .the leader will show you the first of the foot work .side break cross together back. [CLS] [SEP]break turn close .again side break turn together back break turn close .quarter turn to the left and quarter turn to the right .the follower will be doing a pivot with two walks .back break pivot walk starting with a back break step turn back in .we will show you this one more time .back break turn walk out back break step in .
all right .so beat three. [CLS] [SEP], we have our downbeat , and then our `` e '' right at the second sixteenth note .and then our left foot is coming down on the upbeat. [CLS] [SEP]but that 's not really a note. [CLS] [SEP], that 's kind more of a rest just because it 's closing that hi-hat lift .so you actually have a rest on the upbeat , and then you have the cross stick come back in on the uh of three .so , three-e & uh , okay ?so , just beat three sounds like : three , four , one , two .three , four .one , two , okay ?so. [CLS] [SEP]bah-uh-uh , three-e , uh , three-e , uh , okay ?and that syncopation is going to kind of continue into beat four where we have like kind of a kick pick up into the cross stick .take at look at the next clip there .
so we 're going to talk a little bit about stretches that you can do with your horse that will help to compliment the other body work that you are doing that can be part of your horse 's total exercise fitness program .we will talk about doing stretches that will stretch the horse 's neck and top line area .stretches that you can do with the forelegs .stretches that can help with your horse 's abdominals as well as the back area and stretches that are going to help loosen up the horse 's hamstring area , their hind legs .just make them feel a little bit more comfortable all the way around .you need to make sure that when you are doing the stretches on your horse you never want to do them on a horse that is cold .you want to make sure that you 've warmed your horse up first even if it 's just something as simple as a little walk around your yard or something like that .get those muscles loosened up and do n't try to over stretch your horse , if they start to show resistance to what you are doing , you need to back off , if you force the stretch you will probably hurt your horse .
okay , now we 're going to connect this back in .just always start it by hand .if there 's a resistance there 's a problem .do n't just go ahead and force it .and just snug it up slightly .okay , now let me slide over here. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'll grab the air filter .and get that into place .make sure it fits just right , like so .and we 'll go ahead and start to tighten it down .there 's a gasket around this -- a foam gasket that you can to make sure is all in , and nothing hanging over deforming it .just a firm believer in taking care of your equipment , and it will take care of you .do n't be afraid to snug that up .you do n't want that vibrating loose on you .okay , continuing on .take this cover and we 're going to place it in here .boy , i love it when the plan comes together like that .it does n't always just snap in place like that .then you 're going to take. [CLS] [SEP]-- we 've got all these snaps -- we 're going to go ahead and snap them .there 's one in the back .got three on this side , and then we 've got one up front .the one up front you 're not going to be able to see , because i can barely see it ,so i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]sure the camera wo n't be able to .but i will lock it into place .just like that .okay , next we 'll take and hook up this sensor that we had taken off before .we just push this on .okay , now i took this out of my pocket where i had it for safe keeping , but this clip goes on here to keep it safe , so we 'll snap that into place , and that takes care of that .
in this clip , we 're going to be doing the pendulum swing with the exercuff .so you want to come down slowly on the mat .if you do n't already have your excercuffs on , you might want to put them on at this point .okay .come down to the prone position on the mat .there are a number of options .you can have your palms down on the mat or you can come down on to your forearms .okay .now we are going to take our rear leg , extend pass the opposite leg and swing it across .so you are going to be touching down on two different points .touching down passed the opposite leg and then across .you can make this fast or slow .you just want to watch your back and keep your back nice and stable. [CLS] [SEP]so you do n't provide any additional stress .you are going to feel this all through the gluts , the quads , the hams , the calves and you are also going to feel in in the obliques , low back and the hip flexors .it 's very important to have these cuffs nice and secure. [CLS] [SEP]so you have a nice smooth movement .
and if you travel to any of these cities on an evening out , you might find yourself in a spanish restaurant where part of the activity for the evening will be a flamenco show .what makes flamenco particularly interesting is the influences of other dance forms that have helped to create it .we know that the earliest settlers in andalucia , came , not only from the middle east and from north africa , and besides the persians , the moors and the arabs , there was a strong immigration of people who came in from the north of india. [CLS] [SEP]and we call them the gypsies .
before you head out for a long distance road trip the first thing you should do is go over everything inside of your engine bay and make sure all the fluid levels are appropriate .check your coolant level , your air conditioning , your washer fluid for your windows , your power steering fluid , and check your engine oil and see if it is the proper level or if it needs to be changed .also , check your brake fluid , cause ' you do n't want to lose your brakes while you 're drivin ' .and if you have a hydraulic clutch or a stick car the cylinder 'll be somewhere in this area ; near the brake .also , check the spark plug wires and the boots to make sure they 're not burnt , and make sure they 're not old , worn , or cracked .and also , check your battery connection terminals and make sure they 're secured , cause ' a loose connection will make it so you 'll lose power .check your air filter , and also check your transmission fluid which should be located right in the back of the engine compartment if you have a rear wheel drive car , and a front wheel drive car should also be somewhere around here ; near the transmission area .so , before you go on a road trip just check all your fluids , check your spark plug wires , and make sure everything 's all in working order and all the levels are good , and all the fluids are at a high quality .
next step once you have your ridge pole cut out , and you have your wide stick ready to go , like i showed you earlier , notch it in there , lock it in .now lay inside here .and the reason you want to lay down in here , before you go any further with this debris hut , just make sure you fit. [CLS] [SEP], there 's sometimes-this is a pretty nice fit here .i can see this .sometimes people make debris huts where they can fit two or three people inside , and you do n't want that .if you 're by yourself , build it for yourself .because the more air you have inside your debris hut , the more you 're going to have to try to get the hut warmed up ,so .okay , you can see the way i 'm laying. [CLS] [SEP], legs extended all the way , heads down , i 'm pretty comfortable .and i have enough room that once this is built , i 'll be pretty comfortable , i 'll be able to move around .it 's very important that you do n't have this huge dome in front of you that has to be heated up , so ,i 'm pretty content with this .so let 's go to the next step .
i moved out here seven years ago from osaka , japan .i studied linguistics when i was in college , and i 've been tutoring from students to adults who are travelling to japan , and i 've been working as a translator .and i hope you learn some japanese and start using it .and in the previous show , we learned how to greet in japanese and also we learned some very useful sentences , which you can use in japan .and in this show , i want you to learn how to describe about you and about the person and about your surroundings .i hope you enjoy this show , and let 's start .
let 's take a look .on the introductory riff , we 're going to start with our index finger on the 5th fret of the a string .then we 're going to put our ring finger. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to keep it hovered over the 7th fret of the same string because we 're going to bring it down here. [CLS] [SEP], okay ?now , the riff sounds like it 's counted as in one-two-three , one-two-three , one-two-three , one-two , when in actuality , you 're counting sets of four .as you go through the riff , i want you to count out loud. [CLS] [SEP]so you keep proper rhythm , okay ?one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four .you see how -- where my fingers were landing as i was doing that ?on the certain particular -- the quarter notes as i was counting them out .make sure you follow that and keep the rhythm right ,okay ?we 'll do that again .one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four .pay attention on that .it 's kind of important .to speed , the introduction sounds like this .if you count while you play it to speed , it sounds like this .one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four .pay attention. [CLS] [SEP], that 's a pretty fast way to count it ,okay ?in our next segment , we 're going to continue `` ca n't stop '' with the riff that 's played under the verse .i 'll see you in that segment .
let 's take a closer look at our , where we are going to turn a tenon in other words this gripping spigot here in our chuck .now that is going to go down inside that and what we need to do is measure. [CLS] [SEP]that across here .i 've already got that set. [CLS] [SEP]so i 've got my calipers set there .now on these chuck jaws they are actually dove tailed on both sides. [CLS] [SEP]so i need to have a bit of a dove tail if you can see it right there that will match that. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to do that with the skew and. [CLS] [SEP]while i have got you right here you can see how i am going to cut that .i 'm going to cut that just like that and that will match that chuck and give me a good secure place .now i can take this. [CLS] [SEP]and i have rough cut this. [CLS] [SEP]and it looks pretty good. [CLS] [SEP]so i just need to take that. [CLS] [SEP]and now i am going to use my skew and true that up a big .i need to true this face up here too. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'll true the tenon up. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll be ready to do some more finishing cuts out here .
just regular oats like oatmeal and just put that in there and mix it .blend it .next we are going to get the cinnamon. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to add 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and always level it off .1 tablespoon of cinnamon .
i 'll add that and as well as the feta and mint to top the salad which looks and smells delicious .
this cocktail is called lugger .go ahead and start off by putting your ice and your mixing glass like so .then we are going to do one ounce of apple brandy , one ounce of apple brandy. [CLS] [SEP], let 's see , there we go .i got lost there for a second .now we are going to do one ounce of regular brandy , get in there. [CLS] [SEP]and then one ounce of apricot brandy like so .now mix them together .so i must say if you like brandy. [CLS] [SEP]then the lugger is for you , equal parts of apple brandy , brandy , and apricot brandy .now we are going to go ahead and get a martini , like a cocktail glass out and strain the lugger on in .that is what it is going to look like , a nice little three ounce drink there for you. [CLS] [SEP]and you are good to go , cheers .
you want to open up the lymph nodes .you take that strap , again it 's not stretchy. [CLS] [SEP]it 's firm , over your right shoulder for the right side .and take your left hand in your lower back and then bring that strap right up with your hand and set the hand on top of your head .position the elbows outward , so the top elbow goes back and the lower elbow goes out .and then take that left hand and just edge it up your back and take the right hand and edge it down .so you 're trying to connect both hands closer together .sit up straight and tall so your shoulders are right back , your chin is level , and take a deep breath in through your nose .exhale through your nose , edge that a little bit deeper .and another deep breath in , feeling that right arm go right back and the left shoulder go right back .inhale deep and then exhale , and then release .and as you release that , just turn to the other side so you can switch .take that strap in your left hand and your right hand goes to lower back .your feet can go in front of you , they can sit cross ,whatever is more comfortable for you .and set that hand on the top of your head and the other hand on the lower back .reaching up and reaching down , you can reach that hand closer together both sides .but keep that left shoulder right back .keep the shoulders back , the chin high , and the top of the head lifted .and breathe in deep through your nose , and exhale .another deep breath in , exhale .each breath today , i want you to bring those hands a little bit closer together .breathe in deep through your nose , and exhale .and then release that .release that to shake it right off .
in this clip i 'm going to be demonstrating a 6 stroke roll .a 6 stroke roll is as it implies 6 hits ; 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 . [CLS] [SEP]1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6.so i 'll be doing a drum beat. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'll do it slow. [CLS] [SEP]so you can kind of pick up on the actual 6 hits that i 'm doing , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6.see if you can count the hits as i 'm doing them throughout the roll .that was a 6 stroke roll .have fun with it .
front side nose slide on a ledge .front side nose slide means that you 're going to do a nose slide. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to approach the ledge with the ledge on your front side .so this means while you 're actually sliding in a nose slide you 're going to be a little bit blind side. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're not going to see what direction you 're headed in .so the name front side just means the direction that the ledge is approaching not the way that you ’ re sliding .so for in front side nose slide what you 're going to want to do is approach the ledge front side and ali into a front side nose slide position .in front side nose slide you 're going to notice that you 're going to have to be a little bit twisted .one thing you 're going to want to do is keep your eyes in the direction that you 're headed .so you ali into a front side nose slide and you 're going to slide this way. [CLS] [SEP]and when you get to the end of the ledge you 're going to want to pop out and roll away straight .so this again is ali into a front side nose slide position and then pop out and roll away forward .
now i have my other side of my scarf all decorated the way i want it .and i 've done one more thing .which is , i 've put my two layers of bubble wrap together on the same side .the trick to this is to have your bubble wrap with the flat sides together and when you roll everything up. [CLS] [SEP]it 's much easier than trying to roll the two layers of bubble wrap with the wool in the middle .what i need to do next is add dish soap .my handy dandy dish soap dispenser .a little bit goes a long way. [CLS] [SEP]so you do not need a whole lot of soap .if you get too much though you can always rinse it out .if you do n't have enough. [CLS] [SEP]your wool will not want to stick together because it wont be wetted properly so when in doubt a little bit more .but you can see i 've just kind of dribbled a little bit over here. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's going to be plenty .and i 've got hot water here .it 's easier to work over your sink and you can use your little sprayer. [CLS] [SEP]but in this case we do n't have that luxury. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm just going to pour my hot water over here .everything is going to get rearranged a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]but .now i want to roll everything up in the bubble wrap .so i 'm going to start at one end .you can put a piece of foam in here .like a pool noodle if you have one .but i 'm just going to roll it all up and make sure that it 's fairly tight and if i have too much water. [CLS] [SEP]it 's going to run out the sides .if i do n't have enough i can always unroll it and add some more .and then i 'm going to take my roll and just to help it stay together. [CLS] [SEP]i 've got some knee high pantyhose. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to tie those around to hold it shut just like that .
in virabhadrasana or the warrior one pose , one of the things , that i notice when i 'm teaching , is a lot of people using their arms incorrectly .we often see rounded arms or just sloppy arms .an important part of this pose is to get the energetic flow lengthening up toward the sky .in order to do this , you have to use the arms properly .i will now ask faith , my assistant , to come into warrior one pose for us .first , she will bring her right foot forward and bending through her right knee .she will shoot her right knee forward toward the front edge of the mat .notice how her knee stays in line and not in or out to the side .we are going to square faith 's hips , so that she is not in warrior one and one half , with her hips over to the side nor warrior two .she is in warrior one with full hips to the center .she is pressing in , to the little toe , to the heel and to the back left foot .this will activate the energy on the outside of the leg .inhaling , she will fully extend both arms over her head .to make sure that we do n't have sloppy arms , i 'll have faith grab this block and press her hands in on each side of the block .this allows her to engage her biceps and her triceps .in this pose her biceps are up near her ears .inhale and lengthen , just a little bit .exhale and sink a little bit more and perhaps take her extended arms back just a tad more .if she can she should take her arms back just beyond her ear .using the block can help bring your arms into proper alignment .
hi this elise mcmahon for expert village in this video series we are going to be talking living in a multi dog household .
okay , so now i 've got my pattern all cut out .here it is , like a little jig-saw puzzle on the table .i 've got it assembled correctly , right , because i numbered it ahead of time .one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fourteen .i could have numbered it anyway. [CLS] [SEP]i want .but , something else i did .i did it off camera. [CLS] [SEP], you did n't see me do it , is i drew a little plan , a little sketch , just to remind myself how they all go together .because remember , you really have to put it back together .you have to cut the pieces to the pattern and put it back together the same way the pattern was cut , if you want it to fit together because , even though a lot of these pieces are the same shape , approximately , if you mix them up you can sometimes find that things do n't fit like you think they are going to .alright , so we got it all cut .now , let me just kind of go generally through the basics of what we are going to do. [CLS] [SEP]and then we will go through it step by step .so , for example i have decided that pieces number three and six , these two rectangles , are going to be blue .so here 's my piece of blue .so , basically what i am going to do. [CLS] [SEP], you will see this in future clips , is i am going to take these pieces one at a time .and remember , i cut on the outsides of the sharpie line. [CLS] [SEP]so that , for a little bit of allowance for the tape and the solder .so you can see that a lot of these internal sharpie lines are gone. [CLS] [SEP], they 've been cut away , so that 's good .but , i am going to take a piece of the pattern. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to lay it on the glass one way or the other , it does n't really matter .i 'm going to mark the glass with either a sharpie or a permanent pen if it is a light colored glass .this is a darker colored glass. [CLS] [SEP]so i might want to use a grease based , like china marker .i just have kind of a white oil pastel here which will show it up on dark glass .then i cut the glass , and i do that with every piece .and once i have all those pieces of glass then i can begin assembling .so , in the next clip we will talk about setting up a piece of glass for cutting .
so even though we just talked about how this space has a lot of challenges in terms of storage , there is actually a lot of potential for adding storage in here .the greatest potential probably comes from the refrigerator .refrigerators since they are magnetic there are a lot of storage options for actually putting magnets on your refrigerator that hold herbs or utensils that kind of thing .the top of the refrigerator always good for storage .there are a couple of different options that i 'll get into later to create storage using these , these shelves thingies and then also the biggest thing that 's working over here for me anyway is the window .so i 've got a lot of light over here and also this space , even though it is a small space .i can choose what i put in there , so there are a lot of options of things that i can put in there .
cindy mastry :gomukasana or cow face pose is a really great pose to release tension through the hips .faith is going to demonstrate how to do the lower half. [CLS] [SEP], lower body of cow face pose .if you have tight hips , it can help to have a seat on the block .so we 're going to ask faith to take a seat on the block .good .and then she 's going to try to bring her right knee over her left knee .good , yes .and take her toes out to the side .so what you want to do is try to line your knees up , so one knee sits on top of the other knee .good .she wants to take her feet out to the side as much as she can and flex her feet .good .the block just elevates you up just enough so that your knees can float forward a little bit more easily and gently .she then wants to lengthen up through the crown of her head , inhaling , lengthening up and exhaling .if she likes , she can take her hands down and come forward just a little bit .that 's going to put just a little bit more pressure into the hips. [CLS] [SEP]so she can release a little bit more tension , relieve any low back pain , a tight spine .good .inhale , breathing your spine long , coming back up , and exhale , releasing .
the proper way to set up is to have the mike behind the speaker .another thing is you want to provide some distance between the speaker and the people in the front row because you do n't want the sound to overwhelm them .for the mixer , a bad set up i commonly see is having the mixer behind the speakers .in this position you ca n't hear what the audience hears .and you may not even be able to hear if a speaker fails .another thing is you 're a distraction in this position because you 're in the sight line of the audience .from this position if you want to hear both speakers you 're going to have to move in front of them which again is distracting to the audience .a good set up for the mixer is where you can hear both speakers simultaneously .and the best place for this is in the back of the room at the center .so that covers where you should place your speakers and your mixer .
i 'm beau timken , master sake sommelier .and we 're speaking about daiginjos in this segment .specifically we 're talking about ,hey , how can i taste daiginjo and when is it available in the united states ?i 've picked three brews ,by no means are we limited to three sakes .there are , i would say , are more than two hundred and fifty daiginjos to choose from .but i picked these three because they all specialize in certain different capacities .the first is a very famous wakatake the onigroroshi , the demon slayer from shizoka prefecture .great people , great brewery and. [CLS] [SEP]truly it is the number one imported daiginjo that comes to the united states , available really almost everywhere .the demon slayer , good fruit , good acidity .this is one of those brews when you drink it and your like , oh my god , how can rice and water taste like this ?like cantaloupe , really fruit forward , good acidity blend .then next from fushimi , from right outside kyoto is a very famous brewery called tamanohikari .this brewery , they specialize in junmai sake , meaning they only make sakes with just rice and water .they do n't add distilled alcohol ever to any of their sakes .their daiginjo is a really a great good full body drinking experience , has a high acidity .typically sake has one third the acidity of wine .this guy they put out is pretty good acidity level , that really compliments , believe it or not , cheeses , if you ever want to do a cheese plate .when i go to taste these at this brewery , they always with their sake will have bleu cheese .so , think outside the box , sake going with bleu cheese , no way .now one of the prides that come over , that restaurants love saying , we pour , is the kubota , the manju .this is a brew from nigata prefecture , the kubota brewery , asahisujo .this brew uses rice that they mill to thirty three percent .they take off sixty seven percent of each grain of rice .it 's super milled , super polished. [CLS] [SEP]and it is truly one of the most dynamic brews in the business .it has great name recognition and great brand recognition , and when you see like a glass for twenty dollars on a menu , more often or not it 's probably going to be something like the kubota , the daiginjo .
and we 're going to roll out a thin log .and this is probably the easiest thing you 'll ever sculpt because a butterfly body is pretty easy. [CLS] [SEP]it 's just a thin little strip of clay .and you can measure it. [CLS] [SEP], you do n't want to make it too big .if you want to make the head you can fold over a piece like this and make the head. [CLS] [SEP]so you get this kind of shape .what we 're going to do is we 're going to take our poker. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to cross-hatch our butterfly wings and add some glue .and then we 're going to attach the butterfly body .they have these kind of grooves across their body. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's actually grooves .we 're going to make some grooves across the body like this .then we 're going to take two gems. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to make sure you 're using gems that have a have a diamond back .then you 're going to take your poker. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to poke two eye holes .and then you 're going to pick up the gem with your finger. [CLS] [SEP]and you should have enough natural oils on your finger to pick up the gem. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to put it right in the hole .
good , now we 're ready to cut a slot from this mark to this mark .it 's going to be 1/2 inch wide and. [CLS] [SEP]1/4 of an inch deep .so i get my router. [CLS] [SEP]and i 've already set my router up with 1/2 inch straight bit .now in my case i happen to have a plunge router. [CLS] [SEP]but if you do n't have a plunge router , i 'll show you in a second how to do this with a regular round router .i 'm going to set the router down with the center of the blade right on that line , if you can see it .can the camera see that ?we 're going to put that down right in the center of that line .we 'll get that nice and straight and for that we 'll use our long square and lay the square up like this right along that edge , get in the center and using our flat chiseled pencil , draw a line like that .take the router off. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to set up a stop this is to butt the router up against and draw the flat edge of my router along this fence right here , this little strip. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm setting up that i 'm going to clamp down and that will hold it the correct distance away from this line while we cut this slot .looks like it is lined up pretty good .this is very very critical however to make sure that this piece of wood that i 'm putting on this is right on that line .it has got to be right there otherwise when you cut the slot the slot may go up or down if this is twisted , your router is not going to make a straight line and this piece may not be able to slide back and forth on the table. [CLS] [SEP]so this is real critical to get this line straight .i have my strip set up .now i 'm going to take a couple of clamps. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to clamp the strip , the piece of stock together to the table .hold it down steady and when you put the clamp on its ok if the clamp sticks over this strip a little bit because my router has a clearance here. [CLS] [SEP]and so it wo n't hit it .and now we 'll set the other clamp .
in this step , we 're going to take a look at how to use the wire brushes on the cymbals .and we 're going to take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of using the wire brushes on the cymbals .now first , let 's just hear how they sound .and on the ride .okay , that 's how wire brushes sound just hitting the cymbal regularly .some advantages is if we 're going to do a cymbal roll , kind of can give you a unique type of texture .as you can see , the cymbal 's not really ringing much , but you 're still getting that sheen of the cymbal .and that 's probably the real ,i guess advantage to using the wire brush on the cymbal , because they are quiet , so it 's hard to hear -- if you 're playing a beat .i mean ,i 'm hitting it pretty hard. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're just not getting that nice little attack that you get with a regular drumstick where you can actually hear the cymbal speak a little bit .the other disadvantage is you ca n't , without that little attack , you do n't get to use as much of the cymbal as you would with a regular drumstick .so the bell does n't quite sound as cool as it does , so. [CLS] [SEP]you 're kind of limited in that way .one solution is you can actually flip over the brush , which is actually quite hard to do because you 're holding the wires .but if you 're playing light , you can actually use this ring .and that gives you that little attack. [CLS] [SEP]you need that you were missing by using the wire brushes .the other cool thing about using the ring , is you can do like little cymbal pools .and that 's just a nice little -- and this one does n't work as well , because as you can see the cymbal does n't have as good of grooves in it , so it 's kind of harder to do .but this one , the ride cymbal , just a little , it gives you a little orchestral flavor to it .and that can add some color to whatever piece of music you are playing .so there are some of the advantages and disadvantages of using wire brushes with the cymbals .
so while i 'm making my decision about my piece to work on , again , within the same idea and context of what i was working within this piece , i am choosing to just border off certain specific areas of collaging .so here you can see i 've sort of chosen these egg like shapes which are a little bit harder to work with as you have to sort of rip off smaller pieces of tape in order to border off the edges .but they are a little more interesting of a shape to work with rather than a standard square .so you can see how i 've sort of worked the shape and the direction of all the materials inside of those shapes in order to work with that .but then for this piece that i 'm working with today , i 've chosen to do just one box frame , and i want to make sure that my box frame is some. [CLS] [SEP]what compositionally. [CLS] [SEP], i do n't know , pleasing for me or to the eye as to where i 'm going to be actually doing my collage work in , and where i will be painting .so it 's sort of a distinction between the two .
be in the moment !what do i mean by that ?well i remember one time i was doing a casting for a huge project and an actress came in and said , `` oh my gosh. [CLS] [SEP]i hope i get this ''and i said. [CLS] [SEP]yeah , why ?well then i can pay off my visa bill and i can make my car payment .i said , woo woo , woo , woo , be in the moment of the audition !you see , if you 're thinking about something in the future or if you 're thinking about something in the past , then you can not possibly be in the moment of the audition .if you 're not in the moment of the audition you 're going to loose the audition , i do n't want that to happen .
we are going to start with a warm up that i like to do .my coach at the university pretty much showed me how to do this , but it 's very basic .it 's basically run a little , slow do n't start too hard .i like to come here to the line , come back here .now , what i 'm going to do is do a warm up on the side .lateral movement is very important on tennis court .so , we 're going to start warming up for that .basically what we do ; we stay on our toes , we move laterally , and we just kind of jump in our toes .so , let me start that over. [CLS] [SEP]and then i come back .ok .
okay so now i 'm going to use another toner out here today .i 'm going to use some good old coffee .i made a big rather strong pot of coffee that i am going to tone some prints in .right now , i 'm going to take some cyanotypes and tone them in the coffee .i have two which i am just going to let sit .and i just want them to get covered all the way .now just like the tea that we had done earlier , it takes a little while .but i can already see how the coffee is hitting in this paper. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's making it what they call veining .here and here , and here .and again it makes these prints look much older than they are .and i 'm going to take an rc , not an rc print , excuse me .a fiber based print next , and we 're going to see what it does .but right now these cyanotypes are really taking up rather quickly .i really see in here , it 's reacting with the paper in a way that it 's really making it look like it 's been around forever .
ok.when it comes to action , which is the string height above the frets .there are a whole bunch of variables that effect that action .one of them is the straightness of the neck .second variable is the neck pitch angle .that 's the angle of the neck relative to the body .third variable is the height of the nut .the fourth variable is the height of the saddles , right here .the saddle position also effects the action .forward and backwards as well as how well it ?s sitting in the guitar body .the fret heights is another one of the variables that effects the action .that 's the height of the frets .frets come in various different size heights .some people like high frets .other people like low frets .low frets are good for fast action guitars .high frets are favored by players that like the older vintage style instruments .the nut slot radius is another factor .that 's the size of the nut slot .as well as the nut slot depth as another variable .and the last variable is the type of bridge and the attachment of this kind of bridge or the kind of bridge that it has to the instrument .this happens to be a whammy bar kind of bridge like on a stratocaster .this other instrument has a fixed type bridge .and sometimes these bridges can be loose or not tightened down tight enough , so they slop around a little bit .and so those are the variables that affect the height of the strings above the frets which we know as action .
my name 's alex. [CLS] [SEP]and i am an entry level engineer at weber elliot engineers in eugene , oregon .and i 'm going to tell you about how i got my first job as an entry level engineer .and you 're only ever entry level engineer once. [CLS] [SEP]so this is also my first job this way .the story i have is probably a little unique .i got a math degree at the university of oregon and instead of going straight into an engineering internship i went and got a lot of other work experience .i worked with youth , i worked in an office. [CLS] [SEP]and i worked in retail .all these different things and built up my resume for a couple of years .and then decided that engineering was something i 'd be interested in. [CLS] [SEP]so i pulled together my resume and basically sat down and telephoned a whole bunch of engineering firms in town and just asked them directly if they had internships and in this manner i men jerry over the phone and jerry ,who co-owns this company actually had need of any intern .he had n't even advertised the position. [CLS] [SEP]but i got lucky. [CLS] [SEP]and he said sure send me your resume .i emailed him my resume and he looked at my resume .he called my back , he set up an interview and the interview went well. [CLS] [SEP]so i got the job .and so that 's my story .that 's how i got my first job .
in this clip , i 'm going to talk a bit about what i 'm wearing .some of the costumes , this is some of the traditional wear that you will see african dancers and drummers wear .the beads that are adorning my bra right here are actually cowrie shells and they are very popular in different parts of west africa , many years ago , they used to be used as currency , or money .not used as money today but used as beautiful jewelry and things to go on costumes .also , this is from senegal , and this is raffia , it is a colored raffia , a different kind of raffia .most raffia you 're going to see is going to be brown. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's traditionally used as grass skirts .so it 's not in the same fashion of hawaiian grass skirts , but they call it raffia , but it is very similar .again , what we also will wear are beads and bells on our feet so. [CLS] [SEP]as we dance it makes noise , king-king-king-king-king-king-king , king-king-king-king-king , king-king-king .
we formed the rice cakes but we 're not going to cook them right now because our chicken is going to take just a little bit longer .so we 've taken our chicken which is marinated , we 're making sure that everything is still covering the chicken .then we are going to go and turn our front burner on up to about six. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to heat a tablespoon of oil .while we 're waiting , for the oil to heat up , i 'm going to go ahead and cut up another two cloves of garlic .we 're going to be sauteing the chicken in this .so we 're going to remove our brown ends .we 're going to discard them because we 're going to cut them as big as they were. [CLS] [SEP]so we do n't want them to get all mixed up .clean the knife , chop our garlic once more and we 're going to add it to our pan .we 're going to move our oil around. [CLS] [SEP]so it covers all the bottom of the pan and we 're going to flip our chicken over , making sure that all of these flavors are incorporated on both sides .then we 're going to add it straight to the pan .we 're going to reserve this juice we 're going to be adding a little bit of it for the flavor. [CLS] [SEP]but we 're not going to dump the whole thing in .
now i am going to demonstrate how to do astral posture in leg region .so very simple , not difficult .comfortable way , your leg stretch , both leg stretch , and your hands be comfortable ,your hand is free , not to any specific reason you support , you feel comfortable your hand in the back side so you can support with your hand and after your close your feet .and inhaling is very important .in the feet area you concentrate this astral postures in the toes area , inhaling your own fingers , inhale and hold , exhale toes down , inhale toes up , exhale toes down , inhale toes up , exhale toes down , inhale toes up , exhale toes down .full stretch. [CLS] [SEP]your feet , inhale , exhale , inhale , full stretch feet hold , exhale down , inhale up , hold , exhale and relax .clockwise normal move , clockwise move your feet three time , anti three time , breath normal , after relax .in the feet region , in pure energy clean out or generate the pure energy in the feet region and heal your feet region very well through this astral postures .
so here we 're going to start talking about the four ball half shower .now this is significantly different than any of the other four ball tricks we 've talked about so far in that each throw is going to cross hands .you 're not going to be throwing right to. [CLS] [SEP]right anymore , you 're going to be throwing right to left , and left to right .now , this is also going to be significantly different because you 're going to have to throw at two different heights .you 're going to have to throw a five height out of your right hand , and a three hand out of your left .remember the numbers correspond to the length of time each balls in the air .if you want to go back and look at side swaps , there are a lot of good articles online an. [CLS] [SEP]i had an intro video. [CLS] [SEP]a couple of videos ago talking about what side swaps are and how to talk about them .but anyways , the four ball half shower is technically a side swap 53.that is your throwing a five out of your right hand and a three out of your left .so if you switch from the four , which is side swap four , into the half shower , something like that .now this is not quite the half shower .if you actually want to execute the half shower , the five throw should be thrown from the outside of your pattern crossing over the top to the inside .so something like this .so this is. [CLS] [SEP]the async four ball half shower .now , this takes a little bit of practice splitting your vision , but it 's really just throwing it high , then throwing a low and both crossing .it 's also pretty common to do it unison , in which case both throws will be the same height .something like this .hopefully you do n't collide like that .this pattern is also often called wimpy which we talked about a little bit earlier , but making sure that your right handed throw is always on top of the left .that 's. [CLS] [SEP]the four ball half shower .
now the the zeppelin bend starts into a series of a family of knots that uses the overhand bend .now , a bend is a way of tying two ropes together and so you can actually loosen them up , so the cords do n't bind .because in the old days , cords were very , very rare , and it 's something that you really wanted to keep .so what we 're going to do here is i have two ropes here to demonstrate my zeppelin bend .what i 'm going to is i 'm going to take these two ropes .and in my hand , do it like this , i 'm going to create a loop with both of them .now-oh , i 'm sorry .let 's just do it like this .let 's create a bend like this .and we 'll just start with one .and what we 're going to do is we 're going to wrap it around both and create just a single overhand knot such as this .as you can see here , just in the red line , just a simple overhand knot .now , what we 're going to do is , we 're going to take the standing end of my blue rope and pull it over .what we 're going to do is we 're going to wrap this around like this and create a overhand bend as it loops through both of them again .as you can see , both of them have looped through each other , to create two overhand bends in separate knots .so what we 're going to do is we 're just going to pull these together. [CLS] [SEP], we 'll tighten them up , pulling both sides together .might be simpler if i start with my working end , my standing end , working end , standing end .and there we go .now the best way to show this knot is to make sure that all the knots come out in a ninety degree .and there you go ; you can see this is a nice zeppelin bend .and easy to pull out of your rope .
i mean if this really were fitzcarraldo from the werner herzog film he would have a nice little white suit , kind of a black narrow tie .there is that fedora .it might be hard to make a fedora for a sock monkey .but still , but you can do whatever you want .you can make vests , skirts , hats .hats are optional .but you could put buttons on him ; i have got all kinds of buttons here .you could i mean shoot. [CLS] [SEP]i guess you could even if you wanted to. [CLS] [SEP]i guess you could may be use buttons for nostrils .i do n't think i would like that too much .but you could do it if you liked .green button nostrils .a lot of sock monkey artists will use embroidery thread .i have a bunch of colors here to do things like eyelashes .you know stitch some little nostrils .you could even define the lips a little better .you know make kind of sort of sweetheart like plump lips and maybe do a little line across them and kind of a smiley face .so you are really just kind of limited by your imagination .when my mom made sock monkeys for me when i was little she put hair on them .but she did it individual strands of embroidery thread just knotted. [CLS] [SEP]and then before she sewed it together like this. [CLS] [SEP]she did it from the inside .so there were all these little strands of yellow embroidery thread coming out like this one by one knotted on the inside .so you can really do it any way you want .so there you go .fitzcarraoldo the sock monkey .
in a slightly steeper and more technical trail , like the one i just rode with the rocks and roots in it , you can see that my upper body was higher and rotated back .instead of being really low and over the front , i 'm still aggressive and attacking the trail , but. [CLS] [SEP]i moved my weight back a little bit .especially with the lack of suspension that i have up front .if all my weight was really low and forward , every time i hit a root or a rock , it would want to slow me down a little bit too much .by a little bit too much , i mean throw me off the bike .a little bit smoother , a little bit higher , lower , further back .my ice cream cone instead of being like this , a little bit more , lowered it , moved it back a little bit just to keep the center off mass in a more appropriate place .it 's finding this delicate balance .on every different type of trail , you want to do different things with your body placement , the way that you use your brakes , and everything else to maintain the control .
so if you want to change your stock stem out for something different. [CLS] [SEP], first thing is you need to know what type of stem you need to get .stems come in length. [CLS] [SEP]between thirty-five and a hundred thirty-five millimeters .most people use stems in the fifty to a hundred and twenty millimeter range .your stock bike is about a hundred ten millimeters , about this length .most people end up going to shorter stems for fashion reasons really more than anything .the other thing to remember is what diameter steer tube you have , if it 's inch and an eighth , or inch and a half .this bike is inch and an eighth .you can tell because it 's smaller than inch and a half .the other thing , and this can get people out sometimes , is the diameter of your handlebars .recently , more and more companies are using a thirty-one point eight millimeter diameter handlebar , whereas , in the past , they 've been using a twenty-five point four handlebar .you can see there 's a big difference here .this is a twenty-five four bar , this is a thirty-one eight stem .this stem is fully closed up , and i can slide it right over .so , obviously there is a difference .so , let me show you how we 're going to take this thing apart .we 've got five millimeter bolts here that hold the face plate on .we 've got five millimeter bolts here that hold the actual stem on .and then this preload bolt is a four mil .so , i 'm going to start by taking out the preload bolt .this is easier to do when i 've got everything on there .and remember , that 's just keeping your headset adjustment .so .then , second step is going to be loosening up the bolts that keep my headset adjusted and keep my stem in place .so now they 're loose , and you can see how loose they were because just decided to pop out .so i 'm going to just tighten up this bottom bolt a little bit , just to keep everything in place .and then , it 's a simple matter of one , two , three , four bolts .and notice how i loosened those in a nice , consistent little pattern .so .just spin them out .so .try not to lose any of my bolts .and pop it out .loosen this last bolt .and got our stem off .
the other thing that i forgot to cover is the tire sealant .now what this does right here is say if you were riding down the highway and you had a small obstruction. [CLS] [SEP]like i just fixed. [CLS] [SEP]but you did n't have the time or the tools to do it. [CLS] [SEP]you could go to any one of your auto parts stores and get a form of tire sealant .now what this does it is just a quick fix. [CLS] [SEP]so i would not suggest like if you just got your tire punctured putting this in and thinking that it was going to last for a long time but what it does basically , it kind of fills the obstruction to where you can safely get to a place to get a new tire or get the tire repaired and it is pretty basic , pretty basic instruction .there are several different forms of this stuff. [CLS] [SEP]but you just read the instructions and apply it as needed. [CLS] [SEP]but then it does have its disadvantages because it will throw the wheel weight off on the tire and it will cause a vibration in the vehicle so if you ca n't fix the tire where you are at then that is fine. [CLS] [SEP]but this stuff is like a quick fix and this should do well like if you need to get home soon .so that concludes tire sealant .
after we 've done our research at the local aquarium and you 've read some books at the library , we 're ready to start getting our ideas down on paper and by this. [CLS] [SEP]i mean doing a nice little test drawing of what our mural is going to look like .now if you yourself are not artistically inclined , no problem .this is n't a barrier .maybe you have an artistic friend of yours who could help you .better yet , even collaborate on this project with you .so if that 's the case that 's great .but what we 're going to demonstrate here is just getting these ideas down on paper .think of this piece of paper as your wall .this is your wall that you 're going to be painting off of .so all the different marine creatures you found , let 's start getting them down here .here we have some clown fish , over here we have some seaweed from the depths .we also have a little crab going , hey , how 's it going , another like more of a puffer fish over here and up here of course we have a marlin .you know one of the more graceful creatures of the deep .so we want to make sure that we 're kind of understanding where our different drawings are going to go in relation to each other .we also want to make sure that we 're not drawing anything super scary .if you 're a shark enthusiast out there , you can make sharks kind of happy and friendly. [CLS] [SEP]but you really have to work at it .keep in mind this is going to be for a child and child 's imaginations are very vivid when it comes to things with sharp pointy teeth .so , keep that in mind .once more beyond this , do n't think of this as a straight jacket .this is a general guide , a road map for our mural .but as your painting along you may want to alter things , something looks a little bit out of flow , maybe you want three clown fish , etc .definitely it 's a guide , not a straight jacket .
in this clip , we 're going to talk about the proper way to flush your cooling system .in this step , we 're going to talk about the proper service procedure for hooking up your back flow prevention valve , your garden hose and your drain hose to the radiator cap .your back flow prevention valve is going to go on one way .the black end is going to meet up to the `` t '' that you installed on the inlet of your heater core/heater hose .unscrew the sealing cap , and screw the back flow valve down tight .then , we screw our garden hose into the connection here .the garden hose is what applies the back flow pressure , just using your household water pressure , into the system to reverse flush all of the contamination out of it .what i 'm going to do now is take my splash deflector , and i have a chunk of garden hose here installed ; and move my radiator cap , and install that into the field neck of the radiator .it 's just going to snap right in , just like so .i also have a bucket here to catch the old contaminated coolant .go ahead and set it up just like that .you 're going to want to use a bucket to catch the overflow coolant .it 's a felony to dispose of it on the ground or dump it out .you can recycle it at some part stores or at oil change facilities .that is the proper way to hook your vehicle up for the flushing process .
i am going to give you , with all of these variations , the technical name for these styles .personally i might not be that much of an expert , because i do n't know them as these .i 've never .i 've heard of them as a bishop sleeve , which is what i 'm going to show you right now .but i would n't know to call it that .i would just call it a poofy sleeve .i guess its not very technical , but this is going to be a bishop sleeve .and you 'll see in the dash lines here , i have the actual outline of the arm .that 's where if fabric on the sleeve were sheer , you would see the arm right here .bishop sleeve , you are going to want to blouse it a little .its going to be a little bit more flowy .think like almost a poet sleeve .i do n't really know where the term bishop is referenced from .but , we 'll pretend .so , you are going to have the arm , like in the dash lines .and then just follow the lines of the arm out a little bit .basically .and then here you have more of a frump curvature down to your cuff where it tightens again .there you go .
as we ’ re shampooing the male head , what you want to do with his hair. [CLS] [SEP]is you ’ re going to go ahead and saturate the hair with warm water .guys you can ’ t use cold water , after you get your hair saturated with water it does not take a lot of shampoo to wash your head .you get too much you ’ ll start getting build up , just a little bit of shampoo , work it through your hands .when you go to shampoo your head do not use your nails , you want to use your fingertips .so as you ’ re shampooing , its just fingertips , that ’ s all you want to do is use your fingertips .make sure you give yourself a good scrub , what that does is it helps release and clean out all those pores from all the sweat and oil glands .then we ’ re going to rinse the hair back out , we ’ re going to make sure that we rinse this thoroughly. [CLS] [SEP]cause you do not want to leave any build up shampoo in the hair .which could also give you clogged pores which could lead to male pattern baldness .then you would apply a little dollop of conditioner , just run that through the hair and then once again rinse .that is how you shampoo the male hair .
so , even though i 've said it 's not worth restoring a bike , of course people still want to do it .and cases where people generally will really restore a bike is if they still have their childhood bike , and they want to make it look as they remember it sitting under the christmas tree in 1963.and if you 've if you 're choosing to do a full restoration , a good question is am i going to be able to find the parts i need ?well , you certainly can , particularly if you 're looking at something from like the 30 's up to the 1970 's .parts before the 1930 's are hard to find .this this schwinn , which i showed you a little while ago , it does have some bad chips in the paint .if you look at the chain guard , i 'm not sure that you can see this. [CLS] [SEP], it says stingray like it should , but. [CLS] [SEP]but there you can tell that somebody rubbed off something else here .this was actually a chain guard from a girls ’ bike .it was a. [CLS] [SEP]it said fair lady here , and somebody has taken that off .now i did n't notice that when i bought the bike .if you were going to restore this bike , the chain guard , it did n't , it obviously was not original to this bike , and girls ’ bikes are less valuable than boys ’ bikes .the reason for that is boys , we took our bikes apart , and crashed them , and all that , and girls took pretty good care of their bikes , so there are a lot more girls ’ bikes around .a lot of times you 'll find girls ’ parts on a boys ’ bike .so this bike , if you were going to restore it , you could , you can find the original paint .there are companies that sell the original paint .there 's a certain process ; there 's a certain undercoat layer , and an overcoat , and a clear coat .and there are companies that sell these decals .you can get the proper decal for this chain guard , so it would be okay that this was from a girls ' bike , because the paint would have been stripped , and. [CLS] [SEP]the new decals ; you can apply your new decals , and silk screening .so basically , if if you are choosing to do a full restoration , you will be able to find the parts , particularly on the internet .
so moving on from the glue sticks .you are going to move into using your gel mediums or gloss medium .again these are acrylic based. [CLS] [SEP]so they 're water based which means that you can add water to them to change their consistency and usually they are used with acrylic paints but for todays purpose we are going to mix them with water .you can see that there is a little slight difference in color .this one is a little more , this one is called the fluid medium. [CLS] [SEP]so it is a little bit more watery on the inside. [CLS] [SEP]and it is kind of hard to see. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'll take a little bit out for you to see .it is a milky sort of color like consistency .the great thing about these is that they actually dry clear and that you are going to be using it on both the bottom of the collage material as well as on the top. [CLS] [SEP]so you 're not going to be dealing with the same issues that glue sticks would present which is having glue on the wrong side and trying to wipe it away , which sometimes removes some of the color of the paper .so you have here a very thick like consistency , a gooey consistency. [CLS] [SEP]and we want to kind of change that and make it a little milkier , a little waterier .so we 're going to do that next .
can you look through this book and see if you can find something that uses descriptive writing for us ?teacher pay is varied by the level of education , and their year 's of experience .here in nashville , i think the base pay starts at $ 35 to $ 36 ,000 with a bachelors , and runs all the way up into the fifties and sixties .in houston , the base pay for a first year teacher with a college degree is $ 46 ,000 , and it runs into the seventies .but it 's different throughout the nation .the starting salary for a teacher is on average between $ 35 ,000 and $ 45 ,000 .from what i 've seen right now , it 's capping in the $ 50 to $ 70 ,000 range , depending on the district you 're in .it 's dependent on how many years experience you have , sometimes in district as well as in education altogether .and it also depends on your level of education .it 's going to grow as long as they keep having children .
little flip of the tin , happy tin , happy drink .stir it a little bit , throw on some champagne .nice .put a cherry on that , little lemon action .when you talk about what 's the funniest thing that you 've encountered behind the bar or funny things that have happened , bartenders are going to laugh every single day because it does n't matter .i mean you want to keep your people safe but when people get a little intoxicated. [CLS] [SEP]they act a little goofy .you get the machismo , the crazy drunk roll , there 's beer goggles involved .there 's all kinds of things .but a couple of things that just stand out to me , two different spectrums .you get the guy who wants to be the man and tries to be all cool and stuff .but you 've heard of people drinking out of , drinking champagne out of high heels or shoes or whatever .i was working in the bar district of new york and this man came in and he was really trying to impress a lady. [CLS] [SEP]and i think he had to have been cocktailed .he insisted that i pour a drink in this woman 's shoe .the woman puts her shoe on the bar and it happens to be like a boot heel .it 's not even a high heel or whatever .there 's got to be some funk in that shoe. [CLS] [SEP]and he made me make a gin and tonic .now i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]not sure if the juniper in the gin killed it. [CLS] [SEP]but you know we 'll never know .i make at least three gin and tonics for this gentleman. [CLS] [SEP]and he tipped well. [CLS] [SEP]so i did it , but you know ?what of the other funny things , i was working a paul oakenfold rave at a night club and it was one of those ( makes beating noise ) kind of nights. [CLS] [SEP]and so there were ,at the time it was a big fad to put the glow in the dark like fishing lores or whatever your mouth and everybody wanted to glow and stuff .these two little girls came up and they were blonde haired blue eyes and they go `` yeah we 're just having a good time ''ordering drinks from me .so i 'm making their cocktails and one of them starts to freak out. [CLS] [SEP]and they look at me. [CLS] [SEP]and they go ``um what do we do if. [CLS] [SEP], what do we do if i swallowed the glow and dark thing ? ''i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]like `` i 'm a bartender i do n't know '' .i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]like `` did you bite it , did it say nontoxic ? '' .people just act really really goofy when they are out and about .you see people at their best and you see people at their worst and either way it can be very very entertaining .
first of all you want to start with a good base .good foundation to throw from .once you get that ; well , that requires just a good solid foundation where you 're in balance and if somebody comes to push you , you 're , you know , you 're set .at that point , square up you 're shoulders to where you 're throwing , take a nice step , throw it .there are a lot of different ways that you can throw a football .the main thing that you need to focus on are two hands on the ball .so , if somebody comes up from behind you or in front of you , they do n't knock it out of your hand .so , do n't be swinging around like this .two hands on the ball. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to keep the ball ideally up , up around your shoulders .you do n't want to carry the ball down here because what that does it causes you to have a slow release .and the further along you progress in your career ,the quicker the decisions need to be , and the quicker you need to get rid of the football .so , you might as well learn young .have the ball here and have the quickest release as possible meaning do n't take the ball here and then drop it down here to throw it .have the ball here , boom , quick release .you guys can watch john elway ; holds the ball here , does n't even wind up , throws it from there .dan marino , another great release .other things to know about throwing a football. [CLS] [SEP], like i said , about earlier , gripping the football ; whatever is comfortable to you , just as long as you get a nice feel and spiral .when you throw a football , you do n't throw it like a baseball like this .you throw a football like this , boom .so , what happens is , is the ball comes out , comes out of your hand and spirals to give it the ultimum trajectory to your target .
and we 're just going to do rhythm with it .you want to do it at every other beat , 1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4-1.so , i 'm just doing it by moving my hands quick like this and the weight of all the beads moving around here. [CLS] [SEP]does the movement itself .so , i 'm really just going like this with my hand , it is going .so , move it back and forth twice .you got ta just-it takes practice. [CLS] [SEP]then you 'll have this down pat .again , unified .
we started off with sharpening the blade and doing an oil change and an air filter , spark plugs. [CLS] [SEP]and we got into some more complex things like retorking down the head and cleaning your carburetor and cleaning it up and last and final step here. [CLS] [SEP]is starting her up and making sure everything works great .if it ’ s a self propel mower , making sure that that engages and goes forward and everything rolls the way. [CLS] [SEP]it ’ s suppose to. [CLS] [SEP]and it ’ s not smoking or surging in the mower ,anything like that .one other thing that i want to talk about about the engine speed is when you do have it running , the recommended engine speed it 3600rpm which is wide open throttle on these mowers .if you run it at any less if you have control of your throttle you ’ re really taking a chance because it needs that air flow to keep everything cool. [CLS] [SEP], you ’ re not helping the mower out by running it at a lower rpm .so we ’ re going to go ahead and give her a start. [CLS] [SEP], i ’ m going to pull the dead man switch here , this is the safety control to make sure that if you let go that the mower will die , you don ’ t want to put a cheater rope on it .this one has one on there. [CLS] [SEP]i ’ m going to cut it off , you don ’ t want to put that on there because it ’ s really for your safety , it ’ s not for not annoying thing. [CLS] [SEP]it ’ s to keep you from putting your fingers underneath the mower while it ’ s running .so go ahead and put that on there , i forgot the prime in here , give it a primer , give it three pumps there , put that on and just give it a pull .okay , everything seems to be working perfectly for this mower. [CLS] [SEP], it ’ s ready to go and cut grass in a great way .
now , i 'm going to be showing you the snapshot at full speed .a couple of things to remember are , that when doing a snapshot , you do n't want to ever raise your stick , above your knees .also , this is probably the most common shot to take , when given a one time pass , if you do n't decide to one time it , so i 'm going to show you some spots at full speed , and that 's a snapshot a full speed .
alright .now , we 've just compounded our board .we 've got it all smooth and slick .really feels good to the hand , to the touch .and , this is the kind of finish that if you walk up to it. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's just asking you to touch it. [CLS] [SEP]you know you 've done a good job .it looks good , it feels good .and , you 've achieved what you 're after .the very last thing we 're going to do is , the protective wax that we 're going to put on .this just gives a very thin barrier to the surface so it does n't change anything .just a little dab will do you to on this stuff .again , it 's an industrial product by 3m .and , it will just clean it up a little bit .and , give it a little protection , but it wo n't change anything that we 've done so far .other than. [CLS] [SEP], just make it look a little bit richer and deeper .and again , you just put this one and keep buffing until it all disappears .and , then find another clean spot on your rag and give it one final buff .alright , this is basically your finished product .it 's just a finish on a small sample board .you know , we started with a board like this .we ended up with a finish like this .in between , we had to put a filler on .this is what a lot of people avoid , is this step right here .and , if it were n't for this step , you would n't have this clear flat surface .you 'd have a real grainy open pored finish .so , of all the finishing. [CLS] [SEP]i 've done today the most important thing is this filler .once this is on and applied properly , you get a much prettier finish in the end .so , as you can tell when we start with something as simple as a piece of mahogany plywood we can turn it into a really nice finish .same thing we do on old furniture .something you may have around the house. [CLS] [SEP], you want fixed up. [CLS] [SEP]you can take it down the bare wood and bring the finish back in something like this .and , bring it back to where it was in. [CLS] [SEP]it 's original beauty .you can also take dining room tabletops and things like that and refinish .so , this is just a small scale of what we do on a large scale .but , to give you an idea. [CLS] [SEP]all the steps are the same .and , a lot of times you 'll hear a fifteen step process .and , that 's pretty much what we 've gone through .and , anytime you get around a fifteen , sixteen process. [CLS] [SEP]you know you 've got a finish that 's going to be like this .a really pretty finish that 's going to be durable for the longevity for the piece of furniture .
now we 're moving on to eyeliner .this is one of the last steps in the eye department .for this look , you really do n't want to do eyeliner on top of the eye .you want to just do it inside the eye .you can do a black if you wanted it to be a little more dramatic , but we 're keeping pretty natural with her , so i 'm going to do a dark shimmery brown .it 's a mac liner .it 's called teddy .it 's a deeper bronze brown and it 's got a big of a glitter or glow to it , so. [CLS] [SEP]it 's a cool look .i 'm going to go right into the inside of her eye and ever so gently , apply this liner .be very , very gentle when you 're going inside the eye like that .it gives a nice cool smokey look .okay .that gave a nice smokey look .lastly , before we do mascara , i 'm just going to add a little bit of a highlight into the inside corner of the eye .i 'm again using that light champagne color i used as a base .i 'm using an angle brush and going right into the corner .that 'll make the eyes really pop , especially since we did the smokey liner .
i 'm here today to talk to you about bikram yoga , and specifically , the question , is bikram yoga good for flattening abdominals ?so any yoga is beneficial in weight loss , and contracting the abdominal muscles , if you do the style of yoga properly .bikram yoga , specifically , is a yoga that 's practiced in a hot room , so not only are you exercising the muscles , and creating a contract and release of the abdominal muscles , within each pose and within each breath , but you 're also met with a hot room , and essentially , sweating out your toxins , and sweating out lots of water weight too , so flattening your stomach is , it 's a little bit of a puzzle .you have to observe correct eating habits .you have to observe correct abdominal control , and contraction , through asana practice , and bikram yoga does help with increasing the detoxification benefits , through the external heat , that you 'll find , so is bikram yoga effective for flattening your stomachs ?i hope so .
this is a handy way to get in one single shot how many changes there are on any given guitar .if you are considering purchasing a guitar or buying someone 's used one , this is an important thing to know .how it is set up and how it functions .these could be changed .i could take all those rods out from underneath my guitar and make this completely different. [CLS] [SEP]but it is very helpful to have the written chart just how it is designed. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's like your little road map to your pedal steel guitar .i have n't done it on this chart but on another one i have the gages of the strings that i use for each of those so that i can remind myself if it 's a .10 or .22. [CLS] [SEP], i have a little handy reference guide for that .so that is important .it 's called the copedant. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm afraid that i do n't know the origination of that word but there are some who say it was invented strictly for the pedal steel guitar to describe how they are set up .
hi , i 'm emily larew and in this segment we 're going to look at triceps push ups .it 's really important as a hip hop dancer when you 're doing the pops and the waves to be able to isolate your arm muscles .and what better way of doing that my also warming up doing some push ups .one of my favorites to do in class is where you 're sitting down on the floor , making sure that your feet are apart , your fingers are actually going to face forward .so i 'm doing it towards you right now. [CLS] [SEP]so you can kind of see , instead of my back being towards you .your fingers are forward ; make sure they 're there the whole time , all right .they 're right underneath your shoulders .you 're going to lift up .now you want to make sure that you 're not doing a bottom -- this is not working your arms .so going from the side , you want to make sure your fingers are facing forward towards your leg , and you 're going to keep your bottom up. [CLS] [SEP], it never touches the floor .you lower your elbows , bend them , and push up .make sure it 's not just this , because you can be lazy and never develop any muscle at all .so bend all the way down and up .usually , i do eight with my feet on the floor .from there , i 'll do four with my right leg up , flexed .so you 've got one , two , three , four .cross it over , one , two , three , four .again , up , six , then i lower , seven , eight .then you 're doing this left , four , three , two , do n't give up , you 're going to be really strong , five , six , seven , and eight .two more .up and two , lowering down , three and four .and then i usually stretch and stretch out my arms .good job .that was triceps push ups .
of course if you are going bus , automobile , cruise ship you do n't have to worry about it , but a carry-on is a carry-on in a plane. [CLS] [SEP]and there are requirements and specifications as to weight and size .once you get that established you are good to go .now , what to put in a carry-on ?first and foremost what you are going to need ; travel documents , passport .is that required for where you are going ?you need to know that ahead of time .tickets , those things need to go .what i always do is when i am packing my carry-on bag. [CLS] [SEP]i always have my tickets and my paperwork that i will need easily accessible , perhaps on an outside pouch .next thing we are going to need , always have a pen handy. [CLS] [SEP]so you do n't have to rely on anybody else 's .next , it does n't have to be this big , but i always like to have some writing paper around because sure as beans you always need it again , in the outside pocket .nice and flat and easily accessible .then something else that you would like to have with you at all times even in the case of lost luggage have with you any medications that you would have to have .got a prescription for something ?keep it with you .eye drops ?keep it with you .and then any other kind of meds just like for a headache or something .and then always girls , got to have your tide stick in case you are a sloppy sipper .all of these things can go in its only little bag inside .and of course if you are on a plane they always have some kind of ready material or videos and neat things to watch , but i always find getting hooked on a good book. [CLS] [SEP]is always something good even just to sit and read at the airport .put that in , a little reading material .now , another controversial subject of course is liquids .are they allowed on planes nowadays ?sometimes yes , sometimes no .i would suggest contacting your airline that you are traveling on and ask what is the current stipulation with respect to liquids being taken on an airplane ?then believe it or not , don ?t laughs , i always take some crackers or cookies , just little munchies that i can have in case i want a nibble .and i do n't always like peanuts. [CLS] [SEP]either , so i take my own little crackers or cookies and stick them in there .that should be just about it .i have got my carry-on ready to go .watch out for the next segment .we are going to wrap it all up and we will be ready to travel .
here are some examples .sometimes people take just small balls of clay , and that 's what we start out with .i have some examples of some students here that perhaps just comes out to be a little pot like this , which is fine .this , by the way , has been bisque fired , and we 'll talk about that later .but with a little bit more clay , as you progress , your pots start getting bigger , perhaps into a bowl .and so it kind of morphs itself bigger shape with more clay , and. [CLS] [SEP]hopefully you get a little better at it .now this piece i wanted to show you , because we 're going to talk about the importance of compressing .this is really important .and this always tells me that somebody did n't compress the bottom of their clay good enough , and when that happens we always get a crack somewhere in the bottom right around in the center .what will happen in the high fire that cone 11 , at 2400 degrees , what will happen is this crack will open up , and then the glaze seeps down in it , and it sticks to the shelf , and then the pot is ruined along with the shelf ( and we do n't like that. [CLS] [SEP]- that costs a lot of money ! ) .
for our mural , we 're going to be painting this whole wall .everything on here , this pale color is going to go away entirely .that means that we need to prepare our wall and floor just like we would a normal painting project .starting off with taping .get your good blue , electrical , painter 's tape , and start ripping off pieces of it .what we 're going to be doing here is we 're going to be covering up the trim .you can already see i 've done an awful lot of this , but we want to make sure there are no gaps and the like .areas where you could see where like paint could drip over and basically ruin our wood .now sometimes you may get a little bit of paint on the wood no matter how good your efforts are but painting , putting on the painting tape helps avoid a lot of that .to put this on , basically what you want to do is have the edge up as close to the gap as possible .now for tape placement , what we want to do is put the tape edge as close as we can to the gap .press down with your fingers to make sure you have a good grip .also , do n't leave the tape dangling off the edges .your thumb 's great at wrapping that around the corners .so next , we 're going to be removing all of our faceplates in the room .these include electrical outlets , light switches , cable phone jacks , because we do n't want to be painting over this as we 're doing our mural .now some people like to put more of our good old blue painters tape over the outlets as well to cover them up .i do n't like doing that. [CLS] [SEP], i usually find that the protection is not and there 's a much easier way rather than doing all that taping .namely getting a good flathead screwdriver and taking the face plate off here .basically put the flathead into the screw , start spinning counter clockwise until it comes loose , and you remove the faceplate .next , i am going to use some blue tape to cover up the remaining outlet here .usually one strip will do it , kind of tuck it around to where it 's still covering up the metal but not the wall because you want to be able to paint all the wall surface. [CLS] [SEP]that you can .tuck it underneath there , make sure it 's a good seal .there you go .you can go over this with a whole brush and your still going to be fine when you take that tape off .just a few more things to cover before we can actually start painting .one of these is putting a drop cloth down .this is like protecting all of your carpet area by having your drop cloth .these come in actual cloth , more commonly now days , they come in a nice clear plastic .so , you unfold this which it 'll unfold many , many different times , and you 'll be able then to cover up your carpet area .now again , there are different styles here .some people will just leave it like this , other folks will actually want to more directly stick the drop cloth to the wall to make sure that it stays because it can drift when you 're walking over it .it can definitely get snagged and pull away from the wall .but make sure your carpet is entirely covered , that 'll protect your carpet from the paint and you 're ready for the creative process to begin .
corn should have a nice bright husk all the way around like this one does. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to make sure that it is tight all the way around .now these end leaves are definitely going to be loose every single time. [CLS] [SEP]but the rest of it needs to be nice and tight on there .now , the silk which is the area that looks like little strings needs to be a white color. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to avoid real , real dark brown silk .this one is still light brown which is still good .if you open up your husk at the grocery store , you want to make sure your kernels inside are tightly packed , you want to make sure they 're tiny and you should have good corn all the time .you might want to feel your corn all the way around and make sure it 's nice and firm all the way around , it should be hard .this is the example of a bad corn at your grocery store ; one with very bad silk , one that is split open , the skin is everywhere and you can open it up. [CLS] [SEP]and you can see the kernels in there are discolored and just groose. [CLS] [SEP], you do n't want to pick a corn that looks like this guys .you want to use your best judgment when picking corn , obviously it 's not a hard pick , this one looks a lot better .you want to make sure it 's nice and firm , tight wrap all the way around , a lightly brown silk and. [CLS] [SEP]you should have very good corn all the time .corn is best in the refrigerator , but i recommend that the day you buy your corn is the day that you use your corn .so if you do need to store it , store it in the refrigerator but definitely use your corn right away .that is the short segment on picking corn , i 'll talk to you later thank you .
this is such a simple recipe , all you have to do is slash a baguette in half , top each half with about a fourth a cup of pasta sauce , sprinkle on a little grated cheese , pop it in the microwave oven , on high , just long enough to melt the cheese , and you 've got fresh hot pizza .of course , you can jazz up these pizzas by adding sliced pepperoni , canned mushrooms , and sliced black olives .be creative , use your imagination , and that 's how you make dorm room pizza .i 'm alexa sparkman until next time .
ok , now we 've already covered the lob serve .now we 're going to do what 's called the backhand serve .so i 'm going to be on the right side serving with a backhand .now this is very similar to a backhand volley but on this shot we 'll be angling it diagonal and try to get the ball to come up the side wall against our opponent .it 's a great serve , at the pro level a lot of players now are using this backhand serve vs. [CLS] [SEP]a forehand. [CLS] [SEP]serve because it allows them , when they hit this serve it allows them to watch their opponent just a little more intently .because in this game it 's not always about power , it 's about getting the knowledge of where your opponent 's going to be .so the backhand serve from the right side. [CLS] [SEP]is the racket 's up. [CLS] [SEP], you have the ball right here ; throw it and you serve it over there .so once again you throw it up ; that one 's pretty good and that one 's not too bad .so the idea here is you see how my body is turned ; i 'm facing my opponent for the most part. [CLS] [SEP], i find a spot on the front wall that i want to hit. [CLS] [SEP]and i throat hit it right up there .so it 's just a matter of now. [CLS] [SEP]i can see my opponent. [CLS] [SEP]and i can be ready for the next shot .so this is what you want to do with a backhand serve , you can hit hard ; you can hit it soft .we 'll cover a couple different varieties of pace on the next segment .
so i am ready to attack with my involved stage 1 wailord here. [CLS] [SEP]and i have got enough energies on him to use his rely on friends .it is very important to read the bottoms of the attacks and not just look at the number that they do of damage .for example this attack does 40 damage plus 40 more damage for each stage 1 involved pokemon i have on my bench .i currently do n't have any. [CLS] [SEP]so it is only going to do 40 damage. [CLS] [SEP]but if my lapras had been involved i would have done 80 damage with this attack .when you attack there are many different things that this could do .most of your attacks are going to do damage anywhere between 10 to maybe even 100 damage depending on the attack .the attack could also do special things depending on special conditions that your pokemon has met or that you have met yourself having certain amount of cards or a certain amount of pokemon on your bench .some attacks will also give you bonuses like you will get to draw a card or. [CLS] [SEP]also other cards will put special conditions on the other pokemon such as asleep , burned , or poisoned .that 's something we will take a look at a little bit later .some attacks have you flip a coin .usually if it is heads the attack works , usually if it is tales the attack does n't .it all depends on what the card says .you need to get pretty good at flipping coins and playing pokemon .
first of all of course , the star of the show , we are going to need our rabbit .we are also going to need some bell pepper and garlic which i like to use garlic in almost everything even ice cream. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to use shallot .you can also use onions but the shallot to me has a milder flavor plus its got those elements of garlic .then i use my basic seasoning mix .you use whatever you like .
so you grab this. [CLS] [SEP]you just drag it to your stage and you can see it brings it up. [CLS] [SEP]and then you want to go to parameters , so you bring up your parameters which is also under window , component inspector .there 's your parameters. [CLS] [SEP]now there 's many things you can set here in auto play , auto rewind , your buffer time and. [CLS] [SEP]right here it says content path .this is where you set the movie that you want to play in here. [CLS] [SEP]so you want to click here and you can choose on your computer where your file is , choose this one , and of course you can set it to match , the dimensions of this file .we 'll have that selected and as you can see it changed the size of the movie , and once you have everything set here. [CLS] [SEP]you can also change the skin here once you have everything set. [CLS] [SEP]you can just close that down .and your flash movie is ready to play inside a flash and that 's how you set up a flash movie using the movie component in flash cs3. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm bill macpherson for expert village .
hi , in this segment we 're going to actually talk about a nail delay on the top side of the frisbee .we call that an upside down delay or a ud delay .now you can toss the frisbee with a lot of throw with a lot of spin with the throw or you can just spin it up yourself .this is the easiest way to start to do it .the way i like to do it. [CLS] [SEP]or you can actually give yourself a backhand .so ryan here is going to actually. [CLS] [SEP], that 's the upside down center nail delay .you can also do that counter clockwise and again you want to keep your nail right in the center and this one you do n't get the opportunity to go in the rim .so you really have to concentrate on keeping that in the center .focus on the center and it 'll lead you to a lot of different types of trick catches and trick moves .once you get that you could go under the leg with a set with an upside down center delay .under the other leg you can do all sorts of tips and different types of catches .
calab labarda : all right .now , we 're going to be going over our front spins or up and down strikes .so remember , always hold your nunchucks one thumb-length from the top ,okay ?this is what it 's going to look like .you 're going to put it on your shoulders , spin down and strike .one , spin back up , two , okay ?from the side , one , two .from the other side , one , two , okay ?now , let 's go ahead and break it down .so from the top , you 're going to hold it in between your fingers .pinch , okay ?now , from here you 're going to spin one complete spin all the way over and down .one complete spin up , backwards , one , two , okay ?now , from the side , it 's going to look like this .go straight forward , one , spin over , two , spin back , one , two ,okay ?with one nunchuck , it 's like one , two .and you can switch up and do opposites , which is a good practice for your brain , training your brain to do two different things at once with your body .one , two , spin , one , okay ?so now , i 'm doing opposite spins .so from the front , at a pinch , complete one , two , one , two .switch from this side , one , two , one , two .and then you start going faster .remember , there are strikes .strike , strike , strike ,okay ?to the front .okay ?and then strike .bam .one , two .forward together from here .one , two , three , four , okay ?and those -- that 's going to be your up and down strike or your up and down spins .
welcome back , i 'm chef donn o. [CLS] [SEP]we are making our classic eggs benedict today .we have our onions going for the potatoes .the potatoes have been blanched .our hollandaise is made and now it is time to poach the eggs .first off what i need to do is add acid to the poaching liquid .what this does you can add either lemon or vinegar .what the acid does is holds the whites to the yolks otherwise , what will happen is you will have a poached yolk and the egg white will be all over the pan .we are going to add a generous amount of lemon to this water .we are going to let that heat up and. [CLS] [SEP]while that is going on you will notice our onions are nicely brown so it is time to add the potatoes , mix them up , and we are going to increase the heat here because we want our breakfast potatoes actually browned .i am going to add a little bit of salt and black pepper and maybe a teaspoon. [CLS] [SEP]and we can adjust it accordingly afterwards .now add a little bit of black pepper .i always prefer to put it in my hand first before it goes over .a lot of times it goes over and it is hard to get the pepper out. [CLS] [SEP]so this regulates it .okay now i will leave the potatoes alone for a little bit .i will let them brown on the side that is done right now. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'll flip it and brown them a little more .we want them to be a nice golden brown and somewhat crisp .what i am going to do now is move these to the back burner and we can toast our english muffin and our canadian bacon .once that is ready we will drop our eggs in our poaching liquid .you do n't want to drop your eggs first because they might over cook .you want to bring them out right on time .okay. [CLS] [SEP]so let 's go to the back burner .now i prefer to do the english muffin with butter in a pan .
the next step on our 2-5-7-10 box after we 've scored all the lines , you 're going to go ahead and take your paper snips. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to cut .on the 2 inch side , you 're going to cut over 3 of the blocks .then you 're going to cut .you 'll leave one block and you 'll cut this last bit of a block off here .that 's going to be the top and a lid for your box .then you 're going to come down and cut this one corner off here .then you 're just going to take and cut up to these score lines .3 cuts there .the other thing i like to do on this cutting is just give these one corners a little nip in on both sides .you 'll see when we 're assembling that why we do that .now you 've done all your scoring and all your cutting .now we 're going to get ready to do some stamping .you can do your stamping , or you can roll with a wheel .for this demonstration , we 're going to be doing some stamping with hearts .
i 'm going to use a half sheet .so here is my half sheet of card stock , you need a exacto knife , a pair of scissors , some marking pencils , some pens or decorative pencils to do some accent , a ruler and a simple pattern of a birthday cake .we are going to start with our half sheet of card stock .you want to fold that in half. [CLS] [SEP]so you want to match the corners exactly and hold those down .then just slide your hands to the edge and crease that line .now turn it over and on the back. [CLS] [SEP]we are going to measure a inch and a half from the center on both sides .i 'm going to mark this , this is a dark card stock i 'm going to mark it with a white marking pencil .i 'm going to mark another inch and a half there and a inch and a half there .i 'm going to move down , we are going a inch and a half from the center .a inch and a half here and a inch and a half here , and just draw a line through your two dots .not too dark. [CLS] [SEP]cause. [CLS] [SEP]later you will want to erase that , if you do n't want to see those lines .okay. [CLS] [SEP]so now you have two lines there .now take your pattern and we are going to trace it. [CLS] [SEP]but we are only going to trace the outside of the birthday cake .you put the center we folded up our pattern in half exactly. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to place that half crease right in the center crease of the card .we are only going to trace the outside of the cake .from everything outside of the line that you mark .so anything that over laps and is outside of that. [CLS] [SEP]and you are just going to trace that much .there and then place that back and do trace only the other side .everything on the outside of the line .so you have something that looks like that .
now , what i want to talk about is my personal favorite move , is the half rollover into a spin move .now , basically when you do this your back is going to be towards the goal your attacking and your going to want to spin into the goal or into the direction of the goal .now , the way i do this is , i 'm rolling the ball .i do a roll and instead of completing the full roll i spin it around the other way and roll it back .so , its .and , your going the other way .so , its all about how you do with your hips .and , you turn .so , on a defender it looks like this .
now we 're going to go ahead and glue the different circles , the different layers on top of the original layer .it 's going to be a little bit different. [CLS] [SEP]gluing felt on felt. [CLS] [SEP], so make sure that you have a good glue .and it 's also important , again , to get the edges as we did on the first layer , because this layer can also start peeling upward , which is just a natural tendency for cloth .that 's not very hard .and because it 's not hard , it can constantly start coming up on the edges , so you really want to make sure that you have a nice , solid strip of glue around the outer edge , and that it gets pressed down nice and tight .now when we put the circles onto the flat cardboard surface on the original layer , it does n't have to be one right on top of each other , in the middle .in other words , concentric circles .you can actually put the second layer in a little bit of a different position , and this will just make a different type of -- change the strategy a little bit of the game , when trying to throw the ball and hit a certain spot on the dartboard .and again , also the circles can be all different sizes depending on how hard or how easy you want to make the game .but there 's really no set way to place the circles .we 've purposefully put them on the bottom , so that the outer edge is a little bit more pronounced , and that will just change the way the game is played .so just keep that in mind when you 're making your shakes and your making the sizes .so this is the way that we glue the layers on top of each other to make the circles of our dartboard .
g , g , g.whoa !g. [CLS] [SEP]okay , i couldn ’. [CLS] [SEP]t stop. [CLS] [SEP]so i am going to have to turn them around .you ’ re going to get a chance to see that .whoa !i had a pair of young leaders up front and just like a horse to go back to the barn ,the one leader and they are both the same size. [CLS] [SEP]so they neutralize each other power wise .but anyway the left hand leader wanted to go back to the truck. [CLS] [SEP]and i needed to go right ,so there was very little snow .i tried to put my snowhook in , but i couldn ’ t stop .i had to let them go through the turn and down about 50 yards where there is no snow and hard packed to get a snow hook in .you always put the snow hook on the same side you are going to u-turn to , so you don ’ t flip your sled which would happen if you did it the other way if you put it on the outside of the turn , so i put it on the inside of the turn .i went up to the leaders , grabbed them and brought them back .you want to make the other dogs stay pretty stationary .as soon as the leaders get by the rear end of the sled , you have to be pretty quick .i tell them to hike up and take that snowhook up pretty quickly and have a good hand on the sled , let it get spun around. [CLS] [SEP]and you leave with the sled going the other direction .we have a bit of a tangle here .so , you just got to see how to turn a team around and this is a turn .
o.k , here we are back learning to play the upright bass , and we 've been working on a simple walking bass line .we 're going to try it in the key of d now .starting with our open d string .if you remember the notes that we learned , playing in this first finger pattern .we 're going to play the d , the f sharp and the a. [CLS] [SEP]now , make notes of all of these things , write down as much as you can to help you remember because these three notes are the d major chord .now , we 're just going to play up and down the line starting with open d , fourth finger , first finger , back down .let 's try that , d , f sharp , a , f sharp , d. [CLS] [SEP]and , since we 're playing the walking bass line , we 're not going to be repeating the notes , but just try to keep as steady beat as possible , so that you 're not slowing down when you go from one string to the next .once you get it under your fingers better , you can play it at any tempo that you think is comfortable .one , two , three , four , one , two .remember we learned that in a , you learned it on e.so , now you have it in three different keys by using the same finger pattern and just moving it over to different strings .
in this clip , i 'm going to talk about how to fake cry .well , there 's two different ways you can do it , and you can actually do a combination of both as well .there 's an internal way , and there 's an external way , and you can use a mix of both to really help you get on your way to doing that .but you should definitely try the internal way. [CLS] [SEP]because -- always -- because that will help it be real to you .so you need to , very simply , think of something that makes you cry .so you know , what moves you , what makes you cry .think about it .put yourself in the environment .i am there right now , and it 's happening to me right now .you know , what does it smell like when this particular event happened that made me cry ?what were the sounds that i heard ?go through all your senses to give you sense memory to make it very real to you .what ...you know , what did it feel like ?what was the temperature like ?what ...who was in the room ?what was the person wearing ?what ...you know , what were ... [CLS] [SEP]everything .and it 'll get you to a place where you want to cry .and even if tears do n't come , i mean , you can just , like , kind of fake it 'til you make it , and just , like , feel it .and , you know , and , you know , just feel really sad .and the other thing is , if you really need tears and you ca n't get them , just ...this is the external way .do n't blink .do n't blink for , like , about a minute coming up , and then , eventually , the air will make it so that your eyes start watering .and then you can kind of use it and mix it in with your internal method acting crying .this has been athena reich in new york city .
our subject today is the hp 45 cartridge .the hp 45 cartridge fits about 45 milliliters of ink .to fill it up first you will need to remove a black cover exposing this bb .once seen you can push the bb into the center of the cartridge and have no worry it will not damage anything in the printer .once you have pushed the bb into the cartridge you need to inflate the center bladder .to do so get a syringe without a needle , insert and push in about 10 milliliters of ink .some ink may come out of the top of the print head but do n't worry that is a good sign that the print head is clean .next after you have inflated the bladder get a syringe full of ink , put in about a quarter of an inch and slowly depress the ink filling the cartridge .once again it should take about 45 milliliters .the last part to refilling the hp 45 cartridge is to place a bb back in the top and depress firmly .after that is accomplished , place it on a paper towel for about 15 minutes .it will leak about 5 milliliters of ink causing a mess. [CLS] [SEP]so please do so in an appropriate location .after about 15 minutes of dripping , it is pressurized and ready to use .
how to build big arms .first i would start with a stage called hypertrophy which is your very basic muscle building stage .for those who are beginners this is the stage you really want to be in .from maybe about ten to twelve reps , about three sets depending on your age , depending on your stature and what you are going to do is put together a combination of how to workout your arms .which i 'm going to do for you today .so we are going to work the biceps. [CLS] [SEP], we are going to work the triceps , and we may be able to get a little bit of delts in there , that goes around the shoulder area .first i 'm going to start out with the basic biceps curl .for those of you who are beginners , i strongly suggest that you start seated .so i have my dumbbells. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to sit at the end of the bench .again your posture is just as important as doing the exercise .so you want to make sure again curling up and down .full range of motion .up and down , keeping your elbows by your side .seated is highly recommended for beginners. [CLS] [SEP]so you have control over the exercise .another way to do a bicep curl is called concentration curl .so what you are going to do is slightly lean on your inner thigh , put your other hand weighted on your other leg .and all you are going to do is up down .again full range of motion .and another one just so you can put icing on top of the cake is what i like to call it , is the hammer curl .again it 's seated but all you are doing is turning your grip .so from here you are going to hand grip , now here you have a neutral grip .so you are doing the same range of motion except you are turning your arms .now i 'm going to turn to the side view for you .again good posture , same range of motion except with a different grip .now i do my shoulder press closed grip .just to ensure the safety of my shoulders .so what i 'm going to do here is bring the weights up they are about shoulder height. [CLS] [SEP]and i keep my elbows. [CLS] [SEP]i call kissing .so they are about shoulder length , from here i go straight up keeping that space in between my head .it 's ok if your elbows venture a little bit out .just like this and you are keeping your back up against the padding .
alright we 're going to go ahead and start with our puree .so we 're going to get a can opener , and we 're going to open our can of coconut milk .we 're going to measure out a half cup , we 're going to add this in stages because we 're using a small food processor .take our top off , we 're going to try to get a nice mixture of onions , potatoes and garlic .from here we 've put a little less than half , so we 're going to put a little less than half , the same amount of our coconut milk in , and then we 're going to , and then we 're going to transfer this mixture , right here into our bowl , and then we 're going to go ahead and repeat until everything is all mixed together .
sometimes it sticks to your pot , sometimes it does n't .so when you get clay on your tool , any tool for that matter , clean it off , set it aside .so you start with a nice clean tool , so that as you take your tool , touch your piece , remember this is still kind of sticky , your clay trimmings do n't transfer from your tool back onto your pot .you 're trying to get it off of your pot .so we 're going to come down in here again , clean some more of that off .see how you have that all down there ?you have to clean this off .sometimes you just get little pieces of clay .clean it off , you 've got a lot of time .so you have a nice smoothed out bottom down there .that 's it .
okay .now you can see that this is very rich and gooey cake .if your cake has sunk in like mine did , you can just take some of these ends and just fill the middle in a bit. [CLS] [SEP]and nobody will notice when you cut that cake because it is such a rich cake .next we are going to put our raspberry jam on there that has a little bit of brandy , a little bit of liquor on it and just pour that all over the cake and spread it nicely .next we are going to put a layer of ganache. [CLS] [SEP]and we have our ganache now .we are just going to put a couple of spoon fulls and just lay it out .okay. [CLS] [SEP]and we will reserve the rest to over on the top and just spread that out to the edge .this is a very very rich cake and now we will take our top and flip it over to the bottom .i want to match to my tooth pick to tooth pit here. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll do that and take the spring form can bottom out and just carefully peel back the foil .okay , at this point let 's just take a napkin and wipe any crumbs off the plate. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to remove our toothpicks like that .next we wil be covering our cake with the remaining ganache .
before you start using the loose powder makeup , you need to know what tools to use and the basics of how to use loose powder .loose powder can be tricky .it can be messy , and you really want to know what tools to use also before you start .with loose powders , like i said earlier , you can use them on any part of your body .eyes , lips , cheeks , and you can use them wet or dry , which is fantastic .you want to use something to mix them .some sort of little plate or petri dish. [CLS] [SEP]so you can mix them wet or dry. [CLS] [SEP]so you do n't make a mess of everything .you also want to make sure you have good brushes .good brushes that you can use wet or dry .foundation brushes are synthetic .you can use them wet .powder brushes are natural .you use them dry .same thing with eye shadow brushes .you want a synthetic eye shadow brush that you can use wet , but you also want a natural hair brush that you can use dry .depending how you want to use your mineral makeup , which i say use it both ways .you want to make sure you have the right tools .a great little makeup line is called herbs of grace .they 're an all-natural mineral makeup line .you can go to herbsofgrace.com and check them out .they 're probably my favorite one when it comes to this type of makeup , so i 'm going to be using a lot of that .
cause a lot of times grandfathers can get kind of bored .so they want to pick up a new hobby. [CLS] [SEP]maybe he likes to listen to folk or blues .the harmonica is a great instrument to accent that kind of music also a harmonica can really help them to strengthening his lungs .because of the breathing techniques required with the use of the harmonica .also the harmonica is a good play along instrument with his favorite songs .this would be a very creative gift to give to your grandfather if he does n't know how to play a harmonica and you are getting it to him for the first time .you have give him a how to book. [CLS] [SEP]and you can just order those anywhere .you can get them at a music store or off of ebay and also you can the harmonica at the same place .this is ashley with expert village and a harmonica would be a great gift for the music loving grandfather .
we 're putting together a country western star and the next thing we 're going to do is select the music .now , there are a lot of things out there for country western because it 's so popular nowadays. [CLS] [SEP]and i prefer the tapes .they 're a lot less expensive than cd 's .you might want a little bit of patsy cline because everybody enjoys patsy cline tunes and you might even put them in segments of three or four patsy cline segments .and then here 's hank williams .maybe you would like to put three or four of hank williams songs together .he 's got such fun stuff .coming back from , oh , in the forties and fifties , all the way up until , well , you might have even heard his old songs on a new commercial .`` hey good looking , what you got cooking '' .they use those on t.v . [CLS] [SEP]now anne murray .she is one that sings down low like i do .so when you select the music , try to find people who have songs not only that you recognize , and that everybody loves , but something that 's right for your voice , your vocal range .do you sing high ?well , if you do n't know where you sing , where do you speak ?if you speak high , you probably sing high .i speak low. [CLS] [SEP], i sing low .here 's another wonderful , sometimes you get tired of singing. [CLS] [SEP], you might want to put on some line dances and then the people get up. [CLS] [SEP]and they dance a little bit .it gives your voice a rest and you do n't have to sing every song .in fact , you can get down there and do some of the dances too .let ?s see. [CLS] [SEP], this is `` always on my mind '' , willie nelson .everybody loves willie nelson tunes and the everly brothers .now there was something that i would have put in my fifties show , which you can cross over .the everly brothers can cross over from the fifties into a country western show , so i get them to do double duty .if you can do that , you can save a buck .
all right while our rice cakes are starting to cook .we 're going to go ahead and take our gloves and put them on and take the shells off of our shrimp .we 're going to start at the back and remove. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to check each of of our shrimp for lines here in the back. [CLS] [SEP]and there 's anything black in there .just run your finger right down and take that out and this one and on this one we can pull from the front .or you can go ahead and pull from the side .so it 's really up to you which way is easiest for you to take the shells off .all right these are all off now .now we put these in here. [CLS] [SEP]so we do n't cross contaminate any other situations .so we 're going to take our glove case and pull in .pull that into a ball and then throw these away. [CLS] [SEP]and we have n't contaminated any other surface .
over the next few sections we 're going to be talking about the building block of learning which is letter sounds .two different types of letter sounds , there are consonants which are most of the alphabet. [CLS] [SEP]and then there are 5 vowels .the 5 vowels you should know. [CLS] [SEP]but they are a e i o and u.now the vowels we pronounce very differently when we 're teaching children so that they get a very clear understanding of how to pronounce when they 're reading and that will help them in sounding out words tremendously .the consonants i 'm going to talk about first .now the consonants , if you remember sounding out , you might of remember people say ku a t ; cat .now that 's very close , that 's very good .but to make it even more clear we 're going to take the vowel off the consonant .so instead of saying ku a t , we 're going to kaat .now the difference is there is no uh in front of each consonant because when we say cat we do n't say kuata .look at that little kuata running down the street and we want children to be as clear as possible especially when we 're starting out .so to make sure that you 're not doing that with consonants , put your hand in front of your mouth .if you feel a little puff of air , cu cu cu , on your hand , you know you 're doing it wrong .if you do n't feel that puff of air ca ca ca , you know you 're doing it right .cat , cat , now you may feel a little puff with the t , but try to minimize it as much as possible. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's how we start to teach them to sound out .now the vowel can go a long time .there are 5 vowels and you can stretch it as long as you feel the child needs caaat , like that .and that 's how we enunciate letter sounds .
we 're with hip expressions belly dance studio , in saint petersburg , florida .we 're going to take our shimmy , and do a a backward horizontal figure eight with it .so make sure you get your shimmy going nice and strong .we 're going to bring it to the front , keep it out there , angle it to the back corner , slide it through your body to the other corner and back .slide it through , point to that corner , bring it around to the back , then to the opposite corner , bring it around to the back , and then speed it up a little bit .make sure that your chest stays nice and still , so you can see the hip movements .make sure your heels are pressed into the floor , and your knees stay bent , so that your body has all the action going right into the hips .keep your chin nice and lifted , and make it look really effortless .you can do this if you practice this in the mirror each day , and make sure that your hips stay nice and even .keep breathing and watch that belly button .you 're going to feel your weight shift from outside of your foot to the other outside ,yeah , good .practice this over and over till ' you get it nice and smooth .
i 'm here holding the dermacolor palette which is probably my favorite 'cause it supplies a wide range of colors that usually you do n't have to mix them .they 're pretty good at matching any skin tone there is .so first i 'm going to take my spatula .let 's see which one that goes here .this one 's a little bit more yellow. [CLS] [SEP]right here. [CLS] [SEP]so we 'll probably put this one right here on our palette .see our little metal palette right here , okay ?and then next , we will probably put a little bit more of this fleshy tone with the yellow , put a yellow tone in it , right here on this side .that will go for the rest of the face .
so right now we are going to learn go tell aunt rody .it is the last of the short pieces that we are going to learn today and it is another piece that you can practice in conjunction with your bowing exercises .and that completes the series and so now you can go back to the short pieces that we have already learned as well as the harmony parts. [CLS] [SEP]so if you are playing with your friends your friend can play the harmony part and you can play the first violin part or you can switch. [CLS] [SEP]and then there is a lot of variety of pieces that you can play and there are other short pieces that you can learn .in the beginning though it is good to practice these short pieces as well as the bowing exercises that we have been learning .you are going to be learning some more exercises later on in other series but for now have fun .
now when you get ready to install your drapes , you 're going to need a drill , some anchors , probably a phillips head screwdriver. [CLS] [SEP]and of course a tape measure .now when we 've chosen our curtains , most curtains are 84 inches in length and when we install the curtains , what we want to do is we want to make sure that the bottom of the curtain is flush with the floor .the only exception to that would be sheers , with sheers we usually let them pool on the floor a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]so that 's going to affect your measurements as far as your attach points .now these particular drapes here have a grommet .so what we want to do is we want to measure from the top of the curtain to the center of the grommet .in this case , it 's an inch and three quarters .so by that , i know that the center of this rod that holds this curtains up needs to be 81 and a quarter inches off the floor .and what i 've done is i 've taken the , or excuse me , 82 and a quarter. [CLS] [SEP], what i 've done is i 've taken the 84 inches. [CLS] [SEP], i 've deducted an inch and a quarter and that 's how i come up with 82 and a quarter .so knowing that i 've got to be 82 and a quarter off the center of this , then i can transfer the center of this to the bracket and in this case , on this bracket just happens to be this top attach point .so that 's how i would locate my first hole , i would locate it at 82 and a quarter inches off the floor. [CLS] [SEP]and then i would measure the distance between the other attach point , the other screw hole on the bracket , mark that , transfer that dimension to the wall , drill my hole there .now if you hit studs and what i recommend is using a small drill bit see if you hit any studs , because if you hit studs , then you can just screw the bracket right into the studs .if you do n't happen to hit studs , then you want to take a larger bit that 's recommended for an anchor and actually put anchors in there to hold your bracket securely .so basically if you just get your dimensions down right and locate your brackets right , then drapes are pretty easy to install .i 'm tim gipson in how to install drapes .
all right .let 's move on to the next focusing mode , which is the al focus mode .this mode is kind of a hybrid , or a mix , between the al servo and the one. [CLS] [SEP]shot focusing mode .basically , the al focus mode might work like this .if you had a still subject that you focused on , and you achieved that focus , the focus would be locked .but , as soon as , and the way to do that is , go ahead and put your camera in the al focus mode by pressing the af button and then scroll through here until your lcd says al focus on the right side here .you should be in that mode , and you can activate the rest of your lcd screen there by pressing the shutter button .and then go ahead and frame up your shot with your camera , and press the shutter button half way down , and the camera will focus on your subject and lock that focus down .but , if your subject or object begins to move , then the lens will automatically switch back to the al servo mode , which will allow for continuous focusing .
the first example of a neck opening that we have is the basic button down front long sleeve cuff shirt opening with a collar .this you 're probably only going to use if you do like technically specific drawings .you can use this in some of your own ideas , but i find it rather boring .it 's just a plain old shirt .so the first thing that we do is right here that you notice that it goes around the neck .you want to make sure that you have some with that dimension so that you can tell that the collar is not just two flat squares of fabric coming through down the neck .so we want to make sure we show that and swoop it .it took me forever to learn how to draw .i do n't know why , but start at the next and swoop it down .and then go along the neck line to draw your collar .you all i should have made these points touch , but whatever .and then draw your button placket , and you 're done .
all right , anytime that you play with fire , the most important thing to have on hand is a fire extinguisher .i 'm very fortunate because in this controlled environment i have several people standing at my beck and call with fire extinguishers , just in case. [CLS] [SEP], so a fire extinguisher is the most important .the second most important thing you 're going to need when your making glass beads is a pair of safety glasses. [CLS] [SEP], now these are n't just any safety glasses .they have to be certain , certainly rated ; they 're dididium so they have a coating on the glass that protects your eyes from the sodium flare .when the flame meets the glass it gives off what 's called sodium flare and prolonged exposure to that can really wreak havoc on your eyesight .another safety precaution you want to think about is clothing. [CLS] [SEP]you always want to make sure that you have jeans or some kind of twill .heavier clothing on your stomach , your chest area and also on your legs .you also want to make sure that there 's plenty of ventilation in the studio .right here i have a very open space but at my studio that i teach at. [CLS] [SEP], i have a 1600 cfm fan that draws all of the propane and oxygen gases out of my studio and sends them outside of my studio .that 's another , one more thing you want to think of is , this is called a quench jar .this is basically just a jar full of water that you can drop hot objects in when you need to .
and this is another passage .( demo )
we see the basic elements to form chinese numbers and then we have a `` ten '' .that starts a different direction. [CLS] [SEP]so it becomes two digits from there on. [CLS] [SEP]and then you can work with these basic one through nine numbers to form numbers from one to ninety-nine and. [CLS] [SEP]then from then on we need to introduce a character that 's `` bai ''which is , this is `` ten '' here , which is `` hundred '' , o.k . [CLS] [SEP]`` bai '' .horizontal , slant left , vertical , horizontal bend , horizontal , horizontal , `` bai '' .that 's `` hundred ''so it 's , once this is introduced , it 's very easy to form the numbers between one and nine hundred and ninety-nine .so you saw what i did for anything under ninety-nine. [CLS] [SEP]but now we can add a number one there. [CLS] [SEP]that means `` one hundred ''and then this means `` two hundred ''and then this means `` three hundred '' and behind that you can write `` three hundred thirty '' or `` three hundred thirty-five '' .just keep on writing that. [CLS] [SEP]and you may have a question that `` o.k . [CLS] [SEP]what if i do n't have any `` tens '' in between ? ''so it 's `` one hundred and five ''how do you write that ?and i need to introduce something .in chinese , this means , `` zero '' `` ling '' and you write it more .
and i am going to show you how to stick it in the oven .you want to get yourself a foil .completely cover your casserole dish in the foil .go over to your oven that is pre-heated at 350 degrees. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to stick it in the middle if you can .you want to leave that in there for about 30 minutes .if you want you can go ahead and check on your enchiladas in about 15 minutes. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to make sure that it is not boiling over or anything if you have. [CLS] [SEP]2 layers of enchiladas say for instance .but what you can do is leave it in there , leave it alone .if you want it to be on a higher temperature. [CLS] [SEP]i guess you can stick it on a higher temperature for less time or on a lower temperature for a lower time. [CLS] [SEP], it 's up to you .but i will use the 350 degrees for about 30 minutes and your enchiladas should come out so delicious and that is it for sticking it in the oven .
so he 's pushing forward .i shift back with that and my staff comes up underneath the chin and into the throat .this is a stabilitating strike .before he 's going back , i shift away and i strike the groin .once again .i shift back , striking up either the throat underneath the chin .i create space putting pressure here .as i step back more , i strike up into his groin .then slide out , then whole body going forward .now for real time .he attacks .
now that we 've done our continuation of our backwards columns or on the other side our upwards columns we 're going to continue to keep this pattern going on our row three .so , again you 're going to wrap your yarn around your needle .once you have this already established it just slides behind there so easily ; which of course makes it easy to continue the pattern .so , we have our three .pull it through the first two and pull it through the second two .you 'll see this is a continuant of .now , this may look a little high , but when we come in to fix our pattern to have it adjusted to go the opposite way you 'll really see that it does n't end up looking that big .now , we 're going to do it again .wrap your yarn around your needle .pull your yarn forward .we 've got our three loops .pull yarn through the first two .pull yarn through the second two ; one more time .go behind .pull it through .pull yarn through the first two loops .pull it through the second two .easy as pie .now , we 're just going to continue to keep the same pattern going until we get to the end .
rose cards are readily available .there are not a shortage of pete rose cards .if you go back into the sixties and his rookie card , you expect to pay for an average conditioned card three to four , five hundred dollars for a pete rose rookie .rose cards can be purchased for as little as twenty five cents a card and can be found at any of your hobby stores , any baseball card shows , online , and purchased from individuals .rose cards continue to sell reasonably well because he is very , very popular player .and i would recommend that you shop around for pete cards and also probably visit your local hobby shop or a national card show if one comes to your area .
and i 'm here to answer the question `` what do i do in dealing with a stalker '' ?the first thing is treat it as a very serious matter .this is an area where i would advise you to error on the side of caution , as opposed to , waiting any period of time before you report it to your local authorities .i 'd. [CLS] [SEP]rather you go to the police and advice them on of the stalker on a , what seemingly turns out not to be a stalking incident , than to miss the boat and have someone stalking you to cause you physical harm or worse .some of the things you do , in dealing with a stalker , obviously , change your phone number , carry with you , at all times , a cell phone , try not to be alone , try to keep your answering machine , tapes , letters , document the individual that you think is stocking you , so that you have evidence for later use .i 'm robert todd and thank you for watching .
hi. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm ann myrick and. [CLS] [SEP]today we are going to talk about tables .you have your normal tables as far as occasional tables , dining tables , little side tables. [CLS] [SEP]but today we are going to talk about if all of a sudden you are working on your house and you need a table. [CLS] [SEP]but you do n't have a table. [CLS] [SEP]and these are just fun ways i am a decorator. [CLS] [SEP]and i work with what people have. [CLS] [SEP]and i love making something different out of something different. [CLS] [SEP]and so this is a chair that i found like for $ 3 at a garage sale and you know people try to get this. [CLS] [SEP]and this is just naturally done. [CLS] [SEP]and i love this chair because although it is a chair i also love to use it as a side table in the bedroom and. [CLS] [SEP]another fun way would be to take the towel and put it in a fun place in your bathroom and to put let 's see this might not fit , that 's not going to fit but to put towels in the bathroom using it as a little table .you could just put a few things on it. [CLS] [SEP]and it makes a cute little table .you do n't have one. [CLS] [SEP]and so you turn the chair into one .here is another idea ,a chest works great as far as if you want , these are lower chairs. [CLS] [SEP]and so if you just want to use a little chest .i always like extra little places like a stool or chest to put a cup of coffee or a drink. [CLS] [SEP]and so this is another way you can just pull a chest up and if you had a stack of books you could put a few books on top of the chest and then there would be space for coffee or you could also tray it .you could have a neat tray and just put a tray on top of it. [CLS] [SEP]and then your books on that .another way is just take a , if you have a big book collection like coffee table books. [CLS] [SEP]you could stack , i love stacking books really high in a neat pile and using it for a table .i 'm ann myrick and those are ways to decorate with tables that are n't tables .
in a case like this where there are just dead leaves and things in the surface , what you can do is just scrap it back and make sure that you ’ re creating a good wide ring around the fire of non-burnable soil and stuff that ’ s not going to catch on fire if a flame does jump out of the fire .you can pretty easily do that , the green stuff is not as likely to burn so that ’ s not as much of an issue .again , in a well used fire area in a place where you ’ re reusing an existing fire pit , this probably already been done and you probably already have a nice clear unburnable area around the fire .once you ’ ve cleared the area around the fire make sure you also store your firewood far enough from the fire , that that doesn ’ t catch and you ’ ll want to make sure that you keep that a good distance away from the fire .so again there ’ s not an opportunity for the fire to leap out of the campfire ring and catch your fuel wood on fire .
okay , let 's continue on with our realistic fire text .as we can see here , we 've got a lot of lines going on here so what i want to do is soften this out a little bit .let 's go to filter and let 's go to blur .i 'm going to go to blur. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll give this a gaussian blur .just a little bit of an effect here to knock down the hardness of all that .let 's do something like , let 's do something like that .that looks pretty good .we 're going to go ahead and hit okay on that .what we 're going to do is we 're just going to go ahead and grab this and copy this layer down and as we do that , we 're going to turn one of them off , like so .and with this layer right here , let 's change this layer to overlay , like so and we 'll go ahead and turn our fire copy back on below it .and let 's go ahead and hit filter and let 's say , let 's distort .let 's just go ahead and ripple it , like so .let 's leave it on medium ripples and we 'll say 100 % sounds good .as you can see here we have a little bit going on , like so .and , actually , you know what ?let 's do that again .let 's hit command f.let 's do it again .we can do it quite a few times till i get something .that 's pretty good .that 's what i want here .so i 'm going to grab that layer. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to grab the layer below it. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm gon. [CLS] [SEP]na just go image. [CLS] [SEP]or i 'm sorry , layer and merge layers , like so .and look at that .we 've got a little flame text going on already .so we 're going to stop here. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll pick this up in the next part .
so , here on out , we 've already finished up with our basil , redskin mashed potatoes --so , so good ; light , fluffy .added a little bit of fresh roasted garlic in there .next , we 're going on to our citrus-sage sauce , which is extremely good .i 've taken the liberty of adding shallots , garlic , white wine , reduce it down , drop some orange zest up in there and then finally , come back with our roasted shrimp shells that we 've had in the oven for , probably about like 15 or 20 minutes , just to kinda bring out that flavor .if you have shell-food allergies , stay away , stay away .so , we 're then going to lower our heat a little bit. [CLS] [SEP], kind of let this drop down .it smells so good .so there it is right there .that 's our stock .we have our basil , red-skin mashed potatoes ready .the next thing , you know what it is -- bacon wrapped scallops , proscuitto wrapped scallops .
what your going to do pop it just like an ollie. [CLS] [SEP]and when you slide your foot up you go off the edge. [CLS] [SEP]and you flick right about there where the concave is .and this will pop the board in the air send it flipping and what you want to do is want to catch it and land on the bolts .
i want to talk about when it 's a good idea to play a draw .it 's five card draw poker , we can play draw sometimes .okay , here 's the thing .if you are drawing to a card that , if you 're only drawing to one card and you 're playing the high round .say you 've got a straight that can be completed by a middle card , that 's called a gut shot straight draw .the math is rarely going to be right to draw to that .you need to be getting , like , eleven to one return on your call .okay ?now , let 's talk about an open ended straight draw .open ended means you can catch a card at either end .so , look at this hand .queen , jack , ten , nine , and. [CLS] [SEP]then there 's this seven .you 'd be throwing away that seven and hoping to draw an eight or a king .now , the math on that is such that , if you 're getting a five to one return on your call , then you 're good to draw .so , make sure you do the math. [CLS] [SEP]right .and then , with regard to low hands .if you 're playing in a fixed limit game , you can always call to try to go for an eight low .you 'd be throwing away that queen , and you 'd be going for an eight low .if you 're playing in a pot limit or no limit game , and there 's a large bet to you ,do n't go calling when you do n't already have a made eight low or better .
alright , so we 're going to finish off sherry 's eye with a little mascara .and what i 'm going to do with this is , i definitely want to give her a lot of volume , because she 's got some really beautiful eyes going on here .so , go ahead and look down , and i 'm going to take this mascara right from the base of her lash , and just totally pull it out .and i may even give her two coats , because i want to give her some really thick lashes .but like i said , i 'm going to start from the base of the lash , and i 'm sort of using a sawing motion back and forth .i 'm going to move my brush back and forth because that 's really going to grab the lash as i 'm moving to the outer edge of the lash .another thing i 'm going to do too is also go from inside as well , or you know , on the backside of the lash , and that 's going to grab it from back there as well .so , it 's totally going to coat the lash and make it jet black .and especially for a smoky eye , that is something really , really pretty .so , let 's start on the other eye here , get a little bit more color , i 'm going to dip my tube , or my wand back in to the tube .and go ahead and look down , and once again , i 'm going to start from the base and pull out , getting from behind the lash as well .and of course , when you 're doing your mascara at home , you do n't have to look down like this , but this is a great way to do it on someone else , because i do n't want to poke her in the eye .so , when i 'm ready to do the lashes on the bottom , i 'm actually not going to stick my wand back in to the tube. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm sort of just going to use the leftovers on the wand because your lashes down below are so much thinner , that it 's just going to be too much .so , i 'm just going to use the same wand. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm not dipping it back in , and i 'm just going to blend right below .and you can see , it 's just going to give her a little bit more definition , go ahead and look up a little bit , there you go , but it 's not overboard .and there you go .
o.k .so what we 're going to do here. [CLS] [SEP], we 're going to go ahead and start with a stretching techniques .first we 're going to start with a very basic arm stretch .we 're going to go ahead and go across .we 're going to just hold on to it , for about five seconds .same thing with the other side .we 're going to go ahead and let 's start from the back .now when you go in the back , you 're going to go ahead and swing your arm .cut in at the elbow and bend .it 's very important to that , so we 're going ahead to do our strikes .and when you make these strikes , you 're going to have good flexibility .you can not be flexible , if you do not stretch .do n't take that for granted .everyday stretch , even if you 're not training .now we 're going to go ahead and put one foot down .move forward .now in this one , it 's not good enough to go ahead and cheat .and not bend the front leg .you have to bend the first one .and the back leg , keep it perfectly straight .i 'm going to go ahead and switch to the other side .now what we 're doing , we 're now working the calves .but now we 'll go ahead and work out the front side of the legs .we 're going to stretch it out .and the same thing with the other side .and that 's the way to start off , the class .
hi my name is madeline franco. [CLS] [SEP]and i am here to talk about birds , specifically parrots and more specifically than that different species of parrots .there are well over 300 different species of parrots in the world .some are called old world parrots which hale from africa , australia , and. [CLS] [SEP]points west of the united states and others are new world parrots primarily from south and central america .many of the parrots from old word are called cockatoos and. [CLS] [SEP]you 've seen them. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]sure .they are white in color , many of them , some of them are black and some of them are pink .the pink ones are even known as white cockatoos because anything other than black seems to be white .the south american birds and central american birds tend to be rather colorful .the african parrots by in large a lot of them are fairly dull in color such as the african gray and the vosa parrot .many of these are suitable as pets and a lot of them are found in our culture .this over here is a kiek .this is kiki .she is a kiek .they are from south america .she is a small parrot , very suitable as a pet .she lives to play and plays to live and a very companionable little bird .these are old world parrots from the solomon islands primarily indonesia and this is the male of the eclectus parrot and that is the female .these are dimorphic .other birds , the typical parrot is a , the typical parrot that you see with the long tail is from south american primarily and central america and they are macaws .this here is a parrot that at one time was indigenous to the western united states .they are having a hard time surviving there though because of the predator population .they are found in the sierras of mexico and it is called a thick built parrot .you can not buy one of these .this one was given to me as a gift because i do presentations at schools and a friend of mine gave me this bird .it is a wonderful little bird. [CLS] [SEP]but again they are not available in aviculture because they are restricted .many of the parrots that we see today are endangered in their environment , their natural environments but they are bred widely in aviculture and. [CLS] [SEP]in many instances aviculture is help keeping those species alive .several of them have actually dwindled to frightening numbers in their natural environment due to deforestation. [CLS] [SEP]and i guess you would call it encroachment by man .but hopefully we 've got some good conservation programs going and many of them will increase in numbers .we have had great success with the blue throated macaw and some of the other birds that used to be and still are quite endangered but they are coming around .if you are considering getting a parrot , i would suggest that you get a book or do a lot of studying before you make that decision .it is a big decision to have a bird as a pet , a parrot as a pet .they are long lived .it is not uncommon for them to live 30 to 50 years in captivity so they are a lot of fun .they are very intelligent , long lived and they make great pets. [CLS] [SEP]but it is a major responsibility when you decide to have one .
now , okay , remember in melodic minor scale , okay , you go up in the melodic formation with those fingerings , with everything i showed you .but , when you go down in the scale , okay .you play a natural minor scale .alright .so let 's try going down in the scale .let 's start on our fourth finger a natural .ready ?instead of a g sharp , it 's going to be g natural .instead of f sharp , it 's going to be f natural .instead of e natural , it 's going to be e flat .d. [CLS] [SEP]natural , instead that now we play with. [CLS] [SEP]an open string cause we 're going the other way .c. [CLS] [SEP]natural , b flat , instead of b. [CLS] [SEP]natural and ...
in this clip i 'm going to be talking about if your model would like to incorporate a hand being casted into the belly cast .typically it is best if an adult does this ; meaning an adult hand being placed on the belly .children ca n't sit still that long ; to have their hands casted into mama 's belly .so , if you have your husband or significant other ; wants to stand behind you and put his hands on your belly , or if you want to put your hands on your belly that is perfectly fine .just try and steer away from kids .jewelry , if you 're wearing jewelry it 's best if you take the jewelry off .it wo n't really be seen when you cast over it and the plaster can get in the jewelry , so make sure you take that precaution .you want to make sure that you vaseline the whole area that will be casted .that may mean up to , you know , a quarter of your arm .the placement of the hand is important .if you 're casting half way down your belly the hand should be underneath the previous laid strip .you do n't want to place a hand over plaster that has already been laid and smoothed out .that will make it much more difficult to remove the cast .this has been how to prepare to incorporate hands into a belly casting .
this combination takes the mambo from the top .remember 2 little half semi circle turns with double knee. [CLS] [SEP]there 's your 16 counts , shuffle just rock forward and back and then go to a little l step of your choice .mambo from the top , down , down all the way around , double knee , shuffle ,rock add your pivot and a little l step .the counts are down on three come around mambo down come all the way around , double knee , shuffle rock , rock pivot , l step .again mambo 1 2 3. [CLS] [SEP]so i called mambo 3 and 6 double knee , shuffle rock and l.last time mambo from the top you 're going down on 3 and 6 all the way around pretty complex move pretty advanced .but also i lot of fun and finish with your l step .
this is your typical piece of baseboard right here .and basically what you would need to do. [CLS] [SEP]is you need to measure the wall area that you need your baseboard .if you 're putting baseboard in an entire house , you 'll measure the wall area from corner to door and , or corner to corner , and you 'll add up all your wall area. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 'll want to add ten percent for the waste .now what you 'll do once you get your baseboard in , make sure that your pieces are straight and not warped and you do n't want them to be swollen , crooked ,anything like that .you want them to be as straight as you can possibly get them .typically you can get pre-primed pieces like this , or you can get the bare wood pieces .i prefer to use pre-primed just because it saves you a step when you 're ready to paint .so the first thing you 're going to do is you 're going to measure the wall that you want your baseboard on .you should already have your casing around all the doors and all the windows , and what you 'll do is you 'll measure from the corner of the room to the other corner , or from the corner to the casing on the door .and once you get that measurement , you 'll want to measure it on your piece of baseboard like this , and then you 'll put a mark .you 'll want to cut that piece at that mark and the piece , if it 's against a piece of casing , it would be a square cut .just a straight cut straight across and it would butt right up to the casing .but if you 're on an inside corner , you 'll have to miter the edge of it like this .you 'll have to angle a miter in , that way the other piece can be mitered and match up in that corner .if it 's on an outside corner , you 'll have to miter it out like this .that way as it comes around the wall when you miter the other one at that same forty-five degree angle , they 'll meet up here and give you a nice edge .once you put your baseboard up , you can probably nail it .you 'll want to use an eighteen gage nail , sixteen gage nail , something that 's fairly small .that way you do n't have a big hole in your baseboard .also you need to know if you 're going to put shoe molding on , you attach the shoe molding to the baseboard , not to the floor .my name 's ryan parker , parker home renovations , and you can contact me at parkerhomerenovations.com .
now i 'm going to show you how to make a two-toned poncho .one layer of fabric with some pretty colored trims .what we 'll need for this project is two pieces of a coordinating fabric , measuring thirty-six inches by twenty-one inches .i 've chosen the dark purple and the light purple .then you 'd want some coordinating colors to , to do the trim .and i 've chosen four different coordinating colors in strips of one inch , by about a yard and a half .you 'll need some nice sharp scissors , some pins , and a ruler .to begin our two-toned fleece poncho , you want to take your two pieces of thirty-six inch by twenty-one inch fleece fabric and place them together with the wrong sides together .you want the wrong sides together on the inside. [CLS] [SEP]and then the right side of the fabric will be facing the outside .okay , you want to place those together , line them up exactly even and together , and then we 're going to be cutting a row of fringe right down the side of those two pieces of fabric .so we 're going to be cutting a three inch fringe .so you want to measure and mark .i 'm marking with some pins .just put some pins in at three inches all the way along the edge .okay , and you just put a pin in , place your ruler here , three inches , and just put some pins to mark that all the way down the edge of the two pieces of fleece .next we 're going to cut a fringe .we 're going to cut starting at the end here .we 're going to cut a three quarter inch fringe all the way to that three inch marking .and you cut this fringe all the way down , along this edge , just one side , cutting through both layers of the fabric .they do n't have to be perfectly three inches .you want them to stay in the general ball park .the fleece fabric is very forgiving , and even if you make little mistakes , you 're not going to notice it by the time you 've knotted the fringe and the fringe kind of flops around anyway .so you do n't have to be concerned if your cutting is n't perfectly straight , or you do n't go exactly ,exactly three inches .just continue cutting down and do the whole edge , about three inches long and about three quarter inches wide .
i 've been doing construction for many years and i want to talk about soft woods .there are a few different soft woods used in construction and pine is one of the most common for exterior siding over the years in turns this beautiful gray and it used to be the fancy way to do new york city apartments in what they called barn board , basically gray pine .before it is gray it is brand new pine .over the years that will turn this way .pine is reasonably soft and not that strong for structural members .when you go with structural members as in 2x6 's there is spruce. [CLS] [SEP], there is hemlock and there is fur .they are similar .spruce is actually the strongest but tends to turn a little bit and hemlock we used to do a lot of home grown hemlock here. [CLS] [SEP]and it is not as strong as spruce. [CLS] [SEP]but it is very strong and fur comes from the west coast .those are your framing timbers , roof rafters , studs , joists .southern yellow pine is very strong .it is used to make pressure treated wood , anything in the ground sills , it gets the greenest tinge and it is a very very very strong softwood .it is harder than some hard woods and it 's main purpose is actually stair treads and pressure treated .if you do n't like pressure treated , ceder , ceder is a beautiful , beautiful wood that is very resistant to rot .this is red ceder used for decks , railings , very soft but it will last for a long time .the white ceder is not quite as high quality and you tend to get more knots in it. [CLS] [SEP]but it is still a ceder that is going to last you for a long time .so these are the main soft woods that we use in your building trades .i 'm robert markey and we 've been talking about soft woods .
i 've been a carpenter for a long time and we 're going to talk about how to use a scroll saw .the first issue is how narrow a curve. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going cut with this which will allow you to determine which blade .this is a pretty average size blade , with blade it 'll cut pretty good , a pretty good curve .o.k. [CLS] [SEP], you can get much thinner than that , you can use a narrower blade .it makes a lot of noise , put your earphones on , make sure this is clamped .and there it is .as long as this is securely clamped and your curve is not too small for your blade , we 're good .i 'm robert markey and. [CLS] [SEP]we 've been talking about using a scroll saw .
in this clip , we going to talk about a very important rhythm called kuku .kuku is a very popular with them .they play it almost all over africa , in all parties and to make people dance .so let 's start with the signal .the signal is what you do before you start playing the drum .the leader do the signal and everybody follows .so , the signal if i have to do it with my mouth goes .so let 's do it with the hand. [CLS] [SEP]and you will understand .that 's the wait for kuku .let me do it again , so follow. [CLS] [SEP]so you can repeat it .okay ?it 's one , two , three , four .that 's , they call that a signal .if you do n't hear this , you do n't start playing and also it serves to stop the rhythm when people are playing together .
in most forms of solitaire there 's a point that you can come to mid hand , if you will , that you 'll realize ,oh , i 'm not going to win this hand .i might get a good score , i might get down close. [CLS] [SEP]but i 'm not going to win this hand .now we 've created a microcosm , if you will , of what the tableau , of a portion of the tableau for fourteens in a situation where you can realize no dice on this given hand .and what we have are four columns , a little portion of the tableau. [CLS] [SEP]and we 've got some columns that are in decent shape. [CLS] [SEP]and then these two that are not .and the situation is a king needs an ace to make fourteen .but these two kings have all the combinations locked up behind them .the fact that you ca n't play a column on itself. [CLS] [SEP], i ca n't play this king with this ace because they 're stacked on top of each other .and the fact that these two kings are side by side with all the rest of the aces and kings locked behind them show that i will not win this given hand .and from time to time you 'll have similar situations when you play fourteens .and you 'll have to say ,oh well , no win this time around .
this is the most common type of solitaire and anybody who 's played solitaire on their microsoft computer has probably known this one .anyway you start off with a regular deck of cards which usually you shuffle .place one card face up and. [CLS] [SEP]then six cards face down .face up and then the rest face down .so face down .so once you 've done that you have a couple of different options , the most common way that people play is to take three cards at a time and flip them over .now the point is to get all the cards up at the top , but in order to get them at the top you need to have an ace .other then that the only other rule is that you can stack cards if it is the opposite suite .or the opposite color .so for example , black jack , on red queen .then you can flip up the card underneath .i 've got a choice here between two tens .i like to take the pile that has the fewest number of cards because it gives me some more flexibility later on .but that again is a personal choice .you just keep flipping .usually you are allowed to go through this deck as many times as you want to .however , originally when this game was played for money , people would have only three chances to go through the deck .the idea was that you paid fifty two dollars for the deck and for every card you got up. [CLS] [SEP]you got five dollars back .people usually did n't get their money back .this is going to be a short game .anyway win or lose. [CLS] [SEP]that 's how you play solitaire .
alright , let 's make a shot .what we 're going to do here is we 're going to attempt to pocket this ball in the corner pocket using all the techniques that we 've talked about thus far .so we 're going to go with our four step set up , where as we just step into it , get in alignment .now , what we have to start doing is as we get down. [CLS] [SEP]there is , we 've got our contact point identified , now we have to get our cue ball from this point to that point. [CLS] [SEP]so it hits that contact point exactly .well the best way to do that is by , as you ?re down here in your stance you might be making minute adjustment .you do n't want to make anything major once you 're down on the shot , because if things are n't set up well enough for you to perform the shot while your down there , if it does n't feel right to you , you need to stand up , start all over again , get down to where you are relatively in line , that everything is balanced and comfortable to you .so when you 're there , now you start alternating your focus from the cue ball to the object ball , back to the cue ball or back to the object ball , back to the cue ball , alternating thusly .so that you 're looking at your contact point on the object ball , back to the cue ball , and you 're taking your warm up strokes , and while you ?re doing that your shifting your gaze back and forth , and then on the last stroke you want to be looking at that point on the object ball , to stroke through the cue ball , and pocket the object ball .
we 'll now look at how to pack your gear for teleprompters .many teleprompter package systems come with shipping cases .generally , you will pay more for that perk , but they are usually nice because they are designed for that particular system .i 've always had my cases designed for my particular needs .i 'm now using bright yellow cases with lots of foam on the inside to protect my sensitive equipment .i can see the yellow cases a mile away at baggage claim .also i highly recommend getting a nice folding cart like this one .it 's adjustable for your various cases .if you do n't have a cart , you may be hand carrying heavy cases a long way .carts can also serve as a table .once you have emptied your cases and set up , you can use your cases as a table top for your laptop .also i 've found that you really should hand carry your laptops and there are a lot of types of soft and hard cases available .make sure you have your own power strip , stingers or extension cords , bnc and vga cables that attach to your computer and then to your monitors , lots of adapters , screws , black gaffer 's tape and dubatine cloth is always handy .also i 've found that a usb plug in light or a table light is very necessary for the job .
now i 'm going to show you how to replace your trombone slide bumper .first of all , there 's numerous reasons why they would go bad , from normal wear and tear .hit it on something and bend your bumper , which can definitely effect the integrity of the bumper material .this one as you can see is definitely torn , so we want to go ahead and take our little pliers and remove that off of there .then inspect it and make sure everything is okay , and we 've found ourselves a new bumper here which you can find at any repair shop .you might even be able to find that at the hardware store .but this is pretty self explanatory , just put the bumper down on the end there .and if you think that it might fall off , if it 's a little bit loose feel free to put a little bit of hot glue or something under there to keep it in place .but it 's very important that you have that on there. [CLS] [SEP]so it prevents damage of your hand slide crook .and that 's how to replace a hand slide bumper .
choosing a diet or weight loss program can be overwhelming .there are so many claims out there , so many diets , so many fad diets. [CLS] [SEP], what 's the next best thing .how do you choose what 's right and evaluate it effectively ?this is alice monsaert with some tips for you on just how to do that .if you see a diet that makes a claim that you can lose 30 pounds in 30 days be aware .if you see a diet or weight loss plan that eliminates one food group such as carbohydrates , be aware .proper nutrition involves taking in enough calories and taking in those calories from all three food groups which includes carbohydrates , fats , and proteins .realistic weight loss is about a pound to maybe a pound and a half a week. [CLS] [SEP]so those claims out there that say take this pill and lose 30 pounds in 30 days are too good to be true .you really need to seek the advice of perhaps a personal trainer or a dietitian to help you with your weight loss goals .it is a daunting process .in real life it actually is pretty simple to do , stay away from all of the claims that say this is easy .it is not easy .it takes day after day of diligent work to make sure that you are ingesting the right amount of proteins , carbohydrates and fats to get the calories that your body needs to function daily .so choose wisely and seek the advice of a professional. [CLS] [SEP]should you need more help .
in this example i 'm going to do another like , kind of heavy rock riff in a and some more reminiscent of the eighties type rock , but as i mentioned before there has been kind of a resurgence of the influence in today ?s rock and what i 'm going to do here is a riff in a and so with the drums it will sound like this .what i did there was. [CLS] [SEP]just simply did an a 5.yeah , just going one , two , three , four , one , two , three , four. [CLS] [SEP]it 's an eighth note. [CLS] [SEP]so .and you know what that gives us is kind of a nice solid foundation you know. [CLS] [SEP]riding the a and , often times the bass player would simply just be riding an a.it 's good to set up for either like a solo section , you know where the guitar player can rip or either that. [CLS] [SEP]or just a nice ballsy sounding rock sound for a verse .
it 's about 3 feet high , and it 's picked 4 times to 5 times most through out the year .and it starts in the early spring , about april or so , depending again on the weather pattern .and that specific tea is called sincha , very first picking of the year .and that style type of tea , only lasts about 7 to 10 days max .after that they have another picking , and that style tea is called sencha .most of the tea consumed in japan is called sencha .and they also export it to over seas , is the style of sencha .because the japanese drink so much green tea , that they have to import from china a sencha tea .so what they do is they ask their chinese counterpart to produce a tea that 's made the way they do .and what the japanese do , is after they pick their tea leaves , they steam the tea leaves , increasing the corafil .therefore , when you look at a japanese green tea , it is greener than chinese green tea .from the sencha the leader picking is called bancha , and what they do is they take the bancha. [CLS] [SEP]and they roast it. [CLS] [SEP], it 's called a hojicha , which is a roasted tea .and the bancha as well they add rice kernels , and they call that genmaicha , which is made from , again the same style tea. [CLS] [SEP], it 's just when it 's picked .therefore when you think of japanese green tea , it 's one basic style of tea that has been manipulated to create the different styles , the different flavors of japanese green tea .
so you have to make adjustments there .this is another little trick that i got for you that is going to save you money and hassle about looking for parts .what you are going to do is you are going to cut off the last inch of your tube .so we will do that very quickly .wow that was fast .now we have got our end tube-a-ring and the rest of our tube and what we are going to use this for is our lenses by putting our transparencies on each side of it and creating our end cap .i will show you how to do that next .
one of the jump ropes i 'm going to be talking about today is the general plastic , we call them plastic type nylon jump rope .most of them are equipped with a ball bearing type swivel at the very end so that makes them a little bit faster and the jump rope itself does n't get balled up inside the handle .these are also adjustable if you decide that a nine foot one is too long for your average boxer , most of your boxers .you can actually shorten it by passing the jump rope back through it , through the handle itself and there 's usually a net or a wire coupling on there that you can actually cut and then reattach. [CLS] [SEP]so you 'll get a little bit shorter jump rope .once you shorter a jump rope , that 's as short as it 's going to be. [CLS] [SEP]and there 's no way of lengthening them .the plastic jump rope sometimes is a little bit fast for your beginners .you 'll see , if you look at some of the beginners sometimes , they 'll come in and the jump rope will be so fast that by the time they jump , they 've already passed it back around again and they 're hitting themselves in the ankles the second time around before they get a chance to jump again .so keep an eye on your beginners and tell them right away if the jump rope is a little bit fast for them , we 'll go with a little bit slower rope. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll talk about that in just a moment .
there are three vegetables in our recipe for the acorn tagine .there is acorn squash , red pepper , and red onion .when you are choosing the vegetables , look for things that are unblemished .when you bring them home , make sure you take the labels off and wash off any excess dirt or sand .the other thing you will need is a good cutting board , and a nice chef 's knife , along with a paring knife and a spoon to clean out the squash .
when you 're going to install a full system on a bike like this , the first thing you need to do after you take all the plastics off is you have to loosen the radiator support and push the radiator forward , which will allow to get into the header bolts , and once you get the header bolts off , you 'll eliminate the header pipe , the butterfly valve , the collector right here , and the rear muffler .so , once we get all that off , we 'll get everything cleaned up , we 'll head and get the oil changed , and then , we 'll put the brand new pipe back on .right now , i 'm removing the header bolts , the bolts that hold the header on , and once i get those off , this thing will come right off .all right , now that we got the header bolts all taken out , we 're going to go ahead and drop these few bolts , take the butterfly valve , and the exhaust should just come right off .you 're just going to release these cables right here .here 's the butterfly valve .there we go .and basically , this is the whole factory exhaust .until you remove , just take all the bolts out , slide it right out , and we 'll change the oil really quickly , and we 'll get the new one locked up and ready .
okay , so in this tutorial we 're going to move on. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to actually teach you how to use the gamut warning a little bit better and. [CLS] [SEP]on this clip i 'm going to show you what to do .so , what you want to do is go down to your layers palette. [CLS] [SEP]like we have done earlier. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to click that little half moon looking thing .and we 're going to select the hue and saturation .okay , now what you want to do is want to unlock the eyedroppers once again. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to actually click up here on the edit menu .and as you can see down on my picture , i zoom in .the green in the grass is actually what 's oversaturated .so , i 'm going to hit greens .so , now it unlocked the eyedroppers for us and our green. [CLS] [SEP]is actually selected right down here , but we want to actually select the exact green .and there also , let me show you right over here on this. [CLS] [SEP], you can see right here on this board , this wood that 's on the sign .that 's a little oversaturated as well .probably with a red .looks like it to me at least .so , basically that 's it for this tutorial .i just wanted to show you about bringing up the saturation dialog box and using the gamut warning and we 're going to move on to the next clip. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to show you how to actually drop the saturation and help your picture look a lot better in prints .
in this clip we 're going to talk about miter cuts .let 's take a look at the circular saw , again making sure it 's unplugged for safety .with this adjustment , we can change the angle of the base plate , in this case we 're going to , it usually has a stop at , there you go ,forty-five degrees .this way if you , if you make two forty-five degree cuts , you can make a nice corner on say , a hand rail or something on your deck .so let ?s go ahead and clamp up a piece of wood and take a shot at it .again , be mindful of binding .if you feel the saw starting to bind , stop .plug it back in and. [CLS] [SEP]with our base plate set at forty-five degrees , let 's make a cut .you might notice that it did n't cut all the way through. [CLS] [SEP], that 's okay .
so put the head inside of the water , take the bubbles out and then get the head out and take the air .so bubbles in the water and take in air .
all right .well , now we 're ready to get started .we 've talked about the structure of the song , we talked about the general feel of the song , we 're going to write more of a texas country song .`` texas '' is more specifically a love ballad country song , it has a texas twist , and we are in our zone , we have our texas flag , we have our cowboy hat. [CLS] [SEP], we have our cowboy boots , we 're here and we 're ready to write a country song .so now , the first thing we need to approach is the verse .what is the purpose of the verse in a country song ?now , a prevalent theme , and some of it happens within country music , is the idea of storytelling .storytelling is a big part of country music .it has been since its inception .johnny cash is a great storyteller .all those guys were great storytellers and they just decided to put it to music .willie nelson , a great storyteller .so , the purpose of the verse within a country song is to begin and tell the story .now , this story , it can be from your own perspective and you can be the main character within the song or you can be telling a story about somebody else .in this one , i 'm the main character of the song .i 'm lonely. [CLS] [SEP]and i wish the girl who live in houston is with me .so , i start to describe just the different things around me , start to describe the scene and set up the story and tell the story through the verse , and that is the purpose of the verse in country music .
okay now i 'm going to demonstrate how to prepare your bat for the clay to go on to it .we want to put the bat on to the wheel with these little pins here .and these pins are on the wheel and they go through those wing nuts on the bottom .we just want to secure the bat on to our wheel , like so .now you can see we 've had these lumps of clay sitting here slightly damp on this bat , however often times we 'll have a bat which fresh off the rack. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to be dry .or you will have just used it. [CLS] [SEP], it 's going to be real wet .you want it dry but not , you want a little bit of moisture on there , but you do n't want it wet .if it 's too dry. [CLS] [SEP]the clay wo n't stick to it , and you 'll slap it down , and you 'll start centering , and it will just move off on you .if it 's too wet , it will just move on the water and do the same thing .so we want something that 's fairly dried out , with some moisture on it .so i like to take a sponge and just wet down the area where the clay is going to stick .then i like to take my towel and just dry it off , and now you can see we have moisture on the bat , but it is not wet , soaking wet .now we 're ready to actually attach the clay to the bat , and what we 're going to do for this , is just kind of line it up in the middle .and see where it is , obviously we do n't want it off center , it 's going to make it harder to throw our two part vase .so we 're just going to line it up like this .and then we 're going to take it , slap it down , so. [CLS] [SEP]it 's almost on the middle .now with a larger piece of clay like this , it 's often times good to take a little excess clay that you may have and just stick down the edges of your bat .so that when you 're throwing your pot your bat wo n't come off the wheel and ruin your project .and this is always a good thing to do when you 're throwing large lumps of clay with bats .okay. [CLS] [SEP]so now we 've prepared the bat. [CLS] [SEP], we 've secured the clay , and we 're ready to start centering .and we 're going to do that in the next segment .
okay , now to continue where we were :when you toss the ball , now i 'm on the deuce side .so , let 's say i want to hit a serve out wide to my opponent 's forehand. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's called a slice serve .i most like am going to toss the ball more to my right. [CLS] [SEP]so i can hit the ball on the side and slice it .now that 's more of a tosp and toss and this is a slice .so , that way i pull my opponent out wide .it 's not going to be as powerful of a serve , because i do n't have as much topspin on the ball to bring it down .so , when you watch andy roddick hit a hundred forty mile an hour. [CLS] [SEP]serve , he 's got topspin on it and that 'll ; that 's what brings the ball down. [CLS] [SEP]so it lands in .so , to recap , if i want to hit a slice serve , i toss the ball more to my right. [CLS] [SEP]and i hit the ball with more of a slicing motion and if i want to hit a first serve , i 'm going to toss the ball more in front. [CLS] [SEP]and if i want to hit a second serve ; more over my head .and that 's how you move the ball around .but you 've got to hit a lot of balls to develop this type of touch and feel where you can hit the ball virtually where you want it every time .
now i 'm going to dial this barrel adjuster in all the way because when you put on new housing your cables do stretch out and bed in , so it 's good to be able to take up that slack .feeding through , i 've hit a little bit of a snag right here , so , there we go .through smooth , clean , and clear .put that farrell back on the end there .so , the first one is seated , now i need to find the second piece of housing .this bike has three individual runs of housing .one from the handle bar to right there , one from right here to right here to compensate for the movement of the suspension , and then one piece down there .the downhill bike over there has a continuous housing loop all the way from the derailer up to the handle bars .and that is because of just the mucky conditions that you can be forced to ride in and stuff like that .it makes you have to change cables due to contamination less frequently , which is a mechanic 's dream .but you know housings a lot heavier than just a cable .so , on xc bikes like this , we try to avoid doing that to save weight .although some folks who ride in really adverse conditions tend to run full cables of housing on everything just by zip tying full pieces to the frame .so you can see there 's a little indentation on the derailer. [CLS] [SEP], that means the shift cable is designed to go there .i 'm gon na line it up , gon na take my five millimeter allen wrench and torque this up pretty good .
here 's some ways you can do to prevent that ; make sure you keep tabs on exactly whose coming to your party .also keep general track whether or not they think they can invite friends , maybe be explicit maybe they can bring one friend or two no more than that .and those friends can not bring anybody else especially if you have a smaller house or smaller place , where you 're holding the party you do n't want to be jammed totally wadded up in there with about 80 people .that 's not a fun time for you , the other thing to keep in mind is party crashers , these can be people that were not originally invited but decide to crash the party .so you want to make sure and try to hold these people off especially if they have been drinking or doing who knows what you do n't want those folks at your party .it ruins your party and it 's not a fun time. [CLS] [SEP]remember it 's your house. [CLS] [SEP]you have a right to let anybody to tell anybody whose at a party of yours held at your own personal residence till they leave. [CLS] [SEP]and they have to. [CLS] [SEP]and you can certainly prevent people from coming at all .
okay , what would you check these chemicals with ?and what we 're going to do is we 're going to check the ph balance and by the way. [CLS] [SEP], ph means potential of hydrogen .how much hydrogen is in these ?and what you can do is one way you can check. [CLS] [SEP]is litmus paper and you might notice this. [CLS] [SEP], it 's kind of from how you would check your pool acid .litmus paper is made out of something that 's so completely natural .and what it is , is it actually tells you some indicators on the top here .but , it 's a plant that 's actually found in south america. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's called the. [CLS] [SEP], the plant is called the rocella tinctoria .if you can even pronounce that .and actually it 's found in different places , but mainly it 's found in south america .and that 's one way to check for the acidity base where you would put this into one of these. [CLS] [SEP]and then it would give you a color indicator .what we 're going to do is that , if this is not available to you and this is not readily available to everybody , you can make your own indicator and that 's out of cabbages , red cabbages that is .so that 's what we 're going to do next is make our own indicator .
so you just get home from ice fishing ; your cold , you ’ re hungry ; all you want to do is change your clothes , sit down on the couch. [CLS] [SEP]but you need to think about your equipment and you need to take care of your equipment or it 's not going to be there for when you need it .one of the things that i always do with tip ups ; when i get back to the house , i 'll take her ; i 'll take a rag , i 'll clean them all off ; i 'll make sure that the screws and the wings nuts are working properly , lubricate them with a little wd-40 if i need to .take out the flag ; wipe that all down so that moisture does n't accumulate and it does n't rust .i 'll , i 'll wipe down the reel ; check maybe the first 20 feet of the line for , for hooks or frays and then always ; always what you want to do is to set these up like so , put the flag side down and simply lean them up against a wall or a corner to allow this squid line to dry .you want it to be fully dry before the next time you go out so that there 's , there 's no ; that no rot builds up on it .
in soccer , sometimes it 's needed for you to be able to use many different parts of your foot .by doing a rainbow kick , you have to use both the inside of one foot , and the heel of your other .a rainbow kick in soccer would be used ,let 's say if you were trapped in a corner and could n't get out , by dribbling , passing , for finding some other means of getting through your defenders .by using the rainbow , you 'll be able to flick the ball over your head and maybe even possibly over the defender -- over the head of a defender .when doing a rainbow kick , the ball stays in between your legs , comes -- you pull it up with one foot , and then you flick it with your heel over your head .i 'll demonstrate by just showing you how it would be done .you pull the ball up with your left foot , if you 're going to flick it with your right .so you pull the ball up , and flick it with the heel on your right foot over your head .and that 's just how you 'd do a rainbow kick .
so the first move is the glide based on the heel toe turn in , turn out as i showed you a lesson before .so we start turn out right leg on the heel , left leg on the toe. [CLS] [SEP], we switch turn in and heel toe and turn out , heel toe , turn in heel toe , turn out , heel toe turn in , heel toe turn out .you can go back heel toe and turn in , heel toe and turn out , and you can actually travel if you know how to pop you can add some pop into it .just travel basic gliding .now another move you want to try is the top rock gliding , it 's like the basic kick ball change top rock. [CLS] [SEP]but you add the glide .so what i 'm going to do i 'm going to flex my left leg and at the same time i 'm going to jump on my right. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's kick , turn in turn out , kick my right leg turn in turn out , once again , kick in out , kick in out , kick in out. [CLS] [SEP], that 's the top rock gliding .
supplies that you 'll want to use to create a really pretty sun-kissed look are a foundation primer this just helps in overall wear ability in application of your foundation .we 're going to use an oil-free liquid foundation .we are going to use some bronzer .a really nice peachy tone of blush and we 're going to set that all off with some shimmer powder .we are going to use , of course , an eye shadow primer to help the eyeshadow stay on a lot better .we 're going to use a nice gold and a soft taupe eyeshadow .we 're going to use some black cream liner .some black mascara and we will use some under eye brightener with concealer .and for our lip look , we 're actually going to mix two shades of lipstick , we 're going to mix a really pale , nude tone with a little bit of a peachy tone to give us a really nice peachy bronzy kind of look .so those are some of the supplies that you 'll want to use to create a really great sun-kissed beach babe look .
alright , another shot you can use in your repertoire. [CLS] [SEP]is a backhand shot .goalies usually do n't expect this .usually , typically , you 're going to use it closer to the net .you can flick it up high on the net while the goalie 's down .or , you can even pass with it .but , the way to do that is almost like the reverse of your wrist shot .you 're going to get your feet planted , knees back , and you 're just. [CLS] [SEP], basically you 're transferring your weight , just like you did with the wrist shot .you 're going to pull it back .now the backhand , you cup the back of the stick , you 've got your hands nice and firm on your stick , and then you 're just going to transfer and follow through , and all your weight should transfer on to the front foot while your legs are bent .and you always point to where you 're shooting .and that way it will , you know it 's going to hit your target .and that 's basically a backhand shot .
now that you have been able to gain an advantage to the outside of the body , she throws her punch , i block , move to the outside , now i 've to look at targets .now , as far as throwing punches , very first target is straight on to the arm and when you strike you want to strike roughly an inch above the elbow because that is the place where the arm will most likely break .also , you can strike into the tricep or you can strike underneath the arm. [CLS] [SEP], also strike into the underside. [CLS] [SEP]so it sort of numbs out the arm a little bit .other targets obviously are into the kidneys , to the side of the head , specifically the temple area as you strike .you can also take and throw a back fist towards the front of the face , if you want to go ahead and try to get the nose or anything like that you could throw a back fist into it .also , when you throw your punches , you also want to make sure that you 're not going to throw into areas that could possibly injure your hand .be careful if you throw it. [CLS] [SEP]and you accidentally hit the side of the head here .try to aim for a little bit softer tissues , around into the ear or the side of the temple .again , when you are throwing this strike here onto the arm , you not only can use a punch , but you can also use your arm to strike with so that it has a little bit more blunt force to it .so that is just a few targets and a few striking areas that you can use for your punches .
okay , we 've spent the last three segments talking about ways in which you can move cards in accordion .and , there 's actually four ways .so , here 's the fourth .its three stacks over by suit .so how does that work ?well , here 's a diamond ,that is 1-2-3 stacks from another diamond .so we can play that there .we can play this seven of diamonds on top of this ten .i can then play diamonds on diamonds , here , but we 're not talking about that type of move .where else , let 's see .well , if we look over at these hearts , i can more this ten , 1-2-3 , on top of that queen of hearts .and then this eight of hearts , 1-2-3 , on top of the ten of hearts .where else can i move cards three over by suit ?here 's a five of clubs and it is 1-2-3 from the king of clubs .and , here 's the ace of diamonds , 1-2-3 from the jack of diamonds .you see how we quickly go from 52 cards or stacks down to a couple dozen .it 's not hard to play this game , although it does take up a bit of space .
alright i am basically going to mirror the major exercises here in the minor key just so you can hear what it sounds like. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to go through all the fingering. [CLS] [SEP]so you can get the hang of that and the first one i am going to do is the seconds exercise that i did at the beginning with the major scales so looking at my keys. [CLS] [SEP]we just go. [CLS] [SEP]let 's see i 'm going to start on c , go to e flat , d , f , e flat , g , f , a , g , b flat , a , c , b flat , d , c.so that just got you through the whole cycle of seconds going through that. [CLS] [SEP]and i will just play it for you real fast .one , two , ready , go .and there you have it .that 's a minor exercise in c. [CLS] [SEP]practice that a couple times .
and i am a software developer .in this video i 'll show you how to add a link to a picture .i am using frontpage .frontpage is a registered trademark of microsoft , a company to which i have no affiliation .if you want to add an image gallery on your web site , you should create small preview images called thumbnails .these images are usually between seventy-five to two hundred pixels in width and height .they serve as links to the pictures in their entire resolution .a good practice is to create images folder in the same directory where you store the web page .inside the images folder i have the thumbnails and the original pictures .to insert a thumbnail as a link , select insert , picture and thumb file .browse through the images folder and select the thumbnail .click on the picture .press again on the insert tab. [CLS] [SEP]and this time choose hyper link .browse again to the images folder and now select the original image .save the file and open it in your web browser .click on the picture and you will see the original image .i am luis estrada. [CLS] [SEP]and i 've just showed you how to create a multimedia web site using frontpage .
the dragon stretch is , can be , can be as challenging as you want it to be .but , the more effort you put into the various stretches , the more benefit you 'll feel when you are doing your martial arts training .
hi .i 'm travis corpering and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to try to teach you just how to get recruited into a basketball program .what you want to do first of all is , you want to try your best .number one thing is to get your grades up .that 's the number one thing .get your grades up enough to where you can actually play basketball .if you make the team , what you want to do is , you want to , well , first of all , try our for your high school team .once you try out for your high school team , if you get your skills up enough to where you can make it , and that 's a lot of hard work .that 's putting in practice over the summer .that 's working out every day after you do your homework .that 's putting a lot of work into it .but once you get to the point where you actually make the team , you make your high school team and you want to excel at the high school level .yes .first of all , start .if you can get to where you can actually start , then by your senior year of high school , you 're in a position to where you can kind of command a little more time on the floor .then , three things you want to do .you want to excel in at least one area .do really well in at least one area , whether it be shooting , scoring or rebounding .maybe you 're a big man and your thing is just you 're a big body under the rim and. [CLS] [SEP]when they pass it down low , you can dunk .whatever you do , do it really well and make sure scouts see that when you know scouts are coming to the game .the larger games , when you 're playing against large area rivals or games where there 's going to be a large number of people or a huge crowd or at a huge venue , you want to really do your best just to show whoever is there that you 're worth their time and effort .so , whatever you do , do it well .possibly , if you possibly can , try to average double digits .do n't let anyone see that you 're a selfish player .do n't be a selfish player .make sure you get your assists up .you want to be a good rebounder and play excellent defense .you do those things and you got a good shot of getting into a college program .after that , then you can try to get yourself set up to where you can get some nba scouts looking at you , possibly go to the pros .there you have it .getting into a basketball program .
so from wide leg forward bend , come up , and prepare for warrior 2.and lift the spine horizontal , hold the horizontal , as long as you want , as long as you can , at least a couple of moments , and then press down with the feet , come all the way up .this transition , keep your hands on your hips , and when you get to the top , really pull up , pull up on the fronts of the hips , not by squeezing the backsides , but just toning , right here in the abdomen , between the hip bones and ribs .so for warrior 2 , first things first ; have each heel in line with each sitting bone , in other words , do n't have one forward and one back .then whichever leg you 're going to turn , ( in this case i 'm turning the right leg )turn on the heel please , and leave it there .so if my heel is still in line with my sitting bone , my other heel is still in line with my sitting bone ; you do it any other way , the alignment is going to be thrown off , okay .so we started from this upright position , and we were neutral. [CLS] [SEP], the spine was neutral , it was erect when i first stand up , now i turn , now watch what happens , right , that 's the turning of the leg .well we want to resist that .the spirit warrior 2 is the spine is really , really up right .and so this is the prime opportunity to work the muscles around the root , and find that root support .so i 'm going to squeeze the sitting bones together , and i 'm going to palpate the front of the hips , and we 're going to look for them to be level and as straight ahead as they can be , reasonably speaking .
now i 'm going to teach you the difficult part movement for the burmese rama solo .when you drag back i will slow you very show you very slowly .one , two , three , go .one , two , three , go .one , two , three , go .now to continue with the hands slow movement .when you say , one , two , three , go , one , two , three , go .one , two , three , go and up .now to have the first one when you see .it 's moving very fast. [CLS] [SEP]so you have to see carefully .i hope you understand and to show you one more time .slow to movement .one , two , three , go .one , two , three , go .one , two , three .
okay , now once you have that all put together and all your seams checked we are ready to cut our batting out .you go ahead and lay your batting down first , and then lay your blanket on top .and you want to cut around it and allow some room for extra .batting 's not highly expensive so it does n't hurt to have extra .and for my family quilt , i 'm actually using one of our old blankets that we had bought years ago that i really liked the weight of it. [CLS] [SEP]but it was just frayed all to heck .so , i 'm going to use that for the inside of mine 'cause you wo n't see where it 's frayed. [CLS] [SEP]and i can have that nice weight and a new blanket .you want to be careful not to try to push the scissors 'cause if you rip it then it 'll stretch the edges out funny .so , you want to keep your scissors chopping .looks like we 're done ; it should look something like that .
now i am going to show you the veil work with the headlock and arms in egyptian style .you are always going to get started with your veil on the bottom or to the side , but this time we are going to start with the veil on the bottom .also , if you work with a veil like this that does the half circle i always recommend you to use this beautiful pattern because when you start your veil work on the floor like this , it looks like it is a part of your outfit .you can have this position and you can perform your headlock .and this half is the egyptian style and the egyptians worked a lot with their eyes. [CLS] [SEP], you look like this and it is very playful movement too .you can be serious , but i like to be playful .from here you can go all the way to the top and keep working with your head slide or headlock .basically , you are going to be sliding your head .i am going to do it without the veil so you can see .you are going to place your arms in this position and you are going to slide the head , lock , slide the head , lock , and slide the head , lock .and you can compliment with the eyes like i said .and a beautiful smile is always welcome .once again , you are going to grab your veil as far as possible like i told you before .so you are going to have the space .i told you i think in the first segment , first clip .and then you are going to place your hands together on the top .and you are going to slide your head , look like that , look .and no you have the veil work with headlock egyptian style .
i think it is important in which brand. [CLS] [SEP]you use. [CLS] [SEP]but you could look into it. [CLS] [SEP]and you could buy any type of whole house water filter that you think is appropriate .the one we use stimulates natural spring water as layers of settlements that the water filters through , it alcoholized the water .we want it to be alkaline not acid , acidity causes lots of health problems from heartburn to cancer and it also buts negative ions into the water .so when you shower you shower it is like showering in a mountain stream or a water fall .then i wanted to point out. [CLS] [SEP]we keep our bicycle in here. [CLS] [SEP]so not only i do exercise indoors in the morning but everyday. [CLS] [SEP]at some point i make it a point to get out on my bicycle. [CLS] [SEP]or we live right at the beach .i make it a point to get over to the beach and take a swim in the ocean or a walk on the beach very important to do outside exercise in fresh healthy air .
in this we 're going to talk a little bit about some of the angles that you 're going to be cutting with your , with your circular saw .again , when we 're making adjustments we 're unplugged .we just did. [CLS] [SEP]a forty-five degree cut did n't we so now. [CLS] [SEP]if you look ; can you get a nice shot of the gauge ?notice that the angle gauge is marked at forty-five , thirty , twenty-two and a half , fifteen .thirty degrees is a very common angle , but the most common is forty-five and twenty-two and a half .when you make , let 's make a forty-five degree cut. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'll show you how they come together .now that we 've set our angle we can plug the saw back in , clamp up our piece of wood , and we 'll make our cut .and here you 'll see that two forty-fives make a nice ninety-degree corner .that 's the forty-five degree cut .
hi , this is jon and in this clip we will be installing our door sweep .if we take a look at the very bottom of our door , we have a fairly significant gap where wind and air , or even bugs could get in .to remedy this , our door has come with a sweep and a rubber gasket for that sweep so that we can form a nice , tight seal on the bottom ; so no air or bugs or anything can get in .the first thing we need to do is feed our rubber gasket into the channel on our door sweep and we 're just going to fit it all the way down .then we 're just going to trim off the extra .after that , we 're just going to take our door sweep and our door. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're just going to snap that in place at the bottom .now our door sweep does adjust up and down depending on how much gap you need to fill .so what you need to do is close your door and set your gap correctly and then put in your screws .and of course when you 're done , you will want to double check the fit of your door sweep .
what makes a `` q '' a `` q '' , the tail .the `` r '' starts out with a minim stroke now just like with the `` b '' and the `` d '' going to start up here .think tall and thin come down like that , see how i made this a little thinner through here .it looks more elegant , not as clunky .now the `` s '' as long spine on the `` s '' like so , think about this as being a narrow letter. [CLS] [SEP]but this is different .this stroke right here goes like this ,so that 's different than the roman .the roman would go like this. [CLS] [SEP]but this goes like this and this comes around lot like the `` c '' .the `` t '' can have a little hairline that comes above the line if it wants to , just to get out of the way of the next letter here. [CLS] [SEP]'s our minim stroke .relaxed , very relaxed. [CLS] [SEP], see we 're starting to get into , the `` u '' was n't really there. [CLS] [SEP]yet. [CLS] [SEP]so we 're just pretending that it was there. [CLS] [SEP]but it was beginning .there was the `` w '' we 're just intuiting a `` w '' .very relaxed now watch this , see how i did that ?you do n't have to go back over this stroke. [CLS] [SEP]or you do n't want to have to , relax .little bit below the line , `` z '' , think tall , think slender and relaxed .there you go .
one of the best ways to learn how to do any trick on a quarter pipe or a mini-ramp , is first to find a spot that does n't have any coping on it .the coping sometimes can be the hardest thing to get away from , or to get over when you 're coming out of certain tricks .and especially for the fakie ollie disaster , this is especially true .because as you 're coming back in , sometimes your feet wo n't be ready and you 'll hit the coping , or where the coping would be here , and lock up and fall in .so , it 'll be good if you can find a quarter pipe like this concrete one that i 'm on right now , where you can come up and hit it and actually get to leave it just a tiny bit and get the motion down , and then be able to roll in , no problem and not have any coping to worry about .what 's different on this spot is that i wo n't have to put my front foot on the front nose and specifically pick up to clear coping .what you 'll be able to do , is come up fakie , pop the trick , land , and in any foot position that you 're in , you 'll be able to roll back in , since there 's no coping .so , if you can find a spot to learn your tricks on like this one , it 'll definitely help in the learning process .and this is just one way that it 'll help to learn to do fakie ollie disasters .
remember your jump rope is optional .now that we 've finished doing those push ups , we 're feeling nice and strong , it 's time to get that imaginary jump rope out or your real one .this time we 're going to focus on jumping forward and back .this works totally different muscles , you 'll feel it .to demonstrate , i 'll show you how forward and back with the jump rope would go .your feet would go something like this .you want to stay on your toes , and you want to use your imaginary jump rope as you 're doing it .especially if you do n't have good coordination , just use your imaginary jump rope .you can do all kinds of things with it .you can even double jump doing it .but keep going and breathe .you want to just keep going for three minutes , and at the end of that , we 're back to doing more strength .
so now that you 've got your clay centered , you 're ready to start the form .you want to take your left index finger and push down .then take your right hand , just it 's there to stabilize and squeeze the sponge if you need water .and then you 're going to pull your left index finger towards your right hand .compress the floor .but before you call that done , you want to take your needle tool clean it off .put it right through the center and it 'll leave a smudge that 'll tell you how deep that floor is .you want it to be about a quarter of an inch .and once you 've got that , the depth that you want it to be , you can take your hard rib , i like to use a hard , metal rib , and compress the floor .that makes it smooth .it also makes it stronger by the compression .and now we 've got this pieced opened , and we 're ready to start pulling the walls .
spain happens to be one of the cheapest countries to visit in europe , but you still want to save a little money by making your long distance calls on weekends and nights .determine what time it is in the united states .spain is one hour ahead of greenwich. [CLS] [SEP]mean time , which means that it is six hours later in spain than it is on the east coast of the us and it is nine hours later , than it is on the west coast .the first thing you have to do , is to punch in the international access code for spain , which is 00.then secondly you have to dial 1 , which is the country code for the united states .the third step is really easy again , because you only have to dial the city code for the city you which to call in the united states .the last step is to dial the remaining seven digits .
okay , so now we have our curling ribbon through our flower and we 're going to place that towards the bottom of the party boa or the boa .it 's not the party boa yet .it 's getting there .i 'm going to place it at the bottom , approximately -- say an inch or so .and this time , when i pull the ribbon around , i 'm going to tie the ribbon right in the front of the flower and through the --i think they call that the stamen or something , that 's the center of the flower --and that 's where we 're going to be knotting it .now remember , our first ribbon was towards the back and this one 's going to be towards the front .and i 'm actually going to just do a knot .and if you noticed , it goes right around the whole center of the flower there .and we just make a knot .and now , it depends on how long you want to have your ribbon .i think i 'm going to make this ribbon a little bit shorter and just coordinate the difference. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm going to trim it a little bit .and now it 's time to curl it .for curling ribbon , it 's --so you take. [CLS] [SEP]-- open up your scissors and one side of your scissors , you place up against the ribbon and you pull outward like that. [CLS] [SEP]and it curls it up .so we 're going to do it on both sides .you noticed i am curling from the center out this way so that it -- both of the curls , they curl towards the center of the flower .that 's kinda neat .and so there we have the bottom flower of our party boa .now , we 're ready to do the other side .
i like to use slighter lighter than the foundation around your eyes .remember we want lightness around your eyes .with women of color , because of melanin , sometimes causes darker circles around the eye .so , it 's important to use concealer .you could use concealer with your hands , you could use concealers with a sponge , or with your foundation brush .remember if you are using it with your hands you want to use your weakest finger , which is your ring finger .i personally like to use a brush .so , i 'm gon na go ahead and put on a lighter concealer than the foundation around shevon 's eyes .i start from the outside corner and i work my way in .remember you do n't want to pull. [CLS] [SEP], you just want to press and touch .so , once we 've got the basics , i 'll use my ring finger and go in and pat it in getting as close to the rim to the eye as you can .you could see the difference , physically see the difference what the concealer makes .from her eye without any concealer to her eye with concealer ; it makes it look fresh and bright .with the left over concealer , i like to use it on the lids .just place a little color .it makes your eyes nice and bright. [CLS] [SEP]and then it also helps the shadow last longer .
now , i will teach you some signs for hair type and color .hair .hair .curly .curly .straight .straight .long .long .short .for colors , you might have blonde .similar to the sign for yellow .brown .black .let 's review .curly .straight .short .medium lengths .long .brown .black .blonde .cut .you might cut your hair or go to a hair stylist .good job .
this is mark bowers , from bowersphotography.com .i 'm in american fork , utah , and this segment. [CLS] [SEP], we 're talking about mood lighting .now , we 're just going to show you a little bit about what a light does as it travels around your face .i 've just got a little reflector with a little bit of softening on it , and as we move it around the face , we want to see a little bit what it does for back lighting , and move the light around , a little bit more to side lighting , move it. [CLS] [SEP]around.this is actually called loop lighting , and glamor light is straight on , and we can also do the other side , but the really moody things , lights , come from underneath ,where there 's a highlight under your chin , a highlight under your nose , a highlight under your eye .it 's not natural in nature , and that 's why it stands out as really a moody style of light , and so it 's the direction of the light , that really creates the mood , and now , i 'd like to show you an example of what we did with some mood lighting , continued .it 's a nice guy that really wanted to get into ultimate fighting , and had to have some professional portraits done , of what he could do .we placed lights behind him , and to the side slightly , and created a lot of the contrast , between the highlights , and the shadows , to really show off the mood , of this type of photograph .
so here 's some common mistakes that you might make while you 're working a ribbing .i 've started a knit 2 , purl 2 rib .so one way , is if you 're knitting , and you do n't bring your yarn in front , but you do your purl , so you 'd go to do your purl , and you 'd wrap your yarn , and your yarn would come around the needle , and you 'd have an extra loop on it .another thing would be , is if you were knitting your ribbing , and you forgot , and then you have knit 3 , but then you threw yourself off , and you have knit 2 , and you threw your whole ribbing off , this is where you would need to unknit back to where you made your era .so you 'd turn your work around , and you would unknit those stitches to get back to. [CLS] [SEP]when you had it going the right way .so now i 'm back , i can see that i 've got my knit 3 , ( knit 2 rather ) and go back to my knit 2 , purl 2.basically you just want to keep your focus that you 're doing a knit 2 , purl 2 .
now we 're going to hit the other side of the forearm , the bottom part , right here .generally , with this , you 're just going to do different forms of wrist curls .i 'm just going to start with a barbell wrist curl .i 'm just going to grab a barbell , preferably , wrist hanging off the end of the bench here ,elbows on the bench , as well .going to curl right down to your fingertips and then curl right back up and then twist the wrist in and get that nice contraction .i 'll show you a few reps right here .down to the fingertips , squeeze right in .do n't forget to curl those wrists in at the end of the movement .you do n't want to just come up and stop here , you want to squeeze right in .you could even switch it up , if you want by using a dumbbell .i 'll show you real quick .grab a dumbbell , one of them will do because you can only do one at a time .again , same idea , wrists are hanging off the bench , elbow on the bench , curling right down to the fingertips , coming right back up , squeezing the wrist in , contracting the forearm .i like to use dumbbell just because you can really focus on each forearm and just really get that mass in there. [CLS] [SEP]but barbells are good to switch it up , as well .if you need to do that .
we 've got our , our sleeve now that we want to take in .this is too big , i 'm not into that at all .so , i want to take it in probably to about here , i 'm going to slide a pin in , as best i can with my one hand .so , my sleeve is going to be like that .that might still be a little big , i 'm going to add , i 'm going to take it in more .there we go .and , i 'm also going to raise. [CLS] [SEP], i do n't like the way this is coming , this is not , not flattering to me .this would be much more flattering if i 'd raise the shoulder seam to here .so , what i want to do is make a mark there as to where i want to bring it up .i want it to be brought up like that , and now this is feeling a little tight. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm just going to alter. [CLS] [SEP]this is little bit , just drop it down a hair .feels a lot better .and , then i 'll put a pin over it right here .it 's easier when you have somebody pinning it , or when you have you know , four hands , but you can make do with yourself .you can , pin that up. [CLS] [SEP]and then i just want to put one down here. [CLS] [SEP]where i know it 's going to be about. [CLS] [SEP], i think that 's a good. [CLS] [SEP], that 's good for me , so i 'm just going to throw a pin in the wrist , so i know to continue this line down to there .i 'll just blend it. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'll show you how that 's done .and , there we go , now we have a map for our shirt .
now it 's time to talk about what happens after the draw .after the draw comes another betting round .the player to the dealer 's left can check or bet .he says check .the action goes around to you .you , remember , had that pat seven low , at this time you 're going to bet .the reason is you want to get paid before your seven low .now before the draw you bet two black chips .so you want to make sure you bet a little more .you 're going to say four black chips .player to your left can fold , call or raise .he calls .i 'm going to call and put out four black chips .this player calls and puts out four black chips .what happens now ?what does everybody have ?well we 're saving that for the next segment .but i can tell you with your seven low pat hand you 're in good shape .
one of the newer plants that really has taken off is the lepto we call it and the lepto has these beautiful little pink blossoms that tend to be covered about ten months of the year .leptospermum. [CLS] [SEP]i think is the latin name for it. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's one that we see growing in full sun to partial shade .now this plant is nice and full and it has blooms on all the terminal growth .a good bloomer type fertilizer , probably about every two months in a high light area , maybe about every three or four months in a low light area and remember of course that some of the bloomer type fertilizers will be a little higher in the second and third number .when you plant this make sure that 's. [CLS] [SEP]it 's in a good peaty type soil , they really like a good organic base soil. [CLS] [SEP]and they 'll do better for you. [CLS] [SEP]when you , when you plant it .make sure it 's planted at the same depth level that was growing in this particular container or the container you buy .you can get bigger containers and smaller ones of this plant .remember that the smaller the container the more frequently you have to water .the lepto 's are plants. [CLS] [SEP]that flower ten months of the year. [CLS] [SEP]and it will make a nice addition in your landscape .for on gardening i 'm stan defreitas `` mr. [CLS] [SEP]green thumb '' .
alright lets start on the eyeballs now , get them to close there eyes and what your going to do. [CLS] [SEP]is make a nice circular eyeball and just fill it in with black .so this is their pupil .just make sure they keep their eye 's closed because if they open it it will smear everywhere. [CLS] [SEP]and it wo n't pretty or very good .you can always fix if they do .now you kind of want to make the eyeballs straight because if you do n't they 're going to look a little cross eyed and that 's just weird .so just try to get it somewhat symmetrical to start off with .
but , proportion is very important .i generally teach my students that you should not have a large piece of paper with a little bitty still life right in the middle of it .everything should fit the paper .you may have the object go off of the page at one place or another , but they all should be in proportion in relation to each other .that means the number of portions , the size of the portions , and remember , you do not want everything the same size .and , when you get to number of things on the page , remember , it 's three , six , nine , or twelve .stay tuned for the next segment which is on rhythm .
obviously a paddle is extremely important while kayaking. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're gon na need it to get down the river .but , choosing one you can rely on in tricky situations is important .now while this particular paddle is well used and well loved i trust it to be strong and durable when i need it to be .for these you want a good quality shaft so that if you 're wading with them or you need it in a pin situation to support yourself , it 's going to last .now , something else that you should consider when you 're using a paddle is it 's visibility .for river signals the black carbon paddles can reflect light pretty well , however , if you 've got something that does n't or is n't that colorful. [CLS] [SEP]then you want to consider adding some color to it , either with stickers or reflective tape or paint so that you can be seen giving those signals with your paddle .again , when you 're buying a paddle you want to consider that durability so going with the cheapest option may be appealing however , making sure that you 've got a paddle that you know is n't going to break is also important .a good aid to the paddle , if you 're going to be using this , is also a break down paddle .paddles do break and in the back of your boat. [CLS] [SEP]you can store break down paddles .they often piece down into four bits and you can even get them in the smallest of kayaks .these also are very durable .
now we are going to add some extra hip movements to our egyptian walk .so let 's just start with our basic egyptian walk .weights on the right foot .left foots up on show girl foot .make sure the angles not falling out .good !make sure the knees bend .belly buttons pulled in .chest lifted .shoulder 's back and down .good !this hips going to come straight up into our rib cage .and as we drop it , we are going to accent the drop .drop !and then as we step over to the other side , we are going to accent that step with the hip lift on this side .so now this hip is free .lift , drop , switch .lift , drop , and switch .lift and then drop .so as you 're going your adding extra hip movements .good !but you do n't want to lose your initial up and down movement .so think of everything as an up and then down and the switch .good !also make sure that your level is not changing .it ’ s very easy to go up on the up .and down on the down and then switch .but we do n't want this type of movement .right !so you want nice level .practice in the mirror .then we 'll have that up down and then switch , without doing a level change .
but you do it every time .every quarterback is going to throw it .this is the wrist snap drill .what we do is we have our hand up and all we do is emphasize turn , turn .this is the top motion of every throw .do n't have your hand here , have it high and go to the top half of your motion .you do this for about 5 minutes .you will be fatigued but just imagine i 'm throwing a ball 60 times a game .make sure you have that wrist snap .want that wrist snap , throwing motion .
here we have an example , two examples of two different types that intersect .there are many creatures in the game which are both artifacts and creatures .this represents the idea of robots and other war machines and siege engines .this is the extruder , and this is a goblin war wagon .they both say artifact creature on their type , and they both have power and toughness in the lower right hand corner .that means that these cards can be affected either by things that affect artifacts , destroy target artifact or enchantment such as disenchant .or something that says target creature gets minus three minus three until end of turn .either icker slick or disenchant could kill either of these cards because they 're both artifacts for disenchant , and they both have three toughness for icker slick .these cards have advantages in that they 're colorless and can be played in any deck for the cost of four manna each in any color .but they also have disadvantages of being susceptible to a wider range of cards .
our warm up is going to be focusing on your ankles .the first one that we 're going to do is what 's called the ankles-circles .so you 're going to bring your feet close together. [CLS] [SEP], so you feel like you have a nice stable base underneath you .you 're going to extend your right leg out in front of you. [CLS] [SEP], you 're going to point your toe to the floor .now you 're going to lift your toe , thinking of your big toe , you 're going to circle up around and down and continue .so this is also working , this one , the ankle that we 're working here , but this is also working a dual purpose instability .okay , on this foot that you 're standing on , this is working your fast twitch muscles , which are making your tendons and inside the ligaments in your ankle much stronger .now , repeat to the opposite direction .okay .then we 'll place that foot down and we 'll do the same thing on the opposite side .your leg will go straight out , point the toe and now circle in , down and round .you 'll feel if in the ankle that you 're warming up here. [CLS] [SEP]and you 'll also feel that working on your base ankle .and not reverse the opposite direction , and place your foot down .and this is how we warm up our ankles , kung fu for health .
we 're going to start with one ball .what you do , is you 're actually going to do a scooping motion , and you always catch the ball on the outside , you scoop down and throw on the inside , and you 're going to catch it on the outside , scoop in .so you scoop down. [CLS] [SEP], you throw it , you catch on the outside , scoop it , throw it , catch on the outside , and you 've got to make sure you keep that scooping motion .if you just throw up and down , balls are going to end up hitting each other as they try and cross over .also , if you get this down now , when you try to add three in and you 're making sure you 're going back and forth , and not out , when you add three in , that helps keep you from running after the balls which is a common , common occurrence when you 're trying to learn to juggle .once again , make sure you have a ball that 's heavy enough , but not too heavy so that it 's comfortable when you hold it , about half to three quarters of a pound per ball .
we 're going to do a bit of a paddle and roll combination .and this one 's a little different .it adds some kind of like triple heel slaps and then into like a nice little syncopated finish .so let 's start part one of the paddle combination .watch my feet .ok let 's start the paddle combination on the left foot. [CLS] [SEP]you 're going to do a heel drop and then stop , heel dig with your right foot .then you 're doing it on the other leg .so that is .and then you 're going to go into a riff and the last part .so let 's try the first part of the paddle again .ready ?and .and now we 're going to go in to part two of the paddle combination .
 , that 's how we count it .you 've got the kick drum coming in on the e of two .okay , so you have 2 , snare and high hat , e , two-e-and-a , and then you have your upbeat on a high hat. [CLS] [SEP]'cause you 've just got those straight eighths , one-and-two-and. [CLS] [SEP], alright ?so , two-e-and , and then you 're going to have the snare on the last sixteenth note ,a , okay ?so , you just kind of all over , just all beat two , two-e-and-a. [CLS] [SEP], okay ?so , just the hands , what 's happening ?you have both hitting on downbeat. [CLS] [SEP]and then you have your upbeat in your right and that last sixteenth note your left .and then , throw in the kick drum , so then , beats one and two put them together ,okay ?three-e-and-a-four-e-and-a. [CLS] [SEP], okay , so this is a lot independents going on , sixteenth notes kinda sneaking in between .take some time to work it out .we 'll go on the beat three .
how to define upper arms .well for me it goes from the elbow up to the delt and so while biceps and triceps are all part of that. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to assume for this video that you are doing that somehow .the biggest and most important thing to get that kind of a cap if you are looking for the cap with that little line that everybody likes that gives you that strong definition look , it is going to come from delts .this cap here is from your shoulder delts .i have three ways i like to do it .i like to do my sides , i like to do my fronts. [CLS] [SEP]and then my rear delts .what it does is it gives you that look. [CLS] [SEP]so when you are walking by somebody it just has that upper arm definition .so the three exercises that are the most important are your side lateral raises and the way that is usually demonstrated or is at least expressed is like pouring out water .this is what a lot of people do .that does n't do anything for you .well it might build your traps. [CLS] [SEP]but that is not going to give you upper arms .you are going to have to keep them where you pull them outside. [CLS] [SEP]and i am going to encourage you to go a little lighter than you think because then they 're quite a lot of weight .these are only 15 's and so this would be actually not a bad weight for me as long as i 've been doing this. [CLS] [SEP]that 's pretty good. [CLS] [SEP]so if you are just starting out do n't be afraid of those 10 's .if you have got form it is going to look way better .so there is your sides , your front that are simply just straight on up working that front , i like to call what i say go to my eyes. [CLS] [SEP]so as soon as i see my hands in front of my eyes they start .then of course the rear delt looks like the side lateral raise. [CLS] [SEP]but it is back more , more open , not like this but back and open .so what i do is i go. [CLS] [SEP], i 'll go one , one , and one is one. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'll do like four sets of 15 of that. [CLS] [SEP]and you wo n't believe the pump you get right here. [CLS] [SEP]and then after a while you will start seeing that cap .good luck .
or i break that window that alarm is going to start wailing .that ’ s a really good deterrent and like. [CLS] [SEP]i ’ ve spoken before in the past , the deterrent is the biggest security you can have because if you make your vehicle or your home a little tougher to get into , the thief ’ s going to walk on , he ’ s going to go to the next vehicle .as you can see here , the red light on the dash is flashing and that ’ s a really good deterrent because a thief walks up , he sees that light flashing , he knows that if he opens the door , that alarms going to start wailing and somebody ’ s going to come , you know at least pay some attention , maybe even come out running with a you know , big hammer in their hand .another really good deterrent is the stickers that say you have an alarm system .this is something you really want , even if you don ’ t have an alarm you can put these stickers on and a thief ’ s not really going to know the difference .i ’ ve seen these stickers at wal-mart , i ’ ve seen them at different automotive places and they ’ re just a small sticker ,like this one says automotive theft protection .that means that there ’ s some type of an alarm system in here. [CLS] [SEP]and if a thief sees these and actually takes the time to pay attention to .he ’ s going to think twice about getting into your vehicle .basically when the thief walks up to your car and he sees the red flashing light on the dash and he sees the sticker , he knows that when he comes up to this car and he opens it , honk ! , that ’ s what ’ s going to happen .one of the big things you can do to avoid calling me , is your little remote system , it has a battery in the back and if it stops working you can , couple of things you can do .you can pop the battery back off , a lot of them just pop off with a screwdriver , some of them actually have a screw in it , but it ’ s a battery that ’ s commonly available at most of your auto parts , most of your electronic stores , heck , even a lot of grocery stores carry the batteries now .they ’ re a couple of bucks , first thing you want to try if your alarms not working or. [CLS] [SEP]it ’ s not working properly is check that battery , replace it , see what happens , maybe it will cure your problems and save you a service call from me .
and i would show you what supplies are needed .
corners usually get missed .grab this top edge and clean it .but you do n't want to take your rag no matter how clean your rag is , how dry it is , i do n't like to ever take my towel and rub out a spot with my towel , just because if you 're in the bright sunlight and the sun is shining on that window everywhere that you put your towel. [CLS] [SEP]it 's going show up as a little spot on the window .there 's a techique we can use that will take off the spots without using a cotton towel because it 's not the best thing to use if you can avoid it .
now the carrick bend with ends adjacent is actually an old knot , it is actually a family knot belonging to harfod the wake and his family .knots we will find out usually have family ranks that denote royalty , hierarchy and what not , especially when we get into the saxon and keltic races or religions , however you want to look at them .they are very special knots to these people , they spend a lot time actually coming up with `` family knots '' as you can tell with keltic knots , keltic designs and what not like that .what we are going to look at right now is these two ropes i have got coming in here together , i am going to actually remove one of these for the moment .i am just going to go ahead and take this , i am going to put a bend in it , like so , now i am going to take my other rope. [CLS] [SEP]and it is actually going to go underneath this one from the opposite end. [CLS] [SEP], it is going to come over this one , over my working end , under my standing end , back through and over my working end here , for my blue rope , under the standing end of my red rope and over once again .i did this wrong. [CLS] [SEP], what we will do is we will take , this is how it should be , we are going to take this one back over .what we are going to do is create a pretzel shape more or less .this is how this knot should look , when you get it tied .start pulling it together , this knot is a knot that should lay flat because it is a `` show knot '' .this know was actually in herrod 's family tree , it was actually printed on their armor .
i 'm just going to show you the timing of that. [CLS] [SEP]cause you want to get that right .now , as you can see we have green tomatoes , find a pick , some people love fried green tomatoes. [CLS] [SEP]they 're really tasty .these orange tomatoes are not quiet ready yet .think about how they would look in a supermarket and that 'll give you a good idea when to pick a tomato .now , i 'm looking at this plant and i see one that will be great to have with dinner tonight and that 's going to be this one here .now , going back to this one for a second , if i try to pull that off it 's not ready to come off .it 's very stiff , it 's very attached in the plant , that 's another way to tell it 's not ready. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's also very hard. [CLS] [SEP]you want it to be kind of soft .but again , going back to the color , just about when it 's about that color is when you want to do it and kind of grab the branch. [CLS] [SEP]you 're pulling it from and twist and pull at the same time. [CLS] [SEP]it should come off very , very easily with just like that .boy is it going to be good !now we 're going to harvest some beans .i grow pole beans because my garden is small and what i like to do is kind of climb up and start looking through the branches .now it 's not the length of the bean that matters. [CLS] [SEP]it 's the diameter of the bean .what i like to do is pick the bean that has n't gone to seed , is n't going to be too bumpy. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to be about the diameter of a pencil .so we 're going to look through here and see what we can find .let 's see here. [CLS] [SEP]'s a couple right here. [CLS] [SEP], you want to expose them. [CLS] [SEP]and they usually grow in clumps .you 'll usually see 1 , 2 , 3 , maybe more. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to pick one off , again hold the branch that you 're pulling it from and just kind of pinch it off. [CLS] [SEP]and you can see it 's not a very fat bean. [CLS] [SEP], it does n't have a lot of bumps in it and the seeds have n't formed yet and up here again. [CLS] [SEP]there 's going to be a few more that we can pick and look around .on the opposite end of the spectrum you can see these beans here. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to pick one off. [CLS] [SEP]so you can see it better .it 's a little early. [CLS] [SEP]it 's okay to have these. [CLS] [SEP]but i do n't think they 've really developed their full flavor yet. [CLS] [SEP]but you know what they 're still pretty good .now i just want to see if i can find one on here. [CLS] [SEP]that 's gone by. [CLS] [SEP], it might not be as tasty and here we go , here 's a couple right here .i 'll pull both of those off .now as you can see , see those bumps in there ?that 's where the seed has started to form , they 're okay. [CLS] [SEP]but they 're not going to be really good .so again i think the ideal time when you pick a bean is when it 's just like that .
and it 's not going to take a whole lot of weight because you 're going to have to control a lot of momentum .so coming in at walker ped position on all fours .hands underneath the shoulders .knees hip width apart. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to extend and then curl and then extend with a slight bend in the knee .so your goal is not to lock out the knee .but you want to stay lifted and preferably you want to stay square looking towards the ground and release .and you 're really going to feel all that peak contraction actually when you 're extended .so this is a constant contraction with the cable pulley system .hence one of the reasons why it 's my most favorite and effective pieces of equipment because it emulates strengthening in an elongated state. [CLS] [SEP]so you 're hitting a both a peak contraction and elongation .10 to 15 reps. [CLS] [SEP]1 to 3 sets .each side .
okay , blended teas .what is a blended tea ?well it 's just like it sounds .its two kinds of tea blended together .now , you won ?t really see a blend of tea very often that is like a green tea blended with a black tea .or a white tea blended with an oolong .you might see that from time to time but generally we 're talking about blending teas of the same basic category like black teas or green teas with one another .okay ,so as i said before .you have teas that are grown in different parts of the world and they have different characteristics .one tea might have a lot of caffeine and the other tea might have a really smooth flavor .so maybe you 'll mix a darjeeling black tea with an assam black tea to create a black tea blend .and some famous blends that you may have heard of are like english breakfast tea , is a blend of several kinds of black teas .and irish breakfast tea as well as indian breakfast are all different blends of black teas .and so with all these different teas i encourage you to go out and buy them and try them so that you can find out what blends or what plain old single type teas. [CLS] [SEP]you like the best .
it is a regular back pack .when you have twins you find that you do n't have the shoulder space for a over the single shoulder diaper bag .so it works good just to have it on your back .anyways one good thing that you need the most. [CLS] [SEP]are. [CLS] [SEP]i guess all these things you need the most .you got your wipes and your diapers .now a way that i do. [CLS] [SEP]it is i always say one diaper for one hour. [CLS] [SEP]so if i 'm going out for a couple diapers i will take four diapers because i have two babies .then you have your toys just whatever you might need to keep them occupied with and whatever clothing that you need that is appropriate to the weather for where you live .here is cold. [CLS] [SEP]so we got our gloves and some little fleece jackets and some jeans .just a full outfit and socks .a book .i have the front part as my food compartment and in this way most of the jansports backpacks i have been pretty impress with because they have good liners in them. [CLS] [SEP]so you have some spillage in the food compartment. [CLS] [SEP]they. [CLS] [SEP]it does n't leak through where your clothing is .that is pretty nice .so we just travel with goldfish , and little gummies , snacks , and i use this playtex sippy cups and what i always do two different sizes. [CLS] [SEP]so i know what is in what .you know you can put the milk in the big ones and the water in the small ones .what ever however you want to do it .then i have this little compartment. [CLS] [SEP]and it is kind of my medicine. [CLS] [SEP]you know those types of important things like your destine to clean your diaper rash .if you are out and you spike a fever you got some tylenol .there is a lot of neat compartments in the backpack that people do n't think about that you have a little spot for your thermometer and spots for your spoons. [CLS] [SEP]it is all separate .even nail clippers when you need them and other than that the front. [CLS] [SEP]i do n't have much in that so as you can see there is quiet a bit that you could fit into a backpack. [CLS] [SEP]and it is just so handy for walking around with .
and we are going to set the saw to where we think 90 degrees should be .go ahead and tighten it .next we are going to turn our saw upside down. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to raise the lower guard. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to place a square up to the blade to see if it is square .as i place this square next to the blade , it will show me how far off my saw is .now since you can see a little bit of light through there , it tells me that it is a little bit off so what i am going to do is loosen my bevel adjustment knob and try to straighten the blade out a little bit .now that i have adjusted my blade i am going to check it again. [CLS] [SEP]and it is still a little bit off ;probably about 1 to 2 degrees. [CLS] [SEP]so i am going to go ahead and adjust it again. [CLS] [SEP]and i am going to continue this until i have a perfect 90 degree angle blade .
this is blues with voice leading example four .basically the conclusion .the whole thing .so let 's go over it .now this is just an example of voice leading .i recommend you try this with blues in every key , as well as all the standards you know .
and today we are here to talk about what to look for in choosing a treadmill .first thing you want to make sure that the treadmill itself is going to meet classification or specifications of the user .namely weight and height , those are paramount in what you decide and choose in a treadmill .as soon as we cover that then we need to decide what are our goals as far as what we expect to get out of our treadmill .are we just going to be walking , maybe some light jogging on the treadmill or are we going to be doing some more labor intensive activities like running .and some interval exercises on a treadmill , those can also effect what we are , what we should look for in a treadmill .number three in the world of treadmills the old adage you pay for what you get and does , apply however .so typically the more expensive the treadmill the higher the quality that you are going to receive and also look for a name brands that are recognizable and ones that have a reputation in the industry as being reliable over time .and lastly a good warranty on a treadmill is a very good indicator of number one , how supportive the company is behind their product that it puts out and number two. [CLS] [SEP]what kind of life span you could expect to get out of your treadmill over the course of time .they are a big investment but it can be a very worthwhile investment if you are willing to put in the time. [CLS] [SEP]and they are a wonderful as far as to have at home because it makes it so much more convenient as far as when we can get in our workouts. [CLS] [SEP]and so we do n't have to fight and stand in line at the gym .again this is aaron at the fitness for life in wilmington and that 's how to choose a treadmill .
today we 're going to talk about how to remove natural way hair from face , facial hair .the best way i like is threading and natural way .it 's the old ancient people use to use this technique .i just tie the thread on my neck and then twist the thread like four , five or six times , like this .and like this we 're going to remove the hair , facial hair naturally .this is perfect way to remove hair .i know you 're going to be a little bit in pain , but that 's okay .and this is the way , natural , to remove the hair .and also sometimes the thread get tear off , and i 'm going to replace thread again , and i tie it to my thread on my neck area. [CLS] [SEP]and we just twist the thread five , six or seven times , whatever you want , and do like that on the skin .you see , it pulls the skin a little bit , and this is the way to remove the hair naturally .i love this technique .sometimes after that you could use alcohol to close the skin pores .and this is the way naturally remove the hair from facial .
now we look at the last two options .this is by far and away the most difficult of the game , certainly more difficult than tricks or nullos or queens or what have you .if you look at this hand closely , we can certainly say for example that we would never call queens with a hand like this because we are going to take a lot of queens .the reason that this hand is ideal is that it has the tops and the bottoms and the escape cards which are the deuces .okay , that means that there will be a point in this hand when you can shed this hand absolutely positively by trick number eleven .and here is the plan , here is how you would play last two with this hand .again , why would you call last two ?because you have the tops and the deuces .not the threes , per say , the deuces .the deuces enable you to escape the hand .you have to make the effort to count the suites , that is the whole thing you have to make sure your deuce is not an established card .you start with the king of clubs and you just keep plowing that suite through until you get that ace out , okay .they will play the ace , nobody is going to hold on to the ace .they may hold on to it a couple of times but sooner or later you are going to rip through to the ace .then if you get thrown back in with , let us a say , a spade. [CLS] [SEP], you are going to start with the queen of hearts .
now that we have our grid pattern laid out with henna , what we 're going to do is we 're going to do a holly design directly on the henna over that , kind of making the leaves come up the fingers and stretch across the hand .we 'll have a couple of leaves going this way and a few going down this way .later we 'll connect them with some berries .there we go .we have the holly on there .then we 'll fill in some of the leaves , making the outline a little bit thicker .
your initial shooter will receive five dice and he can choose two of the five .this is the puck .the puck is a courtesy for the guest to help remember what they 're shooting for .in this particular case he would be shooting for a six .the puck is turned off when either the six or the point , the shooter is shooting for is made or they crap out .an example of a general bankroll .bankrolls are made up of either valued checks , usable pretty much anywhere in the casino or possibly non-valued checks .
we start with the sur place 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 , basic movement forward , basic movement backward , sur place once again , and back , sur place , 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 , basic movement forward , basic movement backwards , and sur place once more , attack 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 , and sur place 2 ,3 ,4 , and then chasse to the right .it 's 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 , chasse to the left 3 ,4 and from here we can do the traveling spin 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,1 ,2 ,3 ,4.finishing in a promenade position. [CLS] [SEP]and then finally we can do our huits. [CLS] [SEP]1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,1 ,2 ,3 ,4 .
m going to take you through a handstand forward roll .this is very essential to teach your athletics how to keep a nice tight body .a lot of people have a hard time with this exercise , it looks very simple but if you lose at all you are not going to be able to get back to your feet .i ?m going to combine a handstand and the forward roll together .once i reach the handstand position. [CLS] [SEP]i ?m going to tuck my head and roll and then reach my hand forward and stand back up in a vertical position .it is very important that i reach the handstand first cause. [CLS] [SEP]a lot of people do n't quiet reach that vertical position and they roll anyways. [CLS] [SEP]and they have not done the skill .so this is a handstand forward roll which is a really good indicator into how tight your athletics body is .so i ?m going to stretch and step. [CLS] [SEP], go into my handstand just as i have for the handstand props , the handstand snap down and just a handstand drill .this is called a handstand forward roll .
so for exercise number eight here , we 're going to be hitting the abdominals .now this is a tough one to hit .you see a lot of people just doing crunches with bad form , probably not really hitting the abs too well .so i 'll show you a good way to hit them .now i like to just do regular crunches on a ball here .you should have a ball at your gym .and now what you want to make sure you 're doing is just keeping the lower back on the ball. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're just going to put the arms behind the head .you 're going to get that nice stretch in the abs. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to crunch right up as you exhale .get that nice stretch in the abs and crunch right up .just really squeeze the abs at the top of the movement .you do about twelve of those , you really start to feel it .i 'd aim for about eight to twenty range for those .you can always increase the difficulty .you can keep the arms over the head as you do them , and you can even start to hold a weight in your hands with your arms over your head , and that 'll just increase the difficulty a lot .another thing you could do too if you just want to switch it up is do some bridges .you 're just lying on the floor , feet flat , you can lock that stomach , hands flat on the floor , and you 're just going to come right up slowly and really contract the glutes at the top .just make sure you 're nice and straight here .and then back down slowly and up slowly .and i 'd go for about the twelve to twenty range in those. [CLS] [SEP]and you 'll really start to feel it in the abs .
and i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]a bartender and vodka connoisseur here at beak 's old florida. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to tell you what 's the best vodka for the price .now for me it comes down to taste , versatility , how easy it blends with anything i want to do it with , and of course how expensive it is .for me all of those are summed up in skyy .skyy vodka , fairly inexpensive , you can usually get it from anywhere around eleven dollars to fifteen dollars in most your grocery stores and liquor stores .some of the best things about it are going to be the flavor , affordability , and accessibility .you can find it almost anywhere .so my suggestion is next time you 're throwing a party and want to bring that vodka home , go out to any liquor store , look for the clear , easily distinguished blue bottle of skyy vodka. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's a can not miss for the price .so , my name is jeff klein , vodka connoisseur and bartender here at beak 's old florida. [CLS] [SEP]and that is the best vodka for the price .
a great way to open up your hips and come into the rhythm of your breath is with sufi circles .you can do this alone. [CLS] [SEP]but it is really fun to do it with a partner .again you start seated back to back in your easy seating pose .now it 's an opposition breath so as i come forward , gina is going to be leaning back. [CLS] [SEP]and then we are actually going to be making circles , circling the body around and as gina leans forward , i 'm going to lean back opening my chest , good. [CLS] [SEP], so we 're going to come into the breath. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's going to be an opposition. [CLS] [SEP]so when i 'm inhaling , she 's exhaling .you want to talk to your partner , you want to make sure you 're not putting so much pressure that you knock your partner over , you always want to be mindful of your partner , good. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 'll do one more circle in this direction. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 're going to come back in the opposition direction , good .you want to maintain the contact of the shoulder blades. [CLS] [SEP]so you have got to make sure that you do n't come down too low so that you lose your partner .you always want to maintain that connection with your breath as well as with your partner .so we 'll come around for two more times like that , it really feels great on our hips .this is very centering as well .
run , run , run .let 's look at the next page .that was said what the words are .jump , child does n't know the next word .so what can you do when you come to a word you do n't know ?it 's important that you have the strategies to teach your child .you tell them to look at the pictures for clues .if we go back to seeing spot run or jump .for example we 're back at the page ; what is the doggy doing ?what is the doggy doing ?he 's jumping .look at the pictures for clues and then go back into the text ; jump , try sounding it out .blend your sounds .let 's try it together .spot , here 's jump spot .so look at pictures for clues .another strategy ; skip unknown words .even in high school when you 're taking tests , a lot of times teachers will tell you , if it does n't come to you immediately go back to that question .same thing with reading. [CLS] [SEP], skip the unknown word and read to the end of the sentence .let the child skip the word that is difficult .for example ; spot can not jump and play .maybe they did n't know what the word jump meant .spot can not ( skip the word it 's okay ) and play .now let 's see what this word means .go to the picture for clues .start sounding it out .but it 's okay to tell them to skip it and go back .what word would make sense ?we saw that the dog jumped , so that would make sense. [CLS] [SEP]and we sounded it out .but do n't ever get upset with your child or lose patience and tell them immediately what the word is , help them learn to decode and practice skills to figure it out .
so with the feet angled correctly and the forward knee directly over the ankle and the kneecap over the second toe , bring your hands to prayer position at the heart , relaxing the shoulders back and just noticing , if you 're feeling any torque or tension in that forward knee or the rear knee or the ankles and you can actually come in and out of it a bit , bending the knee back and forth a few times to see if there 's anything that 's too tense , too tight , that does n't feel right .there 's a difference between stretch and pain. [CLS] [SEP]and we never want to be in pain .it 's always about no pain , all gain , so come in and out of that bent knee a couple of times and notice the rear leg .notice how the forward leg feels , until you feel in a comfortable position with those alignments that we 've mentioned .rear foot forty to forty-five degree angle , forward foot ninety degree ankle , angle rather with the knee directly above the ankle and the kneecap directly above the second toe and in prayer position making sure that there 's ease in the pose , even if there 's stretch , there 's ease .
and i am going to demonstrate how we do a woodchopper .it is just like it sounds , you are going from your hand straight across to your ankle .so just think about chopping your ankle with your hand .the benefits are in the obliques , so we are working the internal and external obliques .you are going to feel that stress all the way across those abs .it is a great exercise .to modify this , you are going to bend your knee on the outside leg .the inside leg we are going to point the foot. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to come up. [CLS] [SEP]and we are just going to reach up , touch the ankle , and then come back down .the elbow is going to push down into the floor , and you are just going to lift up as high as you comfortably can and then relax down .it is an exhale. [CLS] [SEP]as you lift , it is an inhale as you lower .to intensify this move , you are going to straighten both legs out .the arm is going overhead .we are going to extend this arm out laterally now .we are coming all the way up , chop , and all the way back down .it is an exhale. [CLS] [SEP]as you lift , twist , try to get that full range of motion so that you are actually turning your hips like you are trying to get your right hip to your left knee , big twist over , and reach .so exhale , twist , inhale , lower .relax your neck .if you feel pressure in your neck , and you want to try this here , hands go behind your head , we are just going to lift up and come back down .make sure that your elbows are out nice and wide , you are pushing off the elbow on the floor , open up the chest wall , and then bring it down .so a couple of ways to modify this move .bent leg , elbow into the floor , and each up and back down .or you can go just straight leg , so. [CLS] [SEP]about an intermediate level , cross over and come back .your advanced version is to take the hand out to the side , come up and chop that ankle .and that is how we do a woodchopper .
time to work on our smoked salmon canapes .now , i 've seen these canapes done where they were on very crispy rye bread that had clearly gone into the oven to become almost cracker-like , and it was so awkward to eat , because you bit into it and sort of half the salmon slid off and half of -- anyways , it was a mess .so i 've decided that what i really like is what they call european bread at my grocery store , and it 's this grainy texture , and it 's sort of , strong enough of a bread that it can hold the salmon. [CLS] [SEP]and yet it 's not as crispy as a cracker , so you do n't have trouble eating it .so i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]just using a little cookie cutter , and i find that i can usually get at least two , but sometimes if i position it properly , three rounds out of this .see how it just comes out really cleanly like that , and then you can discard of those scraps .do a few more here .little bit of effort , but its well worth it so that your guests do n't have a hard time with your appetizers .and what i 'm going to do is spread some creme fraiche on each canape .now creme fraiche , i mean , look at the texture of this .it is , it 's like a sour cream. [CLS] [SEP]but it has a bacterial culture in it. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's much. [CLS] [SEP], it 's not as thick , and it 's got this velvety texture that you just do n't get with -- sort of the more gelatinous sour creams .so i 'm just going to take some of this wonderful creme fraiche , spread quite generously , on each canape .just a little bit of salmon that we 'll put on top of each .and what goes so well with salmon is some dill , so i 'm just going to get. [CLS] [SEP]-- unfortunately , the dill is not in season at the moment , so you can just shake a little dry dill on top there .and now , we 're ready to get the smoked salmon and then drape it on top of each little canape .
when you are looking at pink luster another shape that i wanted to talk about because a lot of people like to just collect cups and saucers .in here we have some cups and saucers which during that period they called these tea bowls also. [CLS] [SEP]and i can show you also a nice example here of a nice deep bowl in the house pattern. [CLS] [SEP]and you have a small mug here also with a house pattern .that is one example of pink luster .here you have a handle cup and saucer in the it has a grape leaf pattern. [CLS] [SEP]and you just different triangular shape to it with the center bowl. [CLS] [SEP]and this is a nice example of pink luster and in really nice condition. [CLS] [SEP]so that 's is another example that you might see in a cup .a later cup that you might see is you can see the luster it has a shine to stand you when you put it up to a light. [CLS] [SEP]it is very thin you can see through it almost a pasty consistency to it. [CLS] [SEP]so it is a very fine cup with a lot of detail on the inside .you are looks at a little house pattern again with a little bit of discoloration but not much .so this is another nice example. [CLS] [SEP]and i want to show you also the saucer that goes with it .really pretty pattern , nice and clean , with not a lot of ware. [CLS] [SEP]and that is really a nice example of what you want to look for when you are collecting these and paying top price for something like this .so look for the nice pattern with not a lot of ware on it , at least it should be relative to how much you pay for it .so those are a couple of examples .let me show you down here is another example of that set pink luster. [CLS] [SEP]it is a really nice. [CLS] [SEP]it has a nice deep bowl to it .there is a little bit of discoloration not discoloration but bumpiness to it that is to a glaze that was part of the making. [CLS] [SEP]so. [CLS] [SEP]that is a nice example of a pink luster cup and saucer .let me show you another cup and saucer here with a different design and pattern to it. [CLS] [SEP]there is one right here. [CLS] [SEP]and it has very little pattern on the outside and on the inside. [CLS] [SEP]is where you see the pattern .this basket pattern is really typical of that period to with the flowers in the basket .this has nice color you can see the luster on the outside and the outside here. [CLS] [SEP]does n't have much color. [CLS] [SEP]you can see the paste all the ware through you can see the cup and in the inside you see the nice pattern .so that is another different type of cup and saucer that you might find out there. [CLS] [SEP]so here is a few examples of what you might find in pink luster .
so , now that we 've created the base for our lizard we 're going to give it some shape .shape in the head and shape in the body .remember that this is a sculpture. [CLS] [SEP]so we want to be able to view it from all sides .that means that it has to have dimension .so , what we 're going to do is we 're going to attach the pipe cleaner to the side of the head , remembering that this top circle here is the head , so that it 's extended out like this .what we 're going to do is we 're just going to loop it around , because want to give it some frame for the papier-m ?ch ? ; which we 'll eventually do .i 'm going to do that by kind of wrapping it around .it does n't have to be perfect .again , this is going to be covered up , but we want to make sure that it 's strong enough to hold the papier-m ?ch ? .this could take one or two pipe cleaners to really give you a strong structure for creating the head and the body .so , we 're going to continue to wrap this around .i 'm probably going to need one more going in the opposite direction on the head ; something in this direction here .i 'm going to wrap it up like this and back down to the head .that 's going to give us the shape for the head .we 're going to do the same thing for the body , but more in a zigzag motion across the back .
it 's a crucial step in the process .it will save you a lot of time and energy so that you know the property you are looking at is property that you are qualified to buy and not looking at things that wo n't work for you , whether they 're too small and do n't , and you 're qualified to buy more than them or if they 're too expensive. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're not qualified to buy those at all .this is a condo and that is a great example of having a lender that can meet your specific needs .not all lenders can lend on condo purchases .some strictly do single family dwellings so that would be an important thing to know going in and can be a big part of your pre-approval process .
hi now you 're going to learn what you will need to take an awesome belly dance class .well first of all you need to feel comfortable .i recommend this kind of pants , that is cotton cause it makes your body breathe more , and also this is the classic coin belt to make a mean shimmy , and in belly dance. [CLS] [SEP]you have you have the option to do a bare feet or when you 're performing you can wear heels. [CLS] [SEP]and you can also wear ballet slippers. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's pretty much optional and depends how comfortable you would like to feel .so this is the perfect outfit for belly dance .
immediate means immediate in the sense of getting your money in an income stream .once you have a lump sum of money and you want to keep it for the future , but you only want to receive a payment that is for your budget , in other words , you turn it into an immediate annuity .an insurance company is a company that does this .for example , if you take a hundred thousand dollars based on your age , you want to receive an income stream for ten years , twenty years , or for your entire life , that 's what the insurance company will do .they 'll keep the balance of the money back growing at an interest rate , while you take a payment for your budget going forward , therefore making your money last a lot longer .if you had the money in your own care and attention during that period of time you might run the risk of well , blowing the money or spending it on something that you end up with very little principle .this is a safe way to put the money in the hands of a financial custodian for your financial future .keep in mind that while the annuity money is with the insurance company , the only time you pay taxes on , is when you take your payment out at the ordinary rate of income tax .it 's a better way to make your money last longer , using immediate annuities .i 'm financial planner patrick munro .
once you 've got your tent laid out , you need to gather all the poles that come with the tent and lay them out. [CLS] [SEP]so you can sort through them and get them all set up .most tents have two to three sets of poles , they come in different lengths for different tents .some tents have poles , that have bungee cords ran through them so that they stretch. [CLS] [SEP]and they just pop right together once you unfold them .these are real easy to put together , you just fold them out , and they go right together .the other type of poles do n't have bungee running through them and they just , you have to force them together .some have clips , that you lock them together , others do n't .when you do put your poles together , they all come with ferrules .this is when the poles is a certain diameter to a certain point , and then it gets skinnier so you can insert it into the other pole .these poles hold up and last a really long time .when you do set up your poles , if you notice a crack , a break , a bend , this is a great time to fix it .you can normally take bends out of the poles by just slowly bending them back into place .if you have a crack or a tear in your pole , you can take duct tape , wrap it around there so that the crack does n't increase .and also , if it is broken in half , you can do a field repair by taking a strong stick , a metal stake , and duct taping that to put your pole back together .and this is how to put the poles together for setting up your tent .
now that our water 's come to a rolling boil , we 'll add the fettuccine .and we 've added salt and water to it .and so we 'll let that sit .now we 're going to go on and clean our shrimp .so we 're going to need a small container to put the shells in .and because we are dealing with shrimp .we 're going to put gloves on. [CLS] [SEP]so we do n't contaminate any of the other foods .so we 're going to start at the back. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to pull around .until the plastic part or what feels like plastic , starts to come off .and you 're also going to want to remove the tail .
yeah ,just because everybody needs to know this song .it 's one of those standard songs that if you 're going to impress your girl , it 's a good one to have on the docket .very simple song .starts with a g and just slip down your 2 fingers to the next 2 chords for the c. [CLS] [SEP]and then every once in a while i throw in a d , which is always good .then the bridge there is an e minor and it goes back to the d and the c and to the g.the strumming patterns to this song are just .up , up , up , down .up , up , up .
in this clip , we 're going to demonstrate a rip cut .rip cut is so named because you 're ripping the wood in half basically , think of it that way if you , if you want a demonic device .let 's go ahead and clamp our piece of wood to the table .i happen to be using a quick grip here. [CLS] [SEP]but you may use a c-clamp or whatever you happen to have in your shop .i 'm going to give myself a reference mark .i 'm only going to make a partial rip cut just for demonstration purposes .i 'm going to give myself a line to follow , then we 'll , i do n't know how far we 'll get. [CLS] [SEP]but , let 's just make that our line .let 's go ahead and do this .we 'll say we just need to cut out a notch , and that 's what we 'll do .now the safety on the blade will retract automatically when it hits the wood. [CLS] [SEP]but sometimes you want to. [CLS] [SEP], you want to help it by easing it back as you start to make your cut .it can help you to keep your line and not drift so much .
so we have several types of travel toys .if you 're in the car , this is a wonder wheel .this hooks up to the back seat and the child has this interactive steering wheel in which they can play lights and music .it 's basically a remote control and it makes the pictures and activities light up on the play mat .this is for 12 to 36 months when the baby is in a forward facing car seat .for an older child that likes to draw and do creativity and art , we have this splash art .there 's two sided. [CLS] [SEP]and you create pictures with water .there 's no mess , it 's safe , clean , and fun .you can carry it anywhere .that 's 12 months and up .for a different type of travel , travel on your stroller , we have the twirly whirly which connects on the bar of your stroller and it has all these little characters that crankle and make noise and little teether 's .this is great for the younger child 0 to 12 months for using the stroller .
whether you are blocking , whether you are throwing , whether you are running .it does n't matter what you 've got to have good balance .so what we 're going to do right now. [CLS] [SEP]is we want to talk about this cover man and his balance .the first thing is obviously when you are covering somebody is you want to have your feet shoulder width apart .you do n't want to have your feet in here tight , and you want to have your butt down , with a low center of gravity .and you want to stay up on your toes .that way i can bounce when my guy moves inside .i can move inside quickly .i can move to the outside quickly .i can open my hips at any point and time .so blake is going to demonstrate what it looks like here to have good balance .he 's down low .that way when i take off as a receiver , and if he 's standing flat footed or if he 's standing upright. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to be able to blow right past him .so he 's got to be down at a good stance so that as soon as i come off the line , he can adjust quickly with his feet .so it takes good balance in order to be a good cover guy .and that 's the main thing that we want to see here .on your toes , down low , he 's got his shoulders in a good position , and he 's ready now to cover .
and i 'd like to share a few tips with you .for example , when it 's really tired , hard decision to make , you might want to sleep on it .just like grandma used to say , `` when you wake up in the morning , you usually have a clear perspective on what 's going on '' .when we 're over tired , we can never make the right decision and everything seems overwhelming .so it 's best to be rested when you make this decision .the other thing you can do is distance yourself from the problem .you may need to either go out for a few hours , go take a ride , go kind of chill out and talk to friends .or , if it 's a really big problem that calls for a lot of deep internalization and thought , you may want to actually take a weekend away .alone. [CLS] [SEP]and just contemplate on this problem .some people like the more tactile techniques where you actually make a list of the pros and cons of different outcomes of the problem .so if you 're , you need to do that. [CLS] [SEP], that 's okay too , it certainly helps .but in either case , take your time when it 's a very important decision its going to have a lot of outcomes for yourself and make sure that you are rested , clear minded and put that distance behind you .good luck. [CLS] [SEP], god bless , dr. [CLS] [SEP]felicia , goodbye .
so now as we can see here that i have cleaned this photo up just a little bit and we are going to move on a bit more resizing and tweaking here .so as we can see , we have got natalie 's face , it is pretty cleaned up here. [CLS] [SEP]and i have gotten rid of all this stuff ;mangles here but that is alright i will apply a layer of mask to that later and that will actually change that up a bit .so now let 's take a look at genevra ; there we go .now if we place natalie 's face on her we can see that her face is n't quite the same size .so let 's go ahead. [CLS] [SEP]and we will resize this photo up just a little bit ; there we go .and let 's rotate this. [CLS] [SEP]just a little bit so it kind of matches a little more ; there we go .now let 's move this over to where it would set , something around in. [CLS] [SEP]there is where it would set. [CLS] [SEP]and i think i like that a lot .so what we are going to do here is we are going to readjust the cheek line on genevra and actually give her just a little bit longer of a neck here .actually , what we could have done is we could have kept natalie 's neck coming down that way what we could have resized the head and stuff but. [CLS] [SEP]that would have been a lot of photo cropping here and this is just going to be a quick tutorial .so now that we have got that we will hit enter to get out of the rotation mode on that .and let 's go ahead and we will click on genevra 's layer here .what we are going to do is we are just going to kind of clone stamp. [CLS] [SEP]this back up. [CLS] [SEP], so let 's , actually you know what , let 's go into. [CLS] [SEP], we will hit j ; we are going to go into our heal brush. [CLS] [SEP]but we are going to go into our patch tool .we are going to use our patch tool for a little bit .so come down here , the third one down is our patch tool .the way the patch tool works is if we hold down the command and space bar , we will zoom in here , what we would be allowed to do. [CLS] [SEP]is we will be allowed to make a selection like this .i do n't want to grab her hair too much , let 's just stay out of that , there we go .now if we hit options , space bar we will hit the zoom button and we can just zoom out a little bit , there we go , and what we will do is we will just click in here , drag this down and as you can see it is going to choose the colors below and release and what this will do it will , command deselect , it will actually clean this up for us quite a bit .so there we go , we have actually cleaned up her jaw line and her neck with one simple brush stroke .actually , there is a little bit more blending here that we could do. [CLS] [SEP]and i might apply this just a couple more times around here just to get these colors blended in well .but we are going to stop for here. [CLS] [SEP]and we will pick this up in the next part .
for instance if you were doing this for a bed and breakfast , some people are allergic to the starch. [CLS] [SEP]so you just want to use steam .
it needs to get some nutrients. [CLS] [SEP]and we 've created a nice acidic atmosphere to live in .but , they need a few more nutrients in that. [CLS] [SEP]and here i have a well composted dirt .this dirt started out as leaves and gardening debris and all kinds of compost type materials and now it 's broke down to where it 's nice and full of nutrients .it 's got all the microorganisms in it .it 's got all the ingredients in there that 's actually going to help break down some of this pine needles .so , what we want to do is sprinkle a little bit of this around the blueberry plant .you can even open up a little bit here where the mulch is and get some right down in there and kind of just kind of work it in .you get this nice compost , it 's well balanced .got plenty of nutrients for the plant so that it 's all during april and may , it can grow and thrive and produce beautiful , beautiful berries .
we can also create texture with a variety of finishes that they use in the faux finish painting to create textures and there 's no reason why you ca n't use it in your artwork .a lot of these involve putting on the paint and then taking it off. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm going to make ,i 've got lots of this here .so for example , generally do n't want so i 'm going to put it like this .now you have to work fast because this stuff does you can start playing with this. [CLS] [SEP]again this is something you need on a hard surface .this these kind of items will not work on a canvas , these will not work on a flexible surface. [CLS] [SEP]so this is basically you 're putting on the paint. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 're taking it off .i 'm also going to show. [CLS] [SEP]you know you can rag this on or rag it off .we 're going to rag it off and. [CLS] [SEP]what you do is you just press your rag on the paper and you 're going to get this very beautiful .as long as you do n't get fingerprints you do n't really want fingerprints so make sure you get those out. [CLS] [SEP]but you get a very subtle patterning .you know you do n't always want your paint to be flat you know to be just a flat color .you can see. [CLS] [SEP]in there you 're starting to get this really nice kind of variation .i have to say that if you 're going to do this with acrylics be sure to buy a retarder and acrylic retarder .it 's an additive that you put in your acrylic paint so that it has a longer dry time , it wo n't dry so quickly .the faster this dries the more problems you have. [CLS] [SEP]so you really need to get a slow drying paint and make sure that you do n't have a heat source or a fan blowing on your work while you 're doing this .
so , as we begin today , i 've chosen just a piece of cardboard , thin cardboard to use as my backing .so , we 'll be adhering things just onto this and that will be the platform for the collage .so , i think today ,i 'm just going to go for a sort of travel/map theme because i have a lot of maps and stuff to use .and again , there are no rules with this .whatever you have to use , you can , or you can search out whatever kind of crazy ideas you have .i 'm just going to go through this , and flip through , and see what catches my eye .whatever catches your eye and whatever you think might look good .here 's a nice little pull-out map , actually .i think i might use this to begin .and again , you do n't have to have everything pre-selected .you can kind of go as you like .you can pre-select things , if you want and have it layed out before you adhere it to that .i 'm using scissors here. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm just going to cut out this map as straight as i can .and again , there are no rules .i like things to be in straight lines .a lot of times , to have corners , and edges , and 90 degree angles , but feel free to get crazy and creative .i 'm just going along the edge of the map here .i like it because it has a nice 90 degree angle. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to use this as a corner .as i cut here , i 'm thinking ahead .this is going to go in the bottom right corner .and i like to make my collages with no space in between each piece. [CLS] [SEP]so i overlap them sometimes. [CLS] [SEP]or i make them abut right next to them , but you can do whatever you like .again , i usually save the scraps and put it back just in case you need it later .and here is what i 've cut out. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's probably going to go here .i 'm going to cut out and get all of my stuff assembled and then put it down and glue it down or tape it down all together .
now we are going to spray color with short strokes hand .and okay now we have to let it dry a couple of hours. [CLS] [SEP]but now you see that you have a nice finished product. [CLS] [SEP]but i recommend you to put it inside , interior .not outside because its not going to last long outside , its going to melt if it rains or something .then i hope you enjoyed the program. [CLS] [SEP]and i hope to see you next time .
okay , right now i 'm just going to open up a new file in reason , i 'm just going to show you how .we get started with adding new devices into your virtual rack .so i 'm going to go ahead and show you that right now .what you do is you come on to the file menu. [CLS] [SEP], you 'll come to new .there 's also a shortcut key for that , as you can see here , it 'll show the shortcut key for you if you 're interested in using the shortcut keys .this one 's going to be command. [CLS] [SEP]and , okay , so once you have that open , there 's a couple of ways that you can start adding devices in .now one cool thing about reason is that , reason will actually connect the devices for you once you have them placed , once you place them inside of the rack .and because , as you can see , i 'll show you in just a moment here , that , there 's many different ways to connect the devices .so , it 's nice for them to be able to at least connect them , so that you 're able to start using the device right away .right here , i 'm just going to pull the mixer out here. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to drop it down onto the virtual rack .okay .and as you can see , it 's already connected the outputs from the master out , left and right into the stereo. [CLS] [SEP]inputs for the , your mini device here .and so now , you can just start connecting devices to your mixer .and so , you know , open wherever you want .and you know , generally , that what i usually suggest is you just try to start with the mixer .it 's probably the most important thing you want to get in there .if you do n't want a large mixer like that , you can do a line mixer instead .it 's up to you .but , either way , drag and drop , it 's beautiful thing .
one. [CLS] [SEP]o eight .one o eight go ahead .how do you copy this radio .my name is sergeant carl nielson , i work with the pleasant grove police department in utah .i 've been a police officer almost eight years now , part of the responsibility of a police officer , there 's different stages , the main goal we want to make sure the community is safe .when school is in we patrol the school areas , watch where people are speeding in the area .make it safe for them whether they are walking to school or riding a bike to and from school that 's our main goal there .and officers we try to drive through the areas be seen out there. [CLS] [SEP]so we can deter any crime .and then if there is any crime out there then we possible be in the area and we can stop the individual , pull them over , make an arrest or do what we need to do to keep the community safe .it just depends on the area we also assist the community in pleasant grove as far as if they are broke down , if they lock their keys in their car. [CLS] [SEP]we help them do , unlock their cars so they can get on with their everyday errands they have to run .and it 's pretty interesting. [CLS] [SEP]it 's never the same day twice , there 's always something new happening each day .some jobs you do the same thing over and over with the , as a police officer things change minute to minute. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's pretty exciting .this a police officer there 's different rules .there 's you can start off as an officer and you work your way up through the ranks .i started off as a patrolman and then i went into the schools as a resource officer and from there i went to the detectives and. [CLS] [SEP]now i 'm a patrol sergeant .one of the things that are different between a patrolman and a detective is the patrolman takes the initial call and goes , takes the call or the case as far as he can .if he has to do follow up , go to a different city or something like that , stuff that he ca n't do , then it will get passed on to the detective and the detective takes the case from there and does the follow up .and gets more information and finishes up the case that way .so it 's kind of two parts , both officer and patrol or patrolmen and the detective work hand in hand .
hey , i feel your pain , and i 'm going to show you how that 's done .first of all , you take your vhs tape and you put it into a vhs player .it may have been a while since i 've done that .all right , now you got to ask yourself how am i going to get it over to dvd ?well , you 're going to need a dvd recorder .this particular unit here though is both of em ' in one .the price has come way down on em ' and they 're awesome .you simply do that , you 'll follow the onscreen prompt , and it did actually a one-button dub in either direction .you put a blank dvd in , a recordable blank dvd of course into the dvd side , you rewind the tape to the beginning , and then you hit one one button dub .that 's what sony calls it on theirs .now , you may not have that. [CLS] [SEP]but you have an old vhs player , and you do have a dvd recorder .let me show you how to wire that together .first of all , you want to take a look over here at the back of it , and now , while it does have some more modern connections or higher quality connections they do n't always go out or go in the way you want em ' to be .so for instance , here line out does not have a line out here .we can go out in sv , we can go out in component , we can go out in composite , but here on the second piece of equipment , the burner up top ; it only allows in in the three wire configuration with the rca 's , so we 're simply going to respect that .and it 's going to be right for red , white for left channel audio , and yellow for video .now , up here we 're going to follow the same type of configuration here .we 're going to go the video in with yellow ; should n't i just do it here visually better , the red for right channel audio , the white for left channel audio , and the yellow for video .now , now we 're all wired up. [CLS] [SEP]you just bring up , you bring up the picture , and here you go .i 'll give you a couple of tricks .all right , here 's how you do it .you take your player , your vhs , and you find where you want to start the dub or the transfer to copy .you push play and then at that point pause , all right ?you want that to be five seconds at least before you actually want it to start .then what you do is you put your blank media in the dvd recorder or burner , and you get that onto record-pause .you unpause it on the play side , wait the five seconds , unpause the record .got a nice , clean start point on your dub , and you 're ready to go .that high school reunion will be preserved forever , so your grandchildren 's grandchildren can make fun of you , like me , rokosz , your digital lifestyle expert sayin ' stream. [CLS] [SEP]ya ' later .
so , katate-tori sumiotosh .very simple .think about holding a sword , cutting .hand at the elbow , just like you 're pushing a shopping cart , we do n't push with our arms , we push with our bodies .definitely like you 're pushing a car , same thing .you can also go to the inside .just tenkan the inside , and continue moving .tenkan , slide board .okay ?
ok. [CLS] [SEP], let 's have a look at what we 've got here .we 've already inversed our quick mask selection here .what we 're going to do is we 're just going to come up here and click on this button here , which is going to add this as a layer mask .now as you can see , this is added very lightly like so .clicking it on and off .but just a little bit of frost on top like so .and now what we 're going to do is we 're going to add some ocean ripples to this .so what we 're going to do is , we 're going to click on our layer mask , like so .and , let 's see , hit ok.on that .let 's go to filter , let 's see where this is at. [CLS] [SEP], i think it 's going to be distort , like so .ocean ripple , there we go , and , let 's see our magnitude. [CLS] [SEP], let 's say we 'll set this one low , a ripple size really low .like so .let 's set our magnitude high , like that .we 'll hit `` ok. [CLS] [SEP]'' , and that 's breaking that up just a little bit , so let 's go to here and let 's do this again .let 's go to filter. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll just reapply that again , like so .and as you can see this has already broken it up nice , giving it that little bit of a grunge effect onto it like there ,like we 've got a little bit of frost .so what we 're going to do is pause right here and pick this up in the next part .
since cocktail parties tend to start rather pretty much early in the evenings and go no later than 9:00.you basically will have someone in a dress such as this where it 's not a long formal length , but cocktail parties , they usually start , the dresses start around the knee and that 's pretty much standard ; and because they go into early evening , sometimes you would have a shrug or pullover or little valero jacket that would accompany it because it could get a little chilly sometimes .but the basic concept of the cocktail dress is that you want something that 's easy , attractive , and that you can basically drink in .this is the important thing about a cocktail party dress .when you see a cocktail dress , two things you may notice is that sometimes they come in two pieces .it 's always something to have to cover yourself up in the afternoon because usually it gets a little later and a little cooler because cocktail parties tend to go from 5:00 o'clock up until no later than 9:00 , and as cotta is showing you , it 's a two piece .so , that 's what we 're doing here , and that 's what we 're showing you with the cocktail dress .
when i ask people , especially my students , what they ’ re thinking of over a 3-4 foot put , their general answer is i ’ m trying to make it .wrong answer .the right answer is i ’ m going to just swing the club at my target .anytime that you say i ’ m trying to make it. [CLS] [SEP], you ’ re making the hole the target .you ’ re creating pressure .you ’ re making an outcome , you ’ re creating an outcome .you don ’ t want to do that because it creates tension , and tension boom , ruins the stroke .think about it .90 percent of the time on a green the center of that cup is not the target .it could be the right lip , 2 inches outside the right lip .on a long put it could be 4 feet outside the left lip .the speed of the green , the slope of the land , how fast you strike a put ; that determines the break , but what you can do is swing the club at your target .what i ’ m going to do is i ’ m going to aim it at the right side .aim the club at my target , square my body , and i ’ m just going to take it back , and i ’ m going to swing my club at my target , and that ball is going to curve into the hole .i don ’ t want to create an outcome .all i really want to do is swing the club at my target .you ’ ve heard of that great word the ‘ yips. [CLS] [SEP]’. [CLS] [SEP]well the ‘ yips ’ is a person is trying to create an outcome .they ’ ve created so much tension that it ’ s really difficult to make a smooth stroke .there ’ s. [CLS] [SEP]only 2 things that can happen when you swing a putter :tou can make it or you can miss it ; and if all you do is take the club with your hands , start it back , and use your arms to swing at your target , you ’ re going to probably succeed more often than you fail .so practice this on your short puts , and i promise you , you will be a better putter .
just slightly , but it is a different , paler blue .next , i 'm gon na take my blue here. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to mix a little dab of orange in it. [CLS] [SEP]and here 's my blue with my orange which is another color here , more of a khaki color .i 'm going to wet my brush , clean it , and i 'm going to take my blue here , this time i 'm going to mix it with my purple , or my violet .and i come up with yet another color ,oh that 's a pretty color here .and , i 'm going to add a little bit more blue here. [CLS] [SEP]because i 'm going to need it later on , my palettes are getting kind of messed up now , but it 'll show you how to do this .now , i 'm going to take a little dab of my blue here. [CLS] [SEP]and this time , wet , and just a little dab of this blue here and here. [CLS] [SEP]is another green or blue-green. [CLS] [SEP]that 's different from the one above it .so these are ,i 'm adding more and more colors to my palette as i go along .stay tuned to the next segment when we mix our orange with the other primary and secondary colors .
hi i 'm les whitley .i 'd like to take a few minutes now and talk to you about how to improve your vertical jump .your vertical jump is again your ability to push force into the ground to propel your body upward overcoming the forces of gravity , traveling upward through space .knowing where you start or knowing where your vertical jump is to begin with is a great way to start .once you identify what your vertical jump is usually measured in inches you know where you want to go and how far you want to progress from as little as a gain of one inch up to three inches over the course of a six to a twelve week time frame is actually a pretty good improvement .putting force in the ground means that you have got to get stronger , utilizing exercises such as the squat , to develop a good base of power for the lower body. [CLS] [SEP]but then also maximizing the transfer of that power through incorporating exercises like the power clean or the overhead snatch. [CLS] [SEP], the olympic movements which involve very speed oriented movements to that you are maximizing that power output in minimal time .the vertical jump is a very quick movement .you are putting maximal force in a very short amount of time .the other thing becomes technique ideally setting yourself up as a spring , springing and loading yourself up into a position , not to overcompensate by staying too long in a deep position so that the muscles become taxed and fatigued .you want to set yourself up by causing a nice spring effect swinging your arms down which preloads those muscles engaging the muscles of the hips , the muscles of the lower body , the calves and then forcefully swinging your arms up high to again maximize that vertical leap so arms start up high , forceful drive down and then rebound for maximal height .
what we 're going to talk about is a general safety guideline when it comes to consumer legal fireworks .the only firework that can safely be held in the hand and lit would be the common sparkler .even though the common sparkler burns at a very high and hot temperature , it poses the hazard of burn injuries .the common sparkler can be held unlit by the user , and then lit by the ignition person or the shooter .once lit , it should be held at arms length , to prevent any type of burn injury .other types of consumer fireworks , like this fountain that sprays showers of sparks , bottle rockets , roman candles , or other types of consumer fireworks should never be held in the hand and ignited .they should be placed firmly on a flat surface , and then ignited by someone designated as the ignition person or shooter .this person should be a responsible adult .i 'm captain joe bruni .stay safe , and we 'll see ya ' next time .
different , several different ways you can get rid of the car payment .one is to obviously sell it out. [CLS] [SEP]right , two is to refinance the vehicle that a lot f secondary and even some big banks out there that will give you a new loan based on credit .you have good credit and you did n't at the time , you purchased a vehicle , or you may want to look in to that because you can save yourself some money by obtaining a new loan that has a lower interest rate .or you can maybe perhaps borrow the money from a friend or a family member and hopefully , they 'll be able to , they 'll charge you a lot less than your current note .if you 're a homeowner and you have some equity , another way that you can get rid of it is by obtaining a home equity line of credit , or a second mortgage , if that mortgage , the rate on that mortgage is going to be lower than the , than the interest rate on your car payment , then that 's certainly another way that you can go about it .either way , it will obviously get rid of your car payments .my name 's adreil torres and i 'm the owner of ultimatecredittoday.com , thank you very much .
hi .my name is mary thinnes. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm a skin care expert .now i 'm going to discuss with you proper products for home use , after treatments and when to use them .right now since she 's already had a chemical peel done i am going to put on the pure hyaluronic acid .and as i had mentioned before , pure hyaluronic acid , it 's clear in nature as you can see , is not and acid .it 's a little deceiving with the word .but it 's actually a moisturizer .so she definitely had a laser and professional treatments done .so in order to rehydrate her skin again and balance out the ph 's. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to definitely put on the hyaluronic acid .an then also i 'm going to let that dry for about 30 seconds to a minute. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'm going to go ahead and apply the sunscreen .and sunscreen is so important especially after a professional treatment because your skin now after a profession treatment is so much more sensitive and since you will be going outside and the sun most likely will be out unless you 've done the treatment at night , which is recommended in the summer time , you 'll definitely be in the sun .and like i said your skin is more sensitive to the suns exposure .so definitely put on sunscreen as well .also you 're going to use your , for hyper pigmentation. [CLS] [SEP]you 're going to be using your pigment gels at home and for anti aging skin , mature skin you 're going to be using your vitamin c 's .so for all different skin types you 're going to have all those products at home for home care use .
okay , being as we 're talking about balance and everything , i just want to go ahead and support why it 's so important to me about this ninety degree angle , or more. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm slightly over it because i want to be on top of the drums .but , getting right back to the feet , same position as before , so it 's important to me , no matter what i do , going back and forth between these two feet , i 'm not losing my balance with my torso .so , i 'm not having , i 'm not leaning , when i hit the bass drum i do n't lean into the note or , if i hit the hi hat , it 's not making me feel awkward .and , sometime , if you 're playing some complicated music , it 's very easy to get off balance .so , i work on making sure , whatever i do , i feel comfortable from the ground up because it keeps me where i need to be. [CLS] [SEP]and it keeps me in my comfort zone. [CLS] [SEP], i feel i play better that way .so , basically , i talked firstly about the hi hat. [CLS] [SEP]and then the bass drum. [CLS] [SEP], now i 'm going to combine the two and just show you how the balance , i 'm working on keeping it stable .okay , this is a new orleans groove ; just with the feet because it 's going to do a combination of both techniques and not throwing off my balance. [CLS] [SEP]is the goal i shoot for when i use different techniques with the feet .so , basically , the groove goes like this .okay ,so , if you noticed , i tried to go back and forth between the two techniques with this with my left foot .i was on the toe , and then i threw the heel down , so. [CLS] [SEP]i was doing that a little bit with this .and this one , i was mostly on my toe the whole time .now , anything i practice , i try to make sure that i can do it more than just one way .if i 'm working on a rock groove , i learn it this way .i learn it this way .then i 'll reverse the feet .sometimes this foot will go this way , but this one will be the opposite .i want to make sure that that coordination does n't throw off what my ideas that are flowing up here .so , everything i go to practice , i try to mix up as many different combinations of this and making sure that my balance is still there .
you tend to find it kind of washes out a little bit .where if i do the same thing with the gold one , it changes the whole look of it .you start to see the white and not the frame .these come in different sizes .there are 3 different sizes laying out here of these .there are lots of different silvers whether it is patina with a little bit of black or very shiny or if it is a has a little gold in it .these little piece right here the gray part in it is called a patina. [CLS] [SEP]it is a powdery process that is put on with a little bit of glue it gives it a little bit of oldie look to it .they are all very simple frames , they would all go around mostly anything .it takes a special person to honor a gold frame it is not something , it is not my first chose .i 'm not. [CLS] [SEP]a gold person , i 'm more of a earthy person. [CLS] [SEP]so i lean towards the woods. [CLS] [SEP]but there is a lot more fancier people out there that want this gold .it tends to give them the pallet that they need .
what about your art makes you passionate ?one of the things in finding your message and finding your story that 's so important , is that if you know where your art came from .and you know what kind of things go into your art , it ’ s going to be so much more powerful if you have something to say .if you just feel like you want to make art , just to make art for arts sake , then why is it going to matter ?it ’ s not going to matter to you .it ’ s not going to keep you going when times get tough .this is an incredibly important part of marketing .because if you do n't realize , if you do n't know what your core value is .what you are committed to .what you 're going out to try and perform .what you are trying to change the world by doing .you 're going to be much more likely to give up when the going gets tough .let me promise you , the going will get tough .there will be times when you are making very little money for doing what you really love to do .and then your heart will go , man am i failing at what i really want to do ?what i really love to do .so , what are you passionate about ?find it .go and find that thing .man. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm passionate about seeing people come alive when they hear my words .suddenly something amidst them says , man i can do that too .i can be who i was made to be .i want to do that .man. [CLS] [SEP]i am passionate about that .all right .i love talking about that .you see me come alive when i start to talk about it .you need to find that thing .because that thing will keep you going when nothing else will .
154.we 're going to continue dealing now with our second engagement , on the first attacker .let 's take it that far .we have one , and then two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine parrying the blade down , ten , eleven. [CLS] [SEP], then we did our tsuki and off the line .and then we did our yokomenuchi , which they saw ,started to parry , and we drew our jo down .the jo now is locked back behind me , my hips are low , and they 're for all intents and purposes , they 're loaded up , they 're cocked .as their blade moves through now , i 'm going to draw this out like i would a sword , and snap them in the ribs .so it 's this motion right here .here , boom .catch them right on the ribs .so let 's take it from here .at turn , beat the blade down , tsuki to the eyes , a reverse yokomen , i come into tsuki ,i 'm off the line .i come yokomenuchi. [CLS] [SEP], i draw it down , they continue moving through , snap to the ribs .that will take us that far in jo gi one. [CLS] [SEP]
hi , this is doc lowry .when you 're , complete your tattoo , they 're ... [CLS] [SEP]clean your machine by disassembling the needle and the tube assembly like this , and we drop them into soak and bleach water soak .they soak in there for a while and that cleans all that off. [CLS] [SEP]and then the equipment. [CLS] [SEP]then , we can just spray down and the body of the machine frame , and rinse it off , and then dry it. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's ready for your next service .the , when you 're finished with a tattoo then , the needle goes into a sharps container that 's full of used tattoo needles , and they just collect there until they 're ready for disposal , and that gets ... [CLS] [SEP]and that gets thrown out .the tube part goes through a sterilization process and we 'll go over here and show you how that works .after thee tattoo is completed and the tube is soaked in some bleach water , then let 's move to an ultra-sonic cleaner and they 're where they 're just dropped in this basket and they , and then they ... [CLS] [SEP]have sound waves that vibrate any residue off the remainder of the tube , and they clean in there .just a soap solution .and then after they 've been in there , they go into the autoclave .an autoclave is very similar to just a , oh , okay , well here 's some tools here. [CLS] [SEP]i just cleaned , to a pressure cooker , and this one even looks like a pressure cooker .but the tubes are bagged , just like these tools are into sterilization bags , and the bags are chemically treated so that they change color .and you can see , here 's some jewelry that 's been prepared for sterilization. [CLS] [SEP]and so it changes from pink to gray. [CLS] [SEP]so you know that the transformation has taken place .and then ... [CLS] [SEP]and then it cooks in here for an hour .here 's a pair of tubes that have been all bagged up and ready to be autoclaved , and so they go in there. [CLS] [SEP]and then they get sterilized. [CLS] [SEP]and then the tube part , and the handle part , is ready to do another tattoo .
they smaller and they wo n't fall through and the flush is really , really low to the ground. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's really easy for them to do it themselves which is a sign of independence for them too that they 're able to do it .for those of you who ca n't install mini potty. [CLS] [SEP]cause. [CLS] [SEP]i know they 're pretty pricey , you can go to toys r ' us and by a fisher price portable potty .kids really like them when you flush the toilet it sings a song or it makes a noise. [CLS] [SEP]and they get real excited .so they look really , really forward to doing that .
these 3m compound brushes i use too , as well .the red ones , not quite as coarse and so , what i 'll do is ,and of course , you see the white one. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's more of a coarse .so , if you got something , let 's say you cast a piece , it 's got a big sprew , which is at the base that you are to cut off when the metal goes into the ring. [CLS] [SEP]and you got a big piece there. [CLS] [SEP]you really need to grind off .then , these more coarse ones work to remove the metal quicker .well , we 're not really trying to remove metal , we 're just trying to remove some of the marks from the piercing saw .so , i 'll use a lighter grade and. [CLS] [SEP]i just put it on the end of the spindle here and give it a good turn .so , basically , you hold it. [CLS] [SEP]and you can tell that. [CLS] [SEP]when i make my move around it , the parts that i 'm doing are becoming more smooth .and if you just want to do this more of a straight away , there 's not , your not really trying to put an edge on there. [CLS] [SEP], we 're just trying to make the metal more smooth .and you know , sometimes , when you come around the corner with a piercing saw , you 're not exactly totally perfect with that .well , this wheel right here will make it to where you can round that part out .so , this is a real helpful tool right here , this little 3m abrasive mat wheel .and that 's basically all i 'll do .so , as you can tell on the sides , it 's getting smoother and smoother every bit of a step and stage that we do .
in this clip on `` how to run your own music business '' i 'm going to talk about the benefits of either working with a music school or breaking out on your own as a freelance music teacher .there can be a lot of benefits to starting with a music school at the very beginning .there 's a lot of music schools and they 'll pay you , and you might make less per hour than on your own , but you 're going to have the benefit of working with other staff members , other teachers , getting tips and ideas .the administrator will deal with cancellations and collecting monies. [CLS] [SEP]so i really recommend when you first decide to be a music teacher to join a music school , even if it 's just for a year .and it will give you great initiation , and. [CLS] [SEP]then it 's maybe time to break out as a freelancer , try and advertise , and get your own students .but i learned so much from working within music schools .i got tips from other teachers , i got all different kinds of students i might not have been able to work with , to get on my own through my own advertisement , and i did n't have to worry about the money in the beginning .so , i suggest that for the very beginning to work with a school .
next i 'm going to go over some different techniques that i use to edit my midi data .when editing midi data , there 's a lot of different tools , and a lot of different tool boxes within pearl tools that helps you and kind of gives you short cuts as far as editing .but usually the best way to do is really just to go in and manually edit certain things .so what i 'm going to do is show you how to manually go in and fix certain mistakes and edit certain things as far as like recording data and trying to split up the notes and trying to separate things and really get everything really organized in a good way. [CLS] [SEP], you can see it and manipulate it in a way that 's very easy to do .when doing this in recording the midi data , you got to remember that the midi data is just data that tells the computer what to play or tells keyboard what to play and the midi data is not actually sound .it triggers the sound within certain sound modules and certain machines and things like that , but the midi data is very useful as far as like controlling the data and manipulating the data .you can also use that data in other machines and transfer all the things you manipulated and all the little velocities and durations and attacks and releases , you can bring all that to another platform and use it .and that 's why it 's so powerful .
has a nice lacy look to it. [CLS] [SEP], let me show you some of the some of the piece made with the finer hemp that you find in a beading store , this one starts with a square knot .it carries several beads , it has an example of the spiral knot and the finer hemp. [CLS] [SEP]and then it ends with the braid , and. [CLS] [SEP]you can see it , it makes a much more delicate but still a natural look .here 's one with a square knot. [CLS] [SEP]and you can see how nice the square knot looks with the even and fine hemp thread .
many games have been won and lost at the free throw line .hi. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm travis and. [CLS] [SEP]this is how to shoot a free throw .first of all what you want to do is once everyone 's lined up at the free throw line. [CLS] [SEP], you want to step and put your foot right in the center of the basket .usually on many courts there 's a dot right in the center. [CLS] [SEP]and you can find it. [CLS] [SEP], there 's one right here. [CLS] [SEP]and it just happens to be on this outside court .you find it , you put your foot right in the middle of it , get the ball ready , preparing your hands , bend your knees. [CLS] [SEP]that 's important and then once you bend your knees. [CLS] [SEP]you want to put the , put your hand in the center of the ball .a lot of these mechanics are the same as just a regular jump shot .put your hand in the center of the ball , other hand , the other hand on the outside , raise your arm and elbow , elbow straight on the basket and when you release it 's all one fluid motion .so it should look a little something like this .make sure you 're snapping your wrist. [CLS] [SEP]so the ball has a backwards rotation .there you have it , that 's shooting a free throw .
okay , so as you can see , we 've hogged out a lot of the interior from our bowl now , and we 've gotten down to the point of our drilled mark .and here i want to now take a measurement of my wall thickness .this is a set of calipers , that can be used to measure the outside and the inside at the same time , just by running along through here .and it can give me my measurement on the end as well .now what , right now i 'm running this tip on the outside of the bowl , and i see i 'm. [CLS] [SEP], i 've got wall , plenty of room there , but once i get down to the bottom of the bowl , that touches .that tells me that the bottom of the bowl is still thicker in the outside .and when you 're working with green wood , especially with green wood you want to have uniform wall thickness .because if this is thicker than this , this is going to dry faster than this area and that 's going to cause cracking .and you do n't want your bowl going to crack after you spent this much time with it .here 's another way to check some wall thicknesses , now remember i said earlier , we took a one and three quarter inch to one and seven eights inch depth .this is a homemade depth gauge , nothing more than a metal bar and a piece of wood with a hole drilled in it and a thumbscrew to lock it into place .and it will slide in and out .
how ya doing there .i 'm simon bingham , and this is no comply skateboard shop , and we are located in austin , texas .i 'm going to tell you a little bit about the materials that go into a skateboard deck .first off , the most important material that goes into a skateboard deck is the wood , which is harvested from maple .it 's 'cause it 's pretty much the only kind of wood that you can use in a skateboard deck .and they have come to that conclusion up to now .throughout the sixties and seventies , they mostly used , actually , they used fiberglass , and they tried it with metal .they tried it with porcelain , they tried all different types of things , but nothing really worked like maple .and they really did n't figure out the maple until they started doing more different shapes and stuff like that , and there was n't really any malleable wood that would ... [CLS] [SEP].was able to bend , and then hold a firmness .and then the next and most important thing is the glue , which companies have developed over the years to be better and better .harder and more durable .and that 's basically the materials that go into a skateboard .
i got to give several keys out .so what we 're going to do is we 're going to put these identifying little covers on the keys .but the only problem is these do n't quite fit .so it looks i need to grind off , just a little bit off of each of these keys .so how we 're going to do. [CLS] [SEP]that is , i 'm going to take a pair of pliers and the body grinder .and i 'm going to take the body grinder , now this is a dangerous tool .this is powerful , it 's got a disc that spins really fast on here , and you need to grip it firmly .and what i 'm going to do is basically grind off a little bit off of the key , like this .okay ,so now that we 've ground off a little bit off that we 're going to see if this little key cover will fit on here now .let 's see .no , i think ,well maybe .yeah. [CLS] [SEP]that looks like that ?ll work .and so now we have. [CLS] [SEP], that 's what we 're going to do to the other keys also .and now , if you follow these simple steps you too will be able to change out your door lock on your commercial door , thanks to expert village .
i 'm jeanna rock , and we 're discussing how to lead a book discussion .first of all , make sure that you read the book .and encourage the other members of your group to read it as well .i know that sometimes it 's hard for us to get through a novel in a month , or whatever the time limit is , but it 's hard to have a discussion if everyone has n't read a novel , and quite often if the book has a surprise ending , we 're a little bit hesitant to discuss that .in our book group , the rule is we 're going to have spoilers .if you did n't read the book , that 's your problem , we 're going to talk about it , and we 're going to talk about all the surprising instances that happened as well .so make sure that everyone reads .be sure that you have a list of some questions that will lead to a good discussion , and try to tie some of those questions in with books that you 've read before as well .making those connections is very important .include everyone in your discussion .make sure that not one person sits there and does not participate at all .quite often we have people who dominate the discussion , and that is not helpful .we want everyone to participate , we want everyone 's ideas to be presented to the group .also , do n't allow people to go off too far on tangents .i know sometimes it 's very interesting and sometimes it 's enlightening to do that , but keep your discussion on the book , and leave time at the end for discussing things that do n't have anything to do with the book .
so , once we 're comfortable with that hand ghost note accent pattern , we can add the bass drum back in , maybe just on one. [CLS] [SEP]and you can start there .and , here 's a little faster .so , what you 've really got to do there , that snare hand has to stay relaxed .if you 've got tension here , you 're not going to be able to play those ghost notes .so , keep the hand loose , add the bass drum in , and play that back beat on three .
the other one as well ; from this hand too .maybe a little bit here from the hand .okay , that looks okay to me ; maybe a tiny little bit from here .
tomatoes are the number one vegetable in the country .why , well , because it 's easy to grow , and it gives you good production .everybody likes tomatoes for some of their salads , and other dishes .this tomato , of course , is one that i picked just the other day from my own little earth box , and you , of course , could have them in yours as well .tomatoes need full sun .if they do n't get six hours of bright sun a day , you 're not going to get good results .remember of course , to pick the variety that does best in your area .some of the varieties are a little bit picky when it comes to nighttime temperature .yup , nighttime temperature can affect how they flower , and how they produce .if you want the bigger fruited tomatoes , you need to make sure that you have enough warmth at night that they can flower and fruit .sometimes you 'll find some products in your local nursery that tend to help , called blossom set , especially when it 's on the cool side .tomatoes , of course are easy to grow .you may pick out some of the suckers , and make sure of course you 've either got little cherries , you 've got some of the strawberry types , or some of the large varieties , as well .tomatoes make a nice addition to the vegetable garden , and you 'll be glad that you have them .for on gardening , i 'm stan de freitas , mr. [CLS] [SEP]green thumb .
what i 'm going to talk about is how to identify that a bite has been possible caused by the black widow spider .the black widow spider will leave some type of reddening mark on the skin which will begin to swell and grow and spread in it 's redness .it could also turn purplish or black and blue relatively quickly .also some of the signs and symptoms that would go with that redness , would possibly be cramps , or muscle cramp type of feeling in that bite area spreading throughout other areas of the body .there are also maybe localized pain or pain in the abdomen and back area shortly after the bite of the black widow spider .there could also be vomiting and dizziness or heavy nausea that may occur .if any of these symptoms start to show themselves after what is a suspected bite from a black widow spider , apply ice at regular intervals about twenty minutes on and twenty minutes off , clean the site with soap and water and get the individual to medical attention where anti venom for the black widow spider can be administered .again the bite of the black widow spider would be redness , possible muscle cramping in that area , cramping in the back and abdomen , nausea , dizziness and maybe even altered states of consciousness .the important thing is to clean it , treat if for swelling and get the person to medical attention so it can be treated with some type of anti venom .i 'm captain joe bruni stay safe and we 'll see you next time .
like if his tail is tucked , then he 's afraid and you should not be petting him at that time and you should not be petting him at that time .you never pet a dog when he is afraid , because that will make him more afraid .if it is laying loosey like this , this is just normal .when he 's waging his tail. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's out here in the middle. [CLS] [SEP], that means he 's happy. [CLS] [SEP], that 's a normal state of mind .when the tail starts to go up and it starts to wag like this , your dog is probably in a more aggressive state of mind .another thing about dogs , when you 're walking them , you 'll see their ears perk up , if their ears perk up , that 's them paying more attention .but you can see a lot of times that they will get this intense stare when they are fixating on something and. [CLS] [SEP]when they are fixating on something , that 's when you need to correct them because that 's them being obsessed with that object whether it be a person , or another dog , or anything like that .so , it 's ok for dogs to look and be curious , but if they get that intense obssessive stare , then it 's going to be threatened .
and so i 'm going to be showing you a few ways to take your photos that you 've either taken all summer or have just made just specially for the holidays .the first one i 'm going to show you is how to make this adorable photo frame .and , i 'm just using a blank white card stock .i 've taken a picture of the boys and i 've just taken a color that matches of course , their clothes and punched it out .and , to do that , i just use my punch .i marked in an inch on each side. [CLS] [SEP]and then i know. [CLS] [SEP]i can just slide my punch in and punch out the frame .so , there 's your frame .and then all i need to do is attach it .i could add the a little bit of journaling with their names and the year , i could attach a ribbon , you could have all sorts of fun with these .here 's another way to take a chris , uh a photo. [CLS] [SEP]and this is some friends of mine. [CLS] [SEP]and they 've just placed the photo right on this card and using a little bit of ribbon , a stamp , an embellishment here. [CLS] [SEP]and then the name of the family there .so , it 's a quick and easy photo card that anyone would love to receive .and the last one is kind of like a photo ornament .inside my card i 've taken my photos. [CLS] [SEP]and i 've attached it to a ribbon .this can hang right up on the tree .using your photos to make christmas cards make a wonderful gift for everybody .everyone loves to see how your children are growing .i 'm janet casto , your independent demonstrator with stampin ' up .and , i hope you use this photo opportunity to the best of your knowledge .

this is rachel , with nutrolution , in miami beach , florida .in this clip , we 're talking about what are the different types of ginseng .so first , ginseng is a root , and there 's all different ways that you can prepare it .but it 's a root that grows in the ground , and people will use it .they 've use it throughout history ; making it as teas , grinding it up and adding it as a spice to things even , although it does n't taste so good .people even take the powder plain .and one of the things ginseng does is it actually really boosts your energy .so , it boosts your circulation , it boosts brain function .it gives a a kind of a powerful form of energy .now , there are different types of ginseng .there 's korean ginseng. [CLS] [SEP], there 's siberian ginseng , there 's panax ginseng , and different types of ginsengs impart different types of energy .the type of ginseng that i 've used in the past for myself and with my clients is called siberian ginseng , and this one is known as a tonic .and so , a tonic means that basically it 's something that can be used over a period of time , and it actually balances or tonifies the body .siberian ginseng actually works on the adrenal glands .it supports your energy health , so it does n't just rev you up like some of the other forms of ginseng do , or like caffeine would do .this is rachel , with nutrolution , in miami beach , florida .
as i said , and i did with the other figures before that it helps later when you put the coatings to have a better finish .the problem with the clay , water-based clay , is that when you work for long , it starts drying , you can see .and then these particles , they start adding on the wet clay that still you are working with and then they make like a little grain ; it 's a little pain .then this , it helps putting everything together and making the surface spark even , okay ?and also with some kind of a texture that -- it helps later with the appearance .i mean , it looks better when you paint it .and so , if you feel that there is some kind of bumps or some kind of edges that you do n't like ,you just smooth this down , right there , like this , and it looks much better .you can see now the face .you want --no .yeah .okay .we finished the shaping and we finished already the figurine and the texturing .okay .now , we are going to let it dry for almost four days .yes , four or five days .then after that , we 're going to use several kinds of coatings in order to protect the figurine .and then it 's going to be self-drying .it 's a self-drying clay. [CLS] [SEP]then you do n't need to put in the kiln. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to be hard enough if you do n't abuse that figurine .it 's going to stand here for a long , long , long time .
alright before you do any movement on the floor you have to engage your core .now doing this on the floor might take a little bit of a challenge .again focusing on the ribs , you want to put , sometimes i like to put my fingers right on the ribs. [CLS] [SEP], i address my class to sometimes put their hands by their sides or on the ribs .take a big breath in , inhale big , your ribs will expand out and on your exhale the ribs glue down .now the spine is what we 're focusing on , i 'm not really trying to round the spine into the floor , i 'm trying to bring the ribs in and lengthen the spine .depending on your body shape your spine may actually , you curve into the floor , but that 's not what we are looking for .we 're looking for a long spine , through the tail bone all the way through the center , all the way up into the crown of the head .stay engaged with a long spine .think of also , i like to give the analogy of the velcro on the inside of the ribs , inside of the front and inside of the back .squeezing them together and staying like that .that 's engaged .you might also feel like you 've got a boulder on your stomach , so you are long not scrunched with a boulder on your stomach , making a cave out of your stomach .think of also like having a really tight corset laced up so. [CLS] [SEP]if you 're long but you 're not rounding and the spine is on the floor from the tail bone all the way to the center .stay engaged for all of your movements before you move your arms or your legs .and that 's how you get engaged .
so i like to use the old fashioned peeler for this. [CLS] [SEP]and you can do it a different of couple of ways .you can go away from yourself like this or you can do it with a paring knife .i just like these old style because they have a nice pivot to them .i think i find the newer ones more bulky but whatever works for you is great .you can see the technique , you can do it either way .you can just turn it over and get the other side .okay , set that aside. [CLS] [SEP]and this is nice and washed .i like to do it like this .for a potato this size , i like to cut it length wise like this and again. [CLS] [SEP], you have two flat surfaces so less chance of you getting cut .so then you go ahead with this and cut those length wise. [CLS] [SEP]and you can push them up against each other to go ahead and make your cut .again , you want uniformity size of vegetables if possible .and just cut it like that. [CLS] [SEP]and you 've got some nice diced potatoes for your soup .
so our second exercise in the thigh , hip , butt blaster session is it 's a walking lunge. [CLS] [SEP]plus .so what you 're going to do we 're going to do a regular walking lunge. [CLS] [SEP]but we 're going to add a little bit something extra .we 're going to add a leg lift in the back to really lift that butt , tone and lift the butt. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 're going to add a knee lift in the front which also does more work for our legs for our legs in general , our quads and our hamstrings .so i 'll demonstrate how to do the walking lunge plus .start with your legs hip width apart , you 're going to just start doing a regular lunge. [CLS] [SEP]then you add a back leg lift , a front knee lift and then lunge .so , you want to watch out for divots in the ground .so basically you want to continue this cycle , go forward , go back , do as many as you can until you really start to feel the burn .so i 'll demonstrate a few more .and that 's a quick demonstration of how you can really work those hips , that butt and the thighs .
the fish that we are going identify now is the blackbar soldierfish .the blackbar soldierfish is a member of the squirrelfish family .most fishes in the squirrelfish family are reddish in color and have large eyes .the blackbar soldierfish is no exception to this .what makes the blackbar soldierfish distinctive is a single black bar found just behind its head making it look like a shoulder stripe on a soldier .they are also usually a bright red color and rarely a pale red unlike other squirrelfishes .they have large dark eyes which are necessary for them to see well at night when they are most active .during the day , most blackbar soldierfish can often be seen hanging out in cracks and crevices of the reef , in caves and in the shade under coral ledges .blackbar soldierfish are schooling fish , and usually found in small groups .they will watch divers cautiously but will quickly dart into a hole in the reef if they feel threatened .if you get close enough to a blackbar soldierfish , you will also note that the leading edge of most of their fins , have a thin white line of color .blackbar soldierfish are usually three to six inches in length .that 's the blackbar soldierfish .
well in essence , what we want to do is create one consistent response .if we can learn to do one thing really well , we get pretty good at it .in golf , all you need is one good swing .it works on your putting , your chipping , your pitching , and even your driver .in essence , your hands and the clubs start it back , your arms swing the club at your target .your hands and your clubs swing it back .your arms swing you ’ re the club at your target .on a full swing , the hands and club start it back and your arms swing the club at the target .consistency is gripping it the same , having good towards , aiming it the same , and making the same 2 good parts of the swing .the good back swing and a good forward swing .you control the distance by how far you take your hands and the club back and how fast you swing your arms on a forward swing .one controls the arch , the other one controls the club head speed .all you need is one consistent swing .does this sound simple ?well let me tell you something , it is simple .it ’ s called the kiss method .keep it simple stupid .why ?because the physical part of the game is not the hard part .golf is a brain game .you have to think the ball around the course .look at all the mini middle obstacles you have to overcome .imagine 50 people watching you tee off on the first tee .now , imagine tiger woods with about 2 ,000.imagine 2 ,000 people watching you put a 3 footer in the last hole to win the u.s. [CLS] [SEP]open .how about your 4 buddies hoping you miss it. [CLS] [SEP]so they. [CLS] [SEP]don ’ t lose all their money .that out of bounds to the right , that lake to left , those 4 bunkers ; they ’ re all mental obstacles .if you keep it simple , develop one really good response .i promise you , you can overcome those obstacles .
what we 're going to talk about is some common safety guidelines when it comes to legal consumer fireworks .one of those guidelines involves horseplay or boisterous conduct .at no time should horseplay or boisterous conduct be permitted by the users or by the person designated as the ignition person or the shooter .if this type of behavior takes place it should be put a stop to immediately .it would also serve to appoint somebody as a safety person to supervise the lighting of fireworks , that 's uninvolved with the actual ignition and use of these consumer legal fireworks .horseplay and boisterous conduct has resulted in many burn injuries and blast injuries over the years in the united states .i 'm captain joe bruni .stay safe , and we 'll see ya ' next time .
the next area i want to talk about is shadowboxing with an imaginary opponent .it 's important to have imagination , but in shadowboxing we 're going to use it .in some cases this could be the last guy you lost against .just keep that in mind when you 're shadowboxing .in other cases it could be the next guy you 're going to box against .you know , keep that in mind when you 're shadowboxing .but it 's very important to be able to other people can see on your face that there 's somebody in there you 're boxing with .it 's going to allow that much more room for excitement , that much more breaking up of your routine if you 're getting in there. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're shadowboxing with an imaginary opponent .chad , who are you going to box against today ?let 's see some imagination in there .the last person he lost to .it adds a whole new element when you can actually imagine someone you 're boxing against .we do work two boxers together , but fighting against an imaginary opponent is that much -- that much more better if you do n't have another opponent in there with you right now .the next clip we 're going to be working with another boxer , but right now chad is just fighting with an imaginary opponent .and again , just think of people -- the last person you lost against , the next person you 're going to fight .just get in there and have some fun .thanks .
if you have a bumpy or wrinkly surface than it is not going to stick properly .and also we are going to doctor the top. [CLS] [SEP]our t-shirt a little bit and give it more interesting hemline .we are going to iron our t-shirt on both sides , which is very important that you get both sides .
if you don ’ t hit the ball towards your target you may never get there , and you ’ re definitely not going to beat anybody .now , people here the word towards .what does towards mean ?well , to start out with , it means how you set up to the ball .if you don ’ t set up square to your target , you ’ re in trouble .so when you set up to a golf ball it ’ s very simple .your knees are flexed , your fanny ’ s out , and you ’ re built comfortably from the waist .you look like a linebacker , a short stop , a tennis player , a golfer : they ’ re. [CLS] [SEP]all the same .they ’ re a natural athletic position .let ’ s take towards and let ’ s put it into perspective .it ’ s not too difficult .you take the club , you put it behind the ball and you aim the club at your target .then you take your body and you square it to the club head .no signs to it .i ’ m. [CLS] [SEP]now square to my target .the ball is like on a railroad track .the ball is on one track going to the target and your body is on a parallel track square to your club head .how many times have we seen somebody do this ?then they setup to it. [CLS] [SEP]and hopefully they ’ re going to hit it where they ’ re aiming , which is dead right .so if i ’ m playing someone for money or a friendly wager , i ’ m definitely not going to show them how to line up properly because i ’ m going to make a lot of money off this mistake .this is the correct way right here .aim the club at your target , square your body to the club , and then as we ’ re going to talk about , you ’ re going to swing the club at your target which is always out in front of you .so remember , towards is a secret to golf .
that 'll work too .what you 're going to need is a minimum of six to eight people for this game. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's a great improvisation game .you also need strips of paper and some pens or pencils if you have .what you 're going to do is distribute the strips of paper to the group and they 're going to write lines - a sentence , either a line from a song or just a random sentence or line .anything they want .try to keep it clean , unless it 's a completely adult party and you can do what you want .but , write a couple of lines and you 're just going to fold them up , and place them in the hat , or bowl , or sock , or whatever .and then you 're going to carry on little improvisation scenes and throughout the scene , the players in the scene are going to pull from the hat and use those lines naturally within the improvisation scene or try to justify why they 've said whatever line is in the hat .so , we 're going to give you a short example of how this is played .david ?teri. [CLS] [SEP]: we just need a location please , to start our game .voice of camera : iowa .teri : iowa. [CLS] [SEP], okay .can we have a non-geographical location in iowa ?voice : a library .teri :okay , we 're in an iowa library .and whenever you feel the need , pull out a line and add it into the scene .teri : uh , sir i hate to tell you. [CLS] [SEP]but your books are three years overdue .david : man , that 's outrageous .well , you win some you loose some .teri : you sure do and in this case i really think you 're going to loose some .um , i think you 're library fine is twenty-seven thousand dollars .david : twenty-seven thousand dollars !i ca n't afford that .teri :well , you know , i just spoke with my boss this morning about company policy and one thing is said is `` you burnt my macaroni and cheese . [CLS] [SEP]''so we did n't get to talk too much about company policy because he really likes his macaroni and cheese .so , if i do n't get that twenty-seven thousand dollars i could be fired .david : listen , i 'm going to call my lawyer because he tells me that i 'm singing in the rain .teri :well , you 're going to be singing in jail pretty soon if you do n't come up with that money .david :yeah ,well he 's the best lawyer in town. [CLS] [SEP]and he says that pickled feet are his favorite food .teri. [CLS] [SEP]: you know what ! ?mine too !i should call your lawyer up and see if he wants to go to lunch some time .do you know what he might say to me ?he might say pimping ai n't easy. [CLS] [SEP]and i must say i 'll agree with him on that one .and that 's how you play lines from a hat .
drew noah :so now i 'm going to talk about how you can add friends using the -- kind of a more social networking aspects of the daily plate .so you 'll just want to go to your profile by clicking the profile link. [CLS] [SEP], there 's one right there ; i use one from a different place .but you can see you 've got your friends link right here. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm just going to click on that just give it a second to load .and to add a friend you need to -- so let 's go up here to my friends up here. [CLS] [SEP]and then here 's what the 'your friends ' section will look like .and to find members to add as friends you can do -- you can just meet people browsing the site looking on like the message boards or in the groups , you could make friends that way .or if you know somebody who is actually using the site have them give you their username. [CLS] [SEP]and then you can friend request them .so i 've got a made up user here that i 'm going to friend request .and you can see because the search was limited to `` with photos '' they did n't find the result 'cause there 's no photo there. [CLS] [SEP]yet. [CLS] [SEP]but if i just search again , here we go this. [CLS] [SEP]is the made up person i 'm friend requesting. [CLS] [SEP]so i would go to add as a friend .and there we go so now it says , `` you 're waiting to hear back from jane . [CLS] [SEP]''and then over here this is actually the profile. [CLS] [SEP]i just friend requested .go to the `` my friends '' link. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 've got a pending friend request right here. [CLS] [SEP]and this is me. [CLS] [SEP]so i will go ahead and accept it. [CLS] [SEP]and there we go .now there 's a friend and you can see they 're online. [CLS] [SEP]and this is jane looking at my profile and. [CLS] [SEP]she can see everything i 've got .and you can see when you add a friend you have the --this feed list of what they 've tracked .you can see , you know , now we 're friends , i 've tracked these things right here .so that 's how you add a friend and the other way of course. [CLS] [SEP], you know , you 're in the groups , you 're talking to people , and you could friend request any of these people. [CLS] [SEP]so that 's how you friend request somebody in the daily plate .
add it to the bowl .this was straight from the processor , so it 's the cacao nuts. [CLS] [SEP], there was a little bit of date , and we put some brazil nuts and walnuts in there .and now , this was just the water , so that we could get the material through the processor .we want to check what 's behind here .behind this cap is going to be some nut cream and some date and some chocolate .this is so beautiful .i want to make sure that we do n't miss out on this .oh it 's just so creamy .this is the best .it takes every bit of my self control not to eat this instead of having it go into the bowl .so i am having to be disciplined , so we 'll actually end up with something instead of half a recipe .this is the best ; it 's so creamy .this is the chocolate , plus the date , plus the nut butter .ok , put that in .and we 're also going to get behind this cap a little bit and find out what else we have back here .that 's more of it , and i do n't want to waste this .i want to make sure that we can use it .it 's a little bit tricky to get off of here , and usually i keep my hands very clean ,so i just use my fingers because it 's easier than this .i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]sorry. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]such a tease .
alright now we can tell that this is going to be the proper size ; even when we have our little handles on there , o.k .it 's going to be nice little nest. [CLS] [SEP]and when you 're handling this wet ware just be careful , alright .so , like that now our outline ; just go around with your needle tool , just give it a rough outline like that ; like that .carefully remove this trying to keep that shape. [CLS] [SEP]but we have the outline ; we can just go back and just form it again. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to take our scrape , and just get it around there. [CLS] [SEP]and then a little bit of slip that we saved from earlier ; and dab it down just dab on the slip , there .now we 're ready to attach this guy .
continuing with nia and putting it all together , we 're going to combine some martial arts movements with some leg movements .so we start out with some blocks .starting out in a stance , an open stance , comfortable , relax knees , hands right here , open hands .we have block up , block down , block up , step back , switch .block , block block , step back , switch .block , block block , step back , switch .block , block block , step back , switch .if you want you can have a little jump to that switch .step back , switch .or you could simply step back , switch .block , block block , step back , switch .precise , block , block block , step back , switch .block , block block , step back , switch .step back , switch .block , block block , step back , switch .so imagine you 're kind of sneaking up .sneaking up .so take your time , block , block block , step back , switch .block , block block , step back , switch .you want to add sound , you can go `` hop , hop hop , step back , switch .hop , hop hop , step back , switch .hop , hop hop .block with feet , legs .
another very important part of a weight management program is understanding energy sources .the body has 2 sources of the energy that it needs .it could either burn fat or it can burn sugar .naturally we 're all trying to burn fat because we 're all trying to streamline our bodies. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're trying to loose weight .but the problem there is that the body is programed to protect its fat source .so basically it has to deplete the glycogen which is the sugar storage in the blood before it will even begin to burn fat .this means that we have to normally in our exercise program we have to exercise for at least 20 to 25 minutes to be able to work through the glycogen in the blood. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's when we being to burn fat .there is a solution to this problem though. [CLS] [SEP], there is a product called the access bar , it 's made from a special kind of chocolate and what this product does is it tricks your body into thinking that the glycogen has been depleted .so the body will start burning fat immediately .the way this works is like this , you consume an access bar 15 minutes before activity on an empty stomach and your body will immediately start burning fat .there are several benefits to this ; one-you do n't get no lactic acid build up. [CLS] [SEP]which is what happens when the body is burning sugar .there is also no fatigue which also happens when the body is burning sugar .and the third benefit is no muscle soreness , which is one of greatest inhibited to the continuity in an exercise program because if you 're sore the next day you 're not like to get up and go at it again .the important thing is to be able to enjoy the exercise and utilizing the access bar and applying this whole concept of the energy system is what enables us to really be able to enjoy the activity. [CLS] [SEP]so we look forward to it , to the next day .
and you will have lovely lollipops .good .alright , put it on the top .so you can put it in to this lollipop maker and put the top on and put it in to the freezer until the next day .i am sure that we all want to raise our children as healthy as possible , so why not start it at the very early age when the accept everything from us to help them to accept a healthy life style .
now , let 's talk about some of the differences in spinning reels .now , spinning reels are probably the most versatile fishing tackle that really exists .you can use anywhere from a little mini cast to a little mini spinning like this , maybe two to four pound test line , use it for crappie fishing or , you know , your smaller stuff , makes a small fishing to a brawny fighter .lot of fun .generally use about a four and half , five foot rod .makes a nice balance .then you go into a normal flex rod which is this right here , this is a seven foot , with a 4 ,000 size stratic reel , ten , twelve pound test line .good for intermediate type fishing and shore fishing .and then , if you need heavier spinning gear , they have it where it 's suited to go up to 30 , 40 pound test line .this is a big pen spinning outfit that we actually catch 100 pound tarpon with .but , with the combination , you need a rod too. [CLS] [SEP]that can stand that kind of pressure as well .big range , they all work the same way .they cast the same way .they all have a bale the same way .most all of them have a front drag .it 's just that some are bigger , some are smaller and they 're used for different types of fishing .
in this clip i 'm going to talk about the age old question of whether you should write the words first , or the lyrics first , or do it at the same time .there is no answer to that question .everybody works differently. [CLS] [SEP]and i personally sometimes write the words first ,sometimes i write the melody first , sometimes mostly i write it at the same time .there 's advantages and disadvantages to both .if you write the words first you might want to read the words over to yourself and see what feeling comes up for you , what the feeling is like and then find the melody from that .if you just are walking down the street and this beautiful melody comes to you , you might say what feeling is this melody , what could this melody be expressing ?i kind of like to write a little bit of words , write a melody , and write at the same time .so there 's try it all three ways .try it every way .i mean you can even collaborate with someone and you can write the words and get a friend to write the melody or vise versa .the point is there 's no right or wrong way .do what you want , try all ways , and each has their advantage. [CLS] [SEP]i 've done both .so have fun and find your own style .
you want to make sure that you 're actually getting hydrated , if you have big games , if you have anything that you know that you 're going into , you want to say - make sure that you 're hydrating yourself during the week and especially the night before , and that means really staying away from alcohol , obviously , that means staying away from sodas , you really want to get as much water into your system if you know that there 's a point in the next day or so that you 're going to be perspiring , you know , at a rate that you should really hydrate yourself .once you get to that point and you have n't hydrated yourself you really put yourself in danger .you can pass out , there 's actually kidney failures .it 's a very dangerous thing not to hydrate yourself .so , really when you 're exercising at any level , you want to make sure that you 're carrying water with you or that there 's water available .and it does n't matter if it 's just an easy walk around your neighborhood , if it 's a full out marathon or if it 's playing football like steve does .you want to make sure that you 've always got water on hand .it can be the matter between life and death .
so , this one we 're going to do another waiting move .this is just stepping forward on your right foot and our left foot. [CLS] [SEP]is just going to be going back and forth over top of our right foot and to the side .so , it 's going to go forward step , back and forth , back , and then back into place .right foot , your left foot goes across the body , it goes back , and then it goes into place .you do a little hop to get your balance .your right foot follows , your right arms follows your right foot .right arm follows right foot and then when you go across your body it 's opposite .your left leg is going right and your arms are both going left .so , lets try that with the drum rhythm one time .that 's just one of our other waiting moves we can do during ras .
now , the equivalent of grain in film , is the noise in digital cameras .so , if you turn up the iso to 3200 , which is very high , it will take pictures at night , but it 'll also increase the amount of noise you have .with intelligent iso , it will change the iso , which is impossible on a film camera , but it will change in a digital camera and give you more noise , but better exposure and shutter speed levels .some other things that are important are in a prosumer model. [CLS] [SEP]is that you have a large lcd screen that 's got high resolution .so the lcd panel is what you 're going to use quite a bit .and i 've attached this accessory , which you could buy , that will block out the sunlight , because in direct sunlight , you wo n't be able to see the lcd panel .you 'll have to view through the viewfinder , but sometimes that 's inconvenient because you may want to view it from a distance and this will shade it .it 's sort of an auto shade .this has a true joystick and then it has the button joystick here. [CLS] [SEP]and this uses the lithium ion battery , which is basically proprietary to certain models of this particular company .this is the panasonic and it uses a leica lens .it uses sd , which is secure digital format , which is pretty much the universal. [CLS] [SEP], i mean , there 's about twelve of them , but this is the most universal .more cameras use this than any others .and , this will use the high capacity ones. [CLS] [SEP]so you could put a larger capacity one in here in order to take more pictures .when you 're using the raw format , you 're talking about thirteen megapixels to shoot a raw exposure , where it only takes two or three megapixels to shoot a jpeg .but , the raw exposure format has the ability to use a lot more different things as i 've just mentioned in a previous one .
in this clip we 'll be talking about crescent kicks .the first crescent kick is an outside inside crescent kick which looks like .in order to do an outside inside crescent kick , when you first pick up your foot you ?re picking up like a front kick chamber .with you knee pointed slightly off to the side of your target at eleven o'clock .as you kick you bring it across to two o'clock , re-chamber , and set it down .when you do your kick you want to make sure that you hit your target with the top of your foot and to generate power. [CLS] [SEP]you whip your hips as you come through the kick .the next crescent kick is an outside to inside crescent kick which looks like .in order to do an outside to inside crescent kick you pick up your back leg , like a back leg front kick , and you want to make sure that you hit the target with the inside of your foot .you kick out to eleven o'clock , come all the way across , making our two o'clock , re-chambering , and setting it down .one more time ; you pick it up , kick across , and set it down .to generate power out of it as you pick it up. [CLS] [SEP]you whip. [CLS] [SEP]your hips across into a front kick chamber and then back down .an advance form of the outside inside crescent kick is the tornado kick which looks like .an easier way to do a tornado kick is to start off with the back leg round kick .you do a back leg round kick , set your foot down , pre-pivot , look over your shoulder , pick up your back leg like a front kick chamber , kick across , and set it down .one more time ; start with a back leg round kick , pre-pivot , set down your foot , pick up your left leg , coming across , seeing your target , and kicking through .that is your crescent kicks .
and i ’ m going to pull the mattresses out as well. [CLS] [SEP], the foam pads out , lay those out and let those air out a little bit too .once they ’ ve aired out for a little bit , then you want to roll them up .with the rectangular bag you often roll it up instead of stuffing it , so i ’ m just going to fold in half .this one happens to have a nice strap on the end that i can use to pull the bag to cinch it together when it ’ s rolled up .i ’ m going to put it down on the ground and just take and roll from one end trying to keep a fairly neat tight roll .you can use your knee to compress it a little bit if you want , once i get to the end. [CLS] [SEP]i ’ m going to put that strap around it. [CLS] [SEP]and you have a nice compact sleeping bag .a lot of other sleeping bags you stuff in a stuff sack. [CLS] [SEP]and this is a compression stuff sack. [CLS] [SEP]so this is one that ’ s actually going to allow me to make it even smaller once i ’ ve stuffed the bag in it .when i ’ m stuffing a sleeping i like to start at the head end , just start putting it in the bag and. [CLS] [SEP]it doesn ’ t have to go in any kind of special pattern or order. [CLS] [SEP], you just kind of stuff it in there .this is best for some insulation that don ’ t like to be rolled up and actually you retain their loft better by doing this .once it ’ s stuffed all the way in the bag. [CLS] [SEP]i ’ m going to compress the bag , tighten up the closure and use the straps on the side to make the bag smaller and again it ’ s. [CLS] [SEP]like i ’ m hike backpacking or canoe camping and size is at a premium , this is a great way to end up with a really tight package and there ’ s my sleeping bag .
today i am going to show you how to make to different area rugs made from recycled blue jeans .turn your old favorite jeans into something new !jeans can also be found in second hand or thrift stores very inexpensively .i will show you how to make this braided rug .it requires no machine sewing .i 'll show you how to that you can sew it by hand or. [CLS] [SEP]i 'll even show you a method that requires no needle and thread .i 'll also show you this shaggy rug that requires simple sewing machine sewing .these are the materials we 'll be using to make our braided recycled jeans rugs .you will need about 4 or 5 pairs of old blue jeans .you 'll need a good strong pair of scissors .i 'm going to show you two methods of putting the rug together .one that you will need a nice strong twine .i 'm using a natural hemp twine that 's very strong .or some carpet thread and a needle .you want to make sure the needle has a big enough hole for the carpet thread .and the needle is sharp enough and goes through the heavy fabric of denim easily .so you might want to try a few different needles to see which one is best .you might need a small pair of snips .if you are going to put the rug together with the twine instead of sewing it together , then you will need a popsicle stick .and then it 's good to have a safety pin for holding it in place while you cut new strips .
here you can see the diamond and this is the rough diamond .here is the marking .the second step is the cutting of the rock .here you can see that this rock has been converted into this shape after cutting and then the shape is given to the diamond .like here you can see the shape is a bit wavy. [CLS] [SEP]but here it is called the proper round circle and the proper shape .then comes the facets .the facets have been made and here you can see all the facets from the top view and the side view .after we give the facets and the different features of the diamond has been enhanced .then the diamonds have been polished and you will see here that the diamonds have been polished .so this is the process when the diamonds have been polished .
this discussion is on excess f.i.c.a. [CLS] [SEP], commonly known as fica .this is an easy one to overlook now , now that the limit is up about $ 97 ,500.00 .remember that if you work for more than one employer and the total withholding you have paid in exceeds the limit for which social security can be taken out .the difference is refunded to you or credited against any other taxes you might owe .so , take a good look at that and make sure you add them up .an income of a hundred thousand is going to yield an overpayment , so take a close look at that , and i thank you for looking at this tape .i 'm tom choisnet , enrolled agent , and there are a number of other clips that might interest you .thank you !
it 's going to sop up a lot of this flavor .then we want to go ahead and grab a laddel see how nice and thick that has become again. [CLS] [SEP]we cook this for about an hour and a half .you want to test the beef once in a while. [CLS] [SEP]let 's see how tender it is i already have done that. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's just perfect. [CLS] [SEP]so make sure you get all the olives in there and some meat , all the bell peppers , just beautiful .go ahead and just top that this is a good size portion for me. [CLS] [SEP]and then just to finish it up. [CLS] [SEP]garnish it with some green peppers , green onions just like that .you put a few around the edge of plate for a little color and beauty and there you go , grillades with spanish creole sauce bone a petite .
now we 're going to show you how to stop a breakaway or approach a breakaway .the first thing is that when a breakaway is coming at you , you want to make sure that you skate out .depending on where the breakaway is happening or how far away it is away from you , you want to come out to no further than the hash marks .kind of use that energy and momentum to skate yourself backward as the shot is coming , but you do n't want to come out too far , because if you do , the player can come around and score in empty net .now we 're going to have a breakaway coming down .now as you can see , that momentum that you use to bring yourself back helps you prepare for a save .and that 's how to stop a basic breakaway .
if you are like me you wind up eating , sometimes at restaurants that are not fancy enough to have cloth napkins so they have paper napkins .so you bring along your zig markers and you pull them out. [CLS] [SEP]and you ask for an extra paper napkin. [CLS] [SEP]and you get them. [CLS] [SEP]and then you put a fun design on. [CLS] [SEP], the trick is to get it done by the time your food gets served .and then you leave it behind. [CLS] [SEP]ok , so like johnny appleseed , spreading the word that , yes there is such a thing as western calligraphy .but what i really want to talk about. [CLS] [SEP]is just the whole idea of surfaces .different kinds of surfaces on which you can put your letters. [CLS] [SEP]so guess what , there 's practically anything that you can imagine you can put lettering on .
these are coming together nicely just keep stirring it. [CLS] [SEP]and as you are stirring it you are also mixing the vegetables over saute the peppers , red pepper , garlic , capers , and olives together .okay you want to keep turning it sauteing , keep turning it. [CLS] [SEP], it really helps break up the chop meats that so it is not in little clumps. [CLS] [SEP]and you do n't want that barbecue the little clumps. [CLS] [SEP]are not going to be absorbing over flavor to the other ingredients that you have when it comes to chop meat .so that is what we are doing .it is starting to come together nice. [CLS] [SEP]we are going to saute this throughly and cook the meat. [CLS] [SEP]and it is almost there .i 'm going to lower it just a little bit and keep stirring it keeps breaking up the chop meat .you see how nice the chop meat is breaking up so it is in little shredded pieces and not crumbs .
now most of the problems that we have with gates is that over a period of time they start to sag and you wo n't be able to open them because they 'll start dragging on the ground .so if you have this situation the best way to fix this , is you 'll see on the back side. [CLS] [SEP]what we 've done is we put an anti sag device in here .and what this is made up of is , has two metal brackets , one on the bottom corner here. [CLS] [SEP]and then one on this top inside corner. [CLS] [SEP]and it has a cable and with a turn buckle feature here .what this turn buckle allows us to do , these two connectors are threaded in opposite directions so whenever we have a sag to the gate i can lift up on the outside of the gate. [CLS] [SEP]and then i can rotate this turn buckle to put more tension on the tightness .so as we tighten it , it 'll actually lift up the outside of the gate and allow it to swing more freely .and if you have a gate that does not have this anti sag device on , again it 's a very easy installation process .these anti sag devices are something you pick up at just about any hardware store or home improvement store .and again , you simply attach the brackets on the top , the top side which would be your hinge side of the gate to the lower side of your framing on the outside of your gate and you 'll connect it , this cable with these locking devices. [CLS] [SEP]and then you just tighten your turn buckle .and in most cases that 'll take care of any of the you know , the majority of the problems that you have with your gate .so i 'm tim gipson and that 's how to fix and outdoor gate .
so , you want to make small talk .a few guidelines , no religion , no politics , and ask questions .you 've gone to a , art museum and kind of a function afterwards .it 's going to be a situation where you 're going to have hors d oeuvres , you 're going to have some wine , and you 're going to talk to other people .how do you happen to know the hostess ?you 've got an open end question .small talk , one never knows where the small talk will go .woman to woman , where did you get the shoes ?man to man , have you picked up the tickets for the rays game ?whatever it might be , small talk , then focus on what the other finds interesting , and what you have in common .it 's an easy way to expand into more small talk , and who knows , maybe even a friendship .so again , there are no small topics , only small people .but you 're a bigger person , so involve yourself with small talk , and enjoy your life .this is dr. [CLS] [SEP]paul , may your fantasies of today , be your realities of tomorrow .
so if we take a look at the shifting and what is actually going on on the bicycle , once you have got it in your stand here and you are running through the bike you can notice if it is moving too far up or too low once you have got it spinning there .the way you do that is you address it here and your barrel adjuster .so if i need more tension. [CLS] [SEP]i turn it in towards the wheel to increase the tension. [CLS] [SEP]and if i need it less i can bring it back down and allow it to drop down the cassette a little bit easier .the same with the crank , if you are having troubles with the chain going into the big ring you need more tension in your front d ?railleur there. [CLS] [SEP]and you would address it in your barrel adjuster whether it be increasing tension to get it to shift easier into the big ring or decreasing tension to get it to drop from the big ring to the small ring .little things like that with the bike being in storage or not ridden in a while in the winter your cables will stretch and they will need a little bit of adjustment. [CLS] [SEP]so take some time and fine tune your cables and make sure that they are correct .
so we 're going to ask faith to start out in tadasana , lengthening up , rooting down through her feet and reaching through the crown of her head .she 's going to inhale and reach her arms up to the sky .lifting out of her waist , she 's lengthen up. [CLS] [SEP]and as she exhales , fold forward .now , she may not be able to come down all the way and her spine maybe rounded and that 's where these blocks which you can put at all different levels come in handy .so we 're going to place these blocks right under faith 's hands. [CLS] [SEP]and then she is able to lengthen out her spine .she 's going to take one leg up , which ever you prefer .it does n't really matter .and she 's going to extend it up as far as she can .now , it does not have to come up very high , just as high as she can .your hip can be open or close .but when you 're in this posture , using the blocks allows you to come into the full posture even though you might have a tight back and tight hamstrings 'cause it takes -- it brings the ground up higher. [CLS] [SEP]so you just do n't have to go down as far .and therefore , she 's able to get all the benefits of this pose which is reversing the flow of gravity , flushing new blood into her heart and lymph node system which is really good for your immune system .she 's going to relax her head down and just breathe .good .this is also going to work her glute muscles , give her standing strength and balance through her leg muscles and work her balance .
hi , my name is teri and in this segment , we 're going to talk about how to minimize your pores .now it 's important to realize why some parts of our face have larger pores on them than others .now sometimes it 's hereditary , sometimes if we had excess acne when we were younger , that can cause larger pores in certain areas .but often , for most of us , it 's because we have extra dirt or oil in those areas and that 's where it tends to collect , usually in around the nose area , or the forehead , and sometimes the jaw line and chin area .that 's where you 're going to see the larger pores .there 's literally hundreds , if not thousands of products on the market that will help with pore minimizing .now some of them range from very inexpensive to quite expensive .i 'm going to go over a couple of options with you .now of course , this is a standard thing you should be using every day .it 's a toner .now you can get it with alcohol , or alcohol-free .if you have quite dry skin , stay away from an alcohol based product , use an alcohol-free toner .then we also have the pore minimizing daily facial wash , and that comes in a lot of different brands and products .usually that has some sort of scrub in it and that just cleans out those pores to try to get them to shrink down , get the oil and dirt out .we also have pore strips , minimizing strips .those come with a lot of different brands carry those .they usually fit around your nose or forehead area .when you peel them off , it takes the dirt that 's been in those pores .pulls 'em right out .and then , you could also invest in a cheap , or expensive if you choose , micro-dermabrasion kit at home .those are all the rage these days and they really do work .use them once a week , and you will see a result within four to six weeks of minimizing of your pores .now , if you want to use a product , just straight from the kitchen , do n't want to spend any money , egg whites .you whip up your egg whites from an egg , just put it on your face like a mask .let it sit and dry , wash it off .you do that once a week , you should notice an improvement in your pores as well .
in this step we will be assembling the sides to the front and back of the bird house .first , we caulk the side .be sure to , sure you only draw the heads down flush with the side panels .you will caulk the back side the same way you did , both sides are caulked the same way .all you need is a very little bit of caulk .be sure you caulk across the bottom .now , when you attach these sides , be sure that the , you 're flush with the bottom when you do this .we 're going to put four screws in this side .that is how you assemble the two sides to the bird house .
our lesson is drawing ; more specifically , drawing cars .even more specifically , we are going to detail them .do n't get out your wash bucket or anything .we are not going to get our hands wet .we are going to bring out the details of the car like going back into our drawing .we are going to start by defining these wheels more .we just had drawn shapes here .so you might have to break out a ruler if you want it to be a design that might call for that. [CLS] [SEP]but i am going to go for a simple star shape. [CLS] [SEP]but really i think i should be able to do just by hand ; simple five pointed star .no longer do we have a child like scribble but hopefully a more refined and accurate drawing of the sport 's hatch .i 'll go back to the rear lenses or tail lamp .i 'll give them some sort of idea of what is going on ; some lines to define that they are actually a lens .i 'll come up to the door handle. [CLS] [SEP]and i am going to refine that more because it was pretty rough before .i 'll do the same with the mirror .i 'll add some details to the hood ; like a windshield wiper and being aware of the view of that is quite different than the way you normally see a windshield wiper ; just a little bit of a line , my front turn signal , maybe some body lines , darken up things , my wheel wells or fenders , give them a more refined , defined look , a few more details and there you have it .that 's detailing a car for you .it 's not enough to get our hands wet .
in doing so , you 've got to stimulate that muscle for maximum growth to give you a good muscular developed base .but once you get that good muscular developed base , you have to reduce the body fat levels in order to be able to see the fruits of your labor .so , muscle building exercises such as a bicep curl , by utilizing dumbbells or barbell , to strengthen and tone the muscles will get you a good start , but in order to see the results of that , you 've got to reduce that overall body fat level to develop that nice , toned look .in doing so , you 've got to modify your diet to reduce the calories you 're taking in or take in more quality , higher quality foods .but also increase your energy expenditure by being more active overall in your daily lifestyle .not just when you 're spending time exercising , while you 're on the treadmill or out for a jog , but also the time that you spend away from the gym. [CLS] [SEP]-- that 's around the house , at your work , wherever you may be -- to have an overall active lifestyle the rest of your life .it 's not just achieve those bigger goals and then stop , it 's a lifelong process that requires a lot of time , a lot of effort , a lot of energy , and a lot of patience to see results .
and it 's an easy way to add style to your house plant .there are a lot of planters that you can select from ; they all can add style to your house .this ceramic container right here i love it because it just has a lot of style to it , it 's very simple too .i think style should be simple. [CLS] [SEP]it should n't be to obnoxious. [CLS] [SEP]and it has a great color. [CLS] [SEP]and i got a great texture .anything that appeals to the eye and the touch is going to add style to the garden .anything that appeals to you by colors , texture or touch , it 's going to make a great house plant container .there are a lot of containers that are not really specific designed for house plants that you can use for a house plant .for example i find that vases many times make incredible planters and this is just a gorgeous pink vase .to put a plant in there i would just take these plants out , add a bunch of gravel on the bottom and just set a plant right inside .it will cascade over and make a beautiful container .for example i find that vases many times make incredible planters and this is just a gorgeous pink vase .to put a plant in there i would just take these plants out , add a bunch of gravel on the bottom and just set a plant right inside .it will cascade over and make a beautiful container and just by adding some beads. [CLS] [SEP]it just makes the container a little more interesting .in the next segment we 'll talk about how to add a little glitter to your house plants .
in this clip i 'm going to discuss the usage of stick wrap , why we use it. [CLS] [SEP]and actually how to wrap a stick .the reason that you want to use stick wrap. [CLS] [SEP], it 's just like a baseball player .you do n't want that stick to slip out of your hand while you 're playing .so there 's several different kind of stick wraps on the market .if you 're a cheapskate like i am , you can actually use tennis racket wrap which i use quite often .but here we have an actual drum stick company that we bought here .they usually come with this plastic protection on it .and they also have these little sticky deals on the end here .so you want to first remove that .you want to start at the butt end of the stick .you stick that on there , and then you slowly roll the stick and pull on the actual wrap itself .and once you get started there 's actually a little groove. [CLS] [SEP], you 'll see as you get it going how it just lines itself up .and i 'm keeping the whole time either this hand or this hand. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm keeping a grip on it. [CLS] [SEP]so the stick wrap does n't unravel on me .and you slowly make your way down the stick , spinning it and gripping it as you go .and you can see the grooves , if you can see how evenly spaced those are .that makes it nice .you do n't want to try to go up on it like this and overlap what you 've already put on there .so let me back up here a little bit .okay ?and then just continue going down the length of the stick .and now you can also , this is actually going down farther on the stick than i would go .because i do a lot of rim shot stuff , and when you 're doing rim shot stuff it will tend to chew the tape up and the grip .and then the grip will actually unravel .so what you could do , you could stop short like i would probably stop about here .i would take some scissors and cut that off .but we 'll just show you here just to get this done for us .and there 's actually another tab here .and then that actually goes like that .then they actually provide you with more tape to make sure that sucker does n't come off while you 're jamming .that wraps on there like that .and these are also reusable .you can , if you do n't rim shot them up too bad where you mess them up , you can unravel this and put it on a new stick when you 're done .but like i said , it 's cool for grip , looks cool and when you throw them out in the crowd after a show the kids get a cool stick with stick wrap on it .and that 's how you wrap a stick .
what attracts fleas ?well , fleas are a animal that are completely and totally motivated by their stomach .so what attracts the flea ?well , food sources attract the flea .and what means food to a flea ?warmth and heat are going to indicate food , or some sort of food source passing by the flea .movement is going to indicate that , the vibrations on the ground , somebody walking. [CLS] [SEP], somebody talking , any kind of vibration or movement is going to indicate a flea that there 's a potential prey about .and then also carbon dioxide oddly enough. [CLS] [SEP], they can detect carbon dioxide .and they will - they 're attracted to basically breathing animals , and then of course lastly blood .if there 's any source of open blood that 's going to help attract them as well .so what they 're going to do is they use all of these attractants. [CLS] [SEP]and they 're going to use those to define what is a prey item that they can get on. [CLS] [SEP]and they can prey and use to feed off of and lay their eggs on .so they 're going to find -they 're going to take that warmth , that movement , that carbon dioxide and if there 's any blood smell , they put it all together and to them , that says lunch .and that could be you .
in this step i want to talk to you and sheena obviously , how to and how to select your concealer .now in your example , you said your skin tends to be a little drier at the moment with a little bit of redness and small blemish here and there .i really think that you personally would benefit from a concealer that has a nice cream consistency but , but also stay put .it is very important that the concealer really conceals because that 's what it 's supposed to do .and you also do n't want it to blend off or smudge off after , just a few minutes .since you 're spending money on a product , it should really work .there , a good trick is , if the concealer really covers up , is to , if you are in the store and you have the chance to test your product , is to check on the back of your hand and try to cover up , you know , any blue veins that you see there , usually a little more visible on fair-skin people .so let 's see , i would probably go with something a little yellow base , i 'm kind of in between there .so maybe the first two shades , lighter too like a medium light .and then if you manage to kind of cover up the vein , that 's usually your shade .your concealer should always be slightly lighter than your foundation .
hi , i 'm lucy spain here to show you how to do splits in cheerleading .cheerleading splits are a commonly used pose to do when you 're doing a cheerleading formation .you can also use these splits in your stunts as well , once the fliers have gotten good at them .it 's important to make sure you stretch out when doing a cheerleading split .we 're going to concentrate on the left and right splits .this is going to be a right split with your right leg out forward .first we want to start out with our right leg forward .we 're going to stretch forward .make sure your knee is at a ninety-degree angle .we do n't want our knee to go past our toe .so we 're going to stretch forward into it .after you do this stretch for about fifteen seconds , you want to lean back and stretch the underneath of the leg .stay back in this stretch for about fifteen minutes .you can lean your chest forward on this one as well .after that , you can simply slide into your split .a common pose you can use is the high v once you 're in your split .that 's the right split .the left split is going to be the exact same thing to the other side .ninety degree angle .make sure we get a nice stretch on the inside of your thigh , lean back and stretch the underneath of our leg , and we 're going to slide into our left split and hit our high v. [CLS] [SEP]the last split is going to be a middle split .that 's going to be when you 're facing forward .this is the most difficult and will take the most prep to get into .you can stretch for this one by simply going down over both legs .you can do a squat stretch and then into your middle split .and that is how you do a cheerleading split .
our next advanced technique , in continuation with ushiro waza techniques from behind , is called ryote kubi dori dai sankyo. [CLS] [SEP]and it looks like this .as he is coming around to try to grab both of my arms , as he comes in. [CLS] [SEP]i step to the side , controlling his arm , applying sankyo , stepping in from behind , and bringing him down , and finishing with ombori .in real time is should look like this .
either we are just going to freshen it needs just a little bit of wrinkles taking out that has been cause by hanging out in the closet being pushed up to other clothes .we are going to go for the pleat in front the seam. [CLS] [SEP]and then we are going to freshen right around the pockets and around the back and on the side seams there just to stretch them out again. [CLS] [SEP]and then we would go under here on the side and get this area .i know you are wonder well. [CLS] [SEP]are n't i making another crease up there were the fold. [CLS] [SEP]is. [CLS] [SEP]well i try not to. [CLS] [SEP]but if i where to have i would just change the position of the pant .make sure that it is nice and stretched out. [CLS] [SEP]and then i will hit that area and try to stay away from the top. [CLS] [SEP]but it is one way to hit the areas that you have missed .okay nice and fresh. [CLS] [SEP]you are ready to put these on and go somewhere. [CLS] [SEP]look fresh .in our next segment you would be seeing me to done more garment a completely different material and a completely different thing to be ironing the part would be mysteries to you. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm sure .
any time you do an acupressure session you 'll always want to close it carefully .you do n't want to grab the dog go running and play ball with them .you do n't want to run out and feed them their dinner .you want to spend a few minutes of quiet time as you end the massage .you can sit and pet them , talk to them or just sit quietly with them and let them relax a little bit , let them actually absorb the energy that you 've moved around the body and feel better and give them a few minutes to relax too and that way they will get the most benefit from the session .if they jump up immediately the muscles start tightening , the back starts tightening and you 'll undo what you 've done so always spend a few minutes of just quiet time .you can do it toward the end of the day or at a point when the dog is going to have some rest , that 's best so that then they are in quiet time. [CLS] [SEP]and they actually relax , give the muscles time .for those of you who have had a massage you know that that is one of the important things is to lie quietly after your massage and let the energy that has been worked on your bones and muscles actually be absorbed , let your body enjoy that , and then get up and move around but only move around slowly .
i 'm using black beans .i love beans , these beans .i love black beans .i love to eat them .so , i 'm going to use them in the shaker .and , an actual shaker .it 's small in cylinder and not too long .i took this from my granddaughter .this was something that her candy came in .i just stripped off the label .and , it actually have tabs on the end to secure the beans in there .so , we 're going to take this and create a small shaker .
we 're learning how to cornrow and adding extensions into these cornrows .okay so down here as you see we 've created this one braid .so what to do now ?you could keep going on and braiding but ashley actually wants a pony tail at the end , when it 's all said and done , she 'd like a pony tail , and so we 're going to give her that first section .so basically all the rest of the braids are going to have this extra hair hanging out. [CLS] [SEP]and she 's going to be able to put it all back in a pony tail and do fun things with it .so here we go .you just put the pony around the hair section right there .so after you 've done that you 're going to want to take out the rubber band in the next section and loosen that .at this point if you need to and you have , see look what i just did , i just barely broke that rubber band , if you have a rubber band that 's being a little bit too stubborn just break it .just make sure you do n't hurt your client .alright so get that section ready for that next braid .
and we are going to sew on the wrong side of the fabric .so we get them matched up nice and straight , take them to our machine. [CLS] [SEP], we are going to use a quarter inch seam allowance , which also happens to be the width of the presser foot , and we 're going to go ahead and sew these together .as you 're stitching these you 're going to want to make sure they are lined up nice and even on the edge .and we are going to repeat this on the second strip also .so we end up with two strips sewn together like such .i 'm going to show you how to iron the strips once we 've sewn them .you 're going to open the fabric face down or right side down on the ironing board. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to press the seam allowance to the dark fabric .so from the front side it does n't show through on the lighter fabric .once you 've done the back side just go ahead and flip it to the front and make sure it looks nice and even .
it 's a nice effect in some of his work with aerosmith .and , again an effect that 's complimentary for both rhythm and lead , clean or distorted tones .so , and what the vibe effect is or univibe is something like the pedal is called .it 's simply this .kind of creates what they use to call tremolo or vibrato .like some of the old fender amps that used to come stocked in those amps back in the day like sixties and seventies .so , in this example what i 'm going to simply use is just for like a chordal type thing you might use in a verse pre-chorus or chorus in a song .and , it 's just simply going .now , without the effect .and , so with the effect what it does is just gives it again another dimension .and , i 've heard this effect also in like bands like sound garden and some other bands where they just use it just again to kind of take you somewhere else in a song .so , again just using that simple picking pattern using an a major chord .and , you know what you have is a nice vibe sounding effect used in the context of a rhythm .
i say great .write the story .forget about everything else , and put all of your passion , and everything you have , into creating that story , because when you do , you will create the best story you possibly can , and it has nothing to do with money , and it has nothing to do with wealth and fame , and fortune .i think the best pay , i 'm going to say the best thing that happened to me , when i was writing , is i 'd written a children 's book ,that i called charlie 's treasures , and it really is an inspired work .it 's about a young boy , who shares his most valued treasures , which is this bag of marbles , which are really a metaphor , for people that we meet in our lives , and we debuted it at the la times festival of books , which from a financial standpoint , was horribly unsuccessful .i did n't sell enough books to pay for the booth , not even pay for my gas .probably not even paid for the parking , and the food , but i had a man at the end of the book festival , stand at my booth , and read the book cover to cover , and he looked up at me with a tear in his eye , and. [CLS] [SEP]he said , '' thank you for writing this story . [CLS] [SEP]''that 's why i write .if someone reads your work , and is that moved , then you 've succeeded in a way that every writer dreams of succeeding , and that is to have somebody appreciate , and be touched by the words that you write .
now i am ready to make the lid with the beads and the sequences and get it ready to be attached to the kaleidoscope .the first thing i want to do before i start decorating the lid is to make a hole in the middle and that same hole is going to be where it sits on the kaleidoscope on our wooden stick that is already attached to it .so i can take any sharp object .i just happened to take another skewer that the sharp end can make a nice hole right into the middle of the lid .and now i am going to put glue around the lid. [CLS] [SEP]and i will put it in different spots , different areas because i want the beads and the sequences to be very spread out onto the lid .so i do not have to cover the whole thing with glue , but i just put it into spots where i want the beads to stick .now i can go ahead and take my beads and sequences and just sprinkle them around the top of the lid. [CLS] [SEP]and we put it over the drops of glue that we put on .and we see that it sticks nicely. [CLS] [SEP], it just sits right in place .they are very small. [CLS] [SEP]so they kind of sink right into the glue .i find that the rubber cement glue works best for this .it is strong glue and it also dries quickly. [CLS] [SEP]so i do n't have to wait too long .it does not hold me up when i am doing my project .so i sprinkle it around in any spots of glue that i have left or any places that i feel that are empty spaces. [CLS] [SEP]and i want to put more beads or sequences. [CLS] [SEP]i just go ahead and drop them onto those spaces .if i need to put more glue i can also add some more drops of glue .the varied of the colors and sizes is going to be what creates the different form , the formations inside the kaleidoscope. [CLS] [SEP]so it is important to really try and vary as much as you can the colors and the different sizes of the beads or the sequences .now you do not have to feel like you have to cover the entire lid .even though the beads and the sequences are spaced out it is still going to create the different types of shapes inside the kaleidoscope because everything is being reflected from three sides .so you do not have to cover the entire thing .in fact , it is probably better that you have space in between because it creates more room for the formations to take effect .so now i have shown you how to take the lid , cover it with glue , and put some beads and sequences on it and get it ready for attaching to our kaleidoscope .
my favorite august costume. [CLS] [SEP]i have many but. [CLS] [SEP]my favorite is red .so i like a little red on the lips just enough to set it off and perhaps a little red up here on your outlines .to set that off .there we go .you notice that some people you teach that you change hands , you do your right side with your right hand and your left side with your left hand .me personally. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]very right handed. [CLS] [SEP]so i do it all with my right hand .but i wanted to show you that it is possible to switch hands like that .of course i would like to outline my mouth. [CLS] [SEP]set it off .there you go .
what i 'm going to discuss and talk about , is how to basically assess a persons vitals signs without using any technical instruments .like a blood pressure cuff and stethoscope or things along those lines .the first thing that we want to assess is their level of consciousness through the pupils .ask them do they know where they are , do they know their name and to see if they are alert and oriented .we can also take a light , shine it in the persons eyes to see if the pupils are equal and reactive .and if they are symmetrical and of the same size .level of consciousness .the next thing we want to determine is pulse rate .we can gain the pulse rate or gage the pulse rate by feeling the radial pulse in the wrist or the carotid pulse up in the neck line .count the beats for fifteen seconds .multiply it by four for our heart rate .we would then move on to respiratory rate and count the respiratory rate watching rising chest fall .or stomach rise and fall for fifteen seconds .multiplying by four .checking skin condition by examining whether they are pink and flushed , or pale and sweaty , or cool and clammy .which would be a poor indicator .and finally checking capillary refill or circulation by taking a pen or some type of hard object like our fingernail .pressing down on the nail bed and watching the white spot turn back to pink .in the time it takes to say the words capillary refill that nail bed should have flushed back pink again .all a good vital sign .basic steps in determining vital signs without using any type of instruments or measuring equipment .i 'm captain joe bruni .stay safe .and we 'll see you next time .
the most common play in virtually all forms of solitaire is moving a card or cards from the tableau to the foundation .in fan , the way that starts is , when you have an ace that you can play , and right now i have eighteen playable cards in front of me .i have the top card of each fan , this , this is the top , the card that does n't have any cards over it , that 's the top card of each fan .and then i 've got the free card , the lone card .right now , to move a card to the foundation , it has to be an ace .foundations are built up , ace , two , three , four and so on .so , i 'm looking for , for aces to move down to the foundation .here 's another one .and these two aces are not in play right now because this eight is blocking it .but i can build on my ace of diamonds and ace of hearts .ace of hearts , here 's the two of hearts that 's in play , two of diamonds ,sorry , there 's the three of diamonds , there 's the two of hearts and so on .
so , in the next segment we 're going to do the sail finish out and hardware on this omega. [CLS] [SEP]fourteen gin .in the tack and head we 're going to use number three spur grommets .the key to a spur grommet is the teeth in the grommet .so , if you can see those teeth on the grommet , they really bite into the fabric .then in the clew we 're going to use 20mm hydraulic press ring .this also has big teeth .this is a stainless steel grommet and has a working load of , you know , of hundreds or a thousand pounds .you really need a big grommet in the clew .if you do n't have the facilities or the dies to install a ring like this you can do a stainless steel round ring and use webbing straps and sew those onto the clew .that can get you through in a pinch .i 'm going to go ahead and take a pencil. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to put the grommet where i want it on the corner and draw the inside of the ring. [CLS] [SEP]so i know exactly where to punch the hole .i want the edge of the ring to be an eighth of an inch away from the edge of the sail cloth .i 'll hold it there .so , there 's our clew position .i 'll go ahead and with the number three. [CLS] [SEP]spur grommet mark the head and tack .so , again i 'm putting the edge of the ring about an eighth of an inch away from the edge of the sail .we 're doing the same thing in the tack .i 'm going to take a hole punch for the number three spur grommet and a mallet and punch the hole and install the grommet .make sure to give good taps .start out when tapping spur grommets with a light tap. [CLS] [SEP]and then , then hit it really hard the next few taps .the important part is to start the forming process of the metal properly .a few good hits. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's set solid .so , now we 're going to press in the clew ring .this is a twenty ton hydraulic press .it takes about eighteen tons of pressure to form this stainless ring .the stainless steel ring and the tooth washer , and a very special dye that forms it .if you 're making your own sails you may want to take your , take your sail to a sail loft and have them do the pressing rings .there are some alternatives , like i mentioned , you can do a webbed in stainless steel round ring .there we go .we have a nice , cleanly pressed ring in our nice big clew patch .so , it 'll be good all the ; all the sheet load pulling on this will leave you a nice flat sail .that 'll be good .we 're going to go ahead and trim off this access on the clew here with a hot knife and make sure it 's really nice and clean and looks good .
 , now here 's distinctly different lower third that makes a minor triad .same with d. [CLS] [SEP]happy sounding d major .now slightly sad sounding d minor , lower in the third from f sharp to f .
stretching the ankles in a straddle split is very important to keep the whole leg as a flexible unit .so we are going to start with pulling both feet , both ankles back towards the body. [CLS] [SEP]and then let us just start with the right side , pointing the foot , extending the ankle outward and then pull that one back and switch to the other one .so we are going to in a back and forth motion. [CLS] [SEP]and as you do this you should feel the muscles of the legs going back and forth , expanding and contracting on each side as we move and then let us draw them both up and both down and both up and both down and. [CLS] [SEP]again this is simply working the muscles that are connected to the ankles .again , breathing allowing your body .
now a flemish bend is a bend .a bend differs from a knot because it is a way of tying two ropes together in a way that you can untie them .now with a flemish bend old seamen really did n't like it very too much because back in the old days. [CLS] [SEP]it was mostly fibers or vegetable cord. [CLS] [SEP]it was really hard to untie a flemish bend because it had a way of tightening the knots together and binding them in such way that the rope was useless .in those days rope was very expensive and something to be used and prized .here we have our nice new rope which is not going to bind quite as much because this is because this is all synthetic polyester .i am going to start with a simple bend .to begin with we are going to twist this end under and actually create a second loop into a figure 8 almost. [CLS] [SEP]and then we are going to take this working end here and place it right into the first loop we made .there we go a nice start to a flemish bend .now what you are going to do with your second rope is to follow it through the same way .just back end and bring it around , fold it back all the way through , make sure this under piece comes back around and grabs both of these knots and comes back through and as you pull these together this creates a nice way of putting two ropes together .no matter how much tension you put on this you should be able to untie this especially since it is polyester cord and not natural fiber cord. [CLS] [SEP]this would be very easy to untie .
this cocktail is called the burgundy bishop .go ahead and fill your glass up with ice , and we are going to chill these ingredients .we 're going to do an ounce of light rum , a teaspoon of powdered sugar , that 's probably good , and about 1/4 of an ounce of lemon juice , that 'll work right there , now chill all those together .now take your cocktail glass , i am going to use a martini glass , because i feel like being fancy , you can do this in a wine glass , or you can do it like in a highball glass , and strain those ingredients into the glass .on top of that , we are going to pour red wine , any type of red wine will do , this is sort of like a red wine cocktail , there we go .so , you have rum , lemon , sugar , and red wine , that is your burgundy bishop .cheers .
there are many different tools used by a dental assistant to help facilitate treatment with the dentist , but these are the most important ones that a denta , dental assistant will use , this one being what 's called the air/water syringe .this one is also called a saliva ejector , and this one 's called a high volume evacuator .all of these instruments are used for either delivering water to the mouth in different ways , or air also , as well as suctioning out debris , spit , saliva , things like that .so , for the first one , this is what we call our air/water syringe .this is probably one of the most important ones .this one allows the assistant to basically eject air or water or both into the patient 's mouth .oftentimes , while the dentist is working ; whether it be taking a cavity out , or removing something the air , the air basically can be used to help keep the the field of view clear , and also make the patient comfortable .it also can eject water with the other button just to basically flush out any sort of irritants or debris that 's again , in the way .this one is the , what 's called the saliva ejector .this is the one you typically will encounter when you get a cleaning , and sometimes during routine fillings .this one is responsible for taking out , again debris and and saliva .some people like to call it the spit sucker .this is essentially what this is .it literally takes out the spit and saliva out of your mouth in a very quick , efficient manner like so .the last one we have is what 's called the high volume evacuator .this is the one most commonly used during fillings .so , if a dentist is either preparing a cavity , or they are removing an old filling this one generates a lot more suction .it 's also a lot louder , but this one is , again response for also assisting in keeping the field clear , but most importantly , it prevents any larger objects going into the back of the mouth .
in this clip we 're going to talk about the proper service procedure to replace your engines timing belt and water pump .in this step we 're going to talk about the proper service procedure for removing a cam shaft sprocket .and what we have here is a dual overhead cam engine .remove these air conditioning lines and you can see these are the cam shaft sprockets , and they 're over the cylinder head and there 's two of them. [CLS] [SEP]so that makes it dual overhead cam .now we have to remove the cam shaft sprockets in order to remove the inner timing belt cover in order to change our water pump .now what we have to do is break this knot loose .now one of the things you 're not going to want to do would just take a wrench and start running this cam shaft down .what you 'll do is actually operate the cam and you 'll run your valves into the top of the pistons .so what you need to do is hold this cam shaft still and then break the bolt loose .now there are special tools and various kinds of equipment that will hold this sprocket for you .if you 're a real lucky person. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm not one of those you could leave the belt on it , and actually break it loose with an impact with the tension on the belt .now the belt works about 50/50 percent of the time .most of the time what 'll happen is you 'll put your wrench on it. [CLS] [SEP]and it just revolve the engine around .so what i like to do and this will work every time is take another ratchet , what i 'm going to do is slip that socket onto a bolt in the inner cover .now from here we 're going to take and rotate ; you can see how the sprocket moves .what that 'll do is drive the sprocket into that other socket like so .it 'll jam up against here and hold that sprocket still. [CLS] [SEP]so i can break the , the bolt loose .alright , there is your cam shaft sprocket bolt .you can see it has some lock tight on it .you 're going to want and take lock tight back on it when you install it .we 're going to set this aside for later re-installation .wiggle my locking socket out of the way and slip the sprocket off .you 're going to need to pay attention depending on the engine that you 're working on is you can see here this sprocket is labeled .it says 2.4 liter front. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's got some arrows that says up .now as a cough cutting measure chrysler uses the same sprocket. [CLS] [SEP]however it uses it in a different direction for the 2 liter version of this motor .it says 2.0 engine front .as you can see the off set is different .a cam shaft actually sits farther inside on this one then on the other way .you 're going to want to pay particular attention when you 're reassembling it to make sure you have it put back on the other way .now you can get them mixed up from this way to this way , they are the same size .they normally are indicated which one is exhaust which one is crank shaft .so yep. [CLS] [SEP]just like i said make sure to pay attention and put them on exactly the same way they came off .you 're going to go ahead and repeat all those procedures for removal of the second cam shaft sprocket .
our next step , is adding the floss sugar .you 've got your carton right here .we 're just going to open it up , and experts say to always add the cotton candy , while the machine is running , but. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm an expert too , and. [CLS] [SEP]i say add the cotton candy your first time , before you turn on the machine , so go ahead and pour it into the spinner , and fill it right up , to about ninety percent , because if you fill it too full , then once you turn on the machine , it spins out , and you 'll get sugar all over you , and that 's never fun , so once that 's all set .you 've got your switches right down here , and go ahead and turn on the motor , and turn on the heat , or else nothing will ever come out , and you can control the heat right here .the higher the heat is , the faster your cotton candy is going to come out , so we 'll just leave it about middle , and see what we get .
as i said we 're going to use the raspberry preserves , we 're going to use apples from a can .that 's a regular size 21. [CLS] [SEP]oz . [CLS] [SEP]of apples in a can , we 're going to add a little bit of cinnamon and sugar .very little cinnamon because remember there 's plenty of cinnamon in the dough and raisins .this morning when i went to get my raisins. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]sure it happens to a lot of people , i shook the box it was like hard little rocks in there , but you do n't have to be concerned because all i did was. [CLS] [SEP]i took the raisins i put them in a cup with hot tap water. [CLS] [SEP]and i let them soak .now , before i add them to my apples i 'm going to drain them off all the liquid. [CLS] [SEP]and i want to show you how plumpy the are .see , they 're nice and plumpy. [CLS] [SEP]and i did n't have to throw them away .so that 's another great tip ,whenever you run across any dried fruit and you wanted to make it soft , soak in hot tap water until it plumps up again .so we add in our raisins .
alright so now let ’ s try a warrior three with a plie .this is a more advanced version .make sure you get the full warrior before you get into a warrior three with the plie .and plie if you are doing ballet is just a little bending of the knees .it 's a tiny bend , not a big bend , protect your knees at all costs .setting up for your warrior three , bring the leg back and the arms forward .now as you bend your supporting leg you really need to stretch the hands forward and the leg to the back .tiny plie and lengthen , tiny plie there 's your bend and come back to straight .tiny plie and back to straight .keep in mind that your core is really working whenever you do this .as the leg bends , keep it a tiny bend , stretch away from your core , leg going in one direction , head the other .as you do this. [CLS] [SEP]it 's going to engage more through your core , through your back and hold the balance .do n't go for height , go for length ,easy does it .if you feel any uncomfortableness in your knees , stop .alright. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's how you do your warrior three with a plie .
blood money is a registered trademark of io interactive , a company with which i have no affiliation .now we will actually go ahead and take this guy 's suit because some of the places that we need to go is more of an area for a worker than it is for the hitman .and so it will be easier to get through the level in the worker 's suit but we will pay the penalty for leaving our suit behind. [CLS] [SEP]but that 's just a bonus thing you can do .that 's not necessary to beat the mission and get a good rating .so we 're going to complete the mission in the worker 's suit .i see on the right side there , there is a picture in picture window of the rehearsal process where one of the actors has just pretended to shoot one of our targets .now , we 're going to use this as cover to actually shoot him while the fake gunshot is going on .oh , and there is the second target who 's been watching the proceedings .we 're going to use the rehearsal gunshot as cover to mask our fake gunshot and take out the target that way without anybody understanding what has happened until it 's too late .so we 're going to leave this area back the way we came , back through the costume room , and back down this corridor .and we 're going to go back into the area where the handyman was looking at the door and looking away .we had to time our entrance , but now that we 're in a worker outfit he wo n't be suspicious of us .
now i 'm going to talk about castanets .this is a very popular instrument in spain .you 'll see dancers using them , especially in pairs .now , essentially , a castanet here ; here 's a more traditional model actually made in spain .now you 'll see the inside is carved out , usually made of wood .now , the inside is carved to allow a chamber for the tone of the castanets to resonate in .the idea of this instrument is to have a small opening , so that when they make contact with the hand they make that clapping sound .now , you might also use those on their own , where you have a pair of castanets , such as these here , where you might wrap around your wrist , and so instead of just having one castanet you 'll have a pair , where in your right hand you 'll be doing that ; the same with the left hand ; creating different rhythms , similar to what you saw with the maracas .
all right , folks , in this clip , i 'm going to teach you how to draw rappers , hip hop artists .all right , so we 'll start with the face and work our way down .now one thing i would do , personally , is i would give these guys some character .i mean , if you 're going to be drawing hip hop , or rappers , or anything like that , it 's probably best not to make them look weak in any way .i would come in here. [CLS] [SEP]and i would give them a little bit of an edge in terms of eyes..i would n't necessarily draw them with big old , evil eyes , but i would give them , you know , relatively , you know , sort of intimidating eyes .come in here. [CLS] [SEP]are give 'em ...you could even put some shades on 'em if you wanted to .but , yeah , try not to make 'em look too unintimidating .most of the time they do n't want to look unintimidating , they want to look , you know , relatively intimidating .so what i would do now is i 'd throw , you know , some sorta cap on 'em .they 're obviously gon na ...i mean , they do n't have to be wearing a hat , but , you know , it makes it a little bit cooler if they got some sorta look like that .come around here and draw the side of their face .cuppin ' the ears .now , what i would do actually is i 'd throw maybe like , a , some sorta like , a bandanna number over their ears .like that .and then a hat off to the side .throw the hat on there .and again , this is all based on my own personal interpretation .obviously , you 're more than welcome to draw 'em any way you want to .but they got like , sorta the hat , the bandanna thing going on .basically , just trying to make 'em look kind of `` street '' that way .moving on down .come down here .now , the trick with drawing hip hop is that you do n't want to make it look cheesy , but at the same time , i 'm sorry to say , the hip hop style kind of lends itself to more of a cheesy look .like they wear really baggy clothes for the most part , which is kind of hard to take seriously sometimes .especially if you 're going to be drawing 'em .especially when they 're wearing those big old pendants which , you know , always look a little bit funny .like , so , if you are yourself a hip hop fanatic , then you should n't have a problem interpreting this visually ,because , let 's face it , that 's pretty much the way you dress , anyway , and so it wo n't be hard for you to interpret it .i , on the other hand , you know , i interpret what i see .so i 'm giving this guy. [CLS] [SEP], sorta like a bit of a bling look , baggy jacket , and i 'll eventually move down and give him baggy pants .but for now , i 'm just kind of like , thuggin ' him out a little bit .another thing you could do , i 'm going to give this guy a microphone , because he 's going to probably , at some point , be up on stage .so give him a nice microphone , cord coming out of it like that .another thing is pick a style , too .like , i mean it , for me. [CLS] [SEP]right now , i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]just , you know , choosing a style that i think works , but you can interpret this any way you want to .you do n't got ta follow my exact way. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm just trying to give you the building blocks and walk you through my thought process and why i 'm doing what i 'm doing .then what i would do is i would come in here. [CLS] [SEP]and i would give him the baggy jeans look , and this part is honestly my favorite part , 'cause you kind of basically just kind of work your way out .either side , kind of like this , til you meet down at the bottom .like that .and come up here , kind of in the middle , and you do squiggly line things to make the ...the jeans appear baggy , obviously .and you can come in here and throw in more detail to the wrinkles as you desire , kind of like that .and then to top it off , you got ta give him real stylish shoes .sneakers , obviously , stylish sneakers .make 'em flat , too .do n't make 'em look like mountain boots , or nothing .make 'em look , like , top of the line , primo tennis shoes .throw a little logo on 'em , too , just to give 'em a little bit of personality .now at this point , he 's pretty much done .and you obviously can come in and add detail ,like some of you probably want to throw on shades .and i do n't really blame you , 'cause honestly , shades look cool .probably a little bit even cooler than not having shades , so , you know , you can make those decisions on the fly , and easily go over. [CLS] [SEP]what you 've already done to make your rapper , hip hop star look a little bit more cool .so there you go .that is my visual interpretation of a hip hop rapper .
hi today we are going to do relaxation therapy for the forearm .when of the things about the forearm is that is where all the muscles are that control the hand .so it becomes very important to work the forearm itself specifically .and in doing this , as always , you have to begin a relaxation therapy session by accessing the tonal quality of the muscles .gentle squeezing , maybe some slight effleurage. [CLS] [SEP], that 's the stroking motion again always towards the heart when you are working with the extremities .and then you can start getting into individual muscles with a gliding motion , using your thumbs .a little bit of back pressure from your forefingers on the other side .you can flex the elbows some , work the forearm towards the elbow , again working each individual muscle group .this is a process that you can complete in three to four minutes .continue working and that 's relaxation therapy for the forearm .
now that we 've finished getting our drum ready for tuning - step one , pretty much - we 're going to start the actual tuning , listening in , checking for that sound quality , making sure all lugs are the same exact sound .so you 're going to start , right now , with this first one .i want to hear. [CLS] [SEP]- let 's see - hear. [CLS] [SEP]what sound ,where i 'm at in pitch-wise .and really you want a pah , pah .you want a really high-pitched sound , so we 're going to want to be tuning these a little bit more higher .yeah , that sounds about right .let 's see , put four on those .a lot of it , you just have to be experienced at listening on your heads and being able to tell when - if it needs higher or lower .you just got to be making sure you 're going opposites , making sure that one - every tone is the exact same , every pitch .wanting to be making sure that 's the pitch you want , and that 's the kind of style you want to be incorporating in your tuning .
alright now when you 're considering your choices of humor i want talk to you for a minute about being vulgar .alright , in certain audiences. [CLS] [SEP]this could potentially , possibly , maybe , a teeny-tiny-itty-bitty-bit okay .but we 're just going to say it 's not .the humor that you use should be tasteful .tastefulness and vulgarity are never a substitute for wit .that 's just really not funny .maybe at a comedy show , maybe ( whatever )different circumstances , but as a professional speaker- as a confident speaker-you want your humor to be tasteful .if you have any doubt at all that the humor choices that you 've made are going to possibly offend , possibly be vulgar , possibly not be tasteful .follow the rule of thumb .do n't do it .when in doubt , do n't do it .it 's not worth offending someone .
this first drill is very simply kicking on your side and how to use the head pillow , rest your head on your forearm .and when you need to breathe , you can just turn your head .when you 're ready to rotate to another side , you can shift .you can do one lap on one side and one on the other , or switch as you go along .but it develops the ability to kick on your side .the front crawl is really a misnomer because it 's only one-third , at best , on your front .rotation is the key to successful , efficient swimming .and the final drill is what we call the three-four flip-flop .you do three strokes of front crawl , and then rotate onto your back , four strokes onto your back , and rotate on the front .again , the idea being that it gets you rotating on both sides and gets you comfortable and flexible with the rotation needed to be an efficient swimmer .
go ahead and fill it up with sour mix almost to the top there and let 's shake those ingredients .this should have a nice raspberry tart flavor to it with the sour mix and the raspberry liquor and let 's pour that in and. [CLS] [SEP]the last thing we are going to do is just top it with some lemon lime soda .there you go , add a straw and bottoms up .
the marine organism we 're going to identify now is the peacock flounder .the peacock flounder is the most common flounder that one will find around the coral reefs of florida , the bahamas , and most of the caribbean .they 're distinguished by the numerous blue ringed spots covering its body , although the blue is often muted .these blue rings are what distinguished the peacock flounder from the similar appearing eyed flounder , whose rings are brown .peacock flounders , like eyed flounders , also have two and sometimes three , large defuse dark spots along the lateral line of the top side of their body .one usually behind the pectoral fin and the second about midway between the pectoral fin and the tail .the underside of the peacock flounder is a pale white to yellowish color , with no distinctive markings .the peacock flounder is a master of camouflage , they can rapidly change color and shading , to blend into their surroundings .their coloring can go from very pale , when they are over sand , to quite dark , when they are over coral .in addition , they will occasionally cover themselves with a fine layer of sand , making them even harder to spot .they spend most of their time skimming over the sand near reefs .peacock flounders are strange fish .they start their life like a normal fish , swimming upright with eyes on both sides of its head , but as they mature , one eye slowly moves to the opposite side of its body until both eyes are on one side and they can lay flat on the bottom without being noticed .the eyes can move independently so the peacock flounder has a great view of the world surrounding him or her .peacock flounders also have a very long pectoral fin on the top side of their body .this fin will often be raised while they are swimming across the bottom and will look like a small sail .i suspect they use this raised pectoral fin as a rudder , as they swim in an undulating fashion just above the sand or coral .adult peacock flounders range in size from six inches to eighteen inches with most being fifteen inches long or smaller .they are most commonly found in sand flats at a depth of two feet to forty feet .when they lay motionless on the bottom , in the sand , you might not even see them until you swim right over the top of the fish , which will quickly swim away if it feels threatened .peacock flounders feed mainly on small fishes they find in their sandy habitat .they will also feed on small crustaceans , such as , small hermit crabs , as well as small octopi .that 's the peacock flounder .
the foliage itself has stripes and they 're not like mirrors .most foliage is like a mirror -- there are stripes on both sides of the foliage -- but the cleopatra , it might have just one burgundy stripes on one side .it 'll be half burgundy and half green .there 's really no rhyme or reason to it .it might have a bloom that 's yellow with red spots , and then right above that it 'll have a pure red flower .so , there 's really no rhyme or reason to it , and it 's not a big canna lily .it only gets maybe 3 or 4 feet tall at the most , so it 's considered a medium .so it does n't really get as big as the durban or the pretoria that can get 8 feet tall .it stays a little more compact , which i really love about it , and no two plants are the same .when i plant 'em , i only put 'em about 3 or 4 inches deep , and i put 'em in groups of three or four or more .they like to be in groups to do well .and you only have to plant 'em , like we said , about 3 inches deep .and there 's little eyes , so the growth will come out of the eyes .so it does n't matter if it 's this way or this way ; as long as they 're covered , they will grow .they multiply quickly , so in 5 or 10 years , you can probably dig 'em up and divide 'em and put 'em in different areas or give them away to your friends and they 'll be your favorite canna lily as well .in the next segment , we 'll talk about tigridia .
so we 're playing a sample round basically of this little game we call bar dice .you won the first hand .we ante again .remember that the qualifying hand is two pair or better .it 's my turn to go first .i roll .there 's a pair of two 's ; i 'm going to try to build on that .nah , let 's have some fun , let 's have some fun .i have an open-ended straight draw .so if i , in this roll , get a one or a six , i 've got a straight .i 've got a one in three shot of doing that .there 's a six .i get a straight .so now you have to beat a straight .you roll .a full house would beat a straight and you 're on your way with two pair .you have a one in three chance of getting a two or a six to win the pot .let 's see what happens .drum roll please .it 's a three .alas , i take the pot .so that 's one pot for you , one pot for me. [CLS] [SEP]and i hope that you see now how the game of bar dice works .i hope you have a lot of fun if you decide to play it .
all right , the drink that we are about to make is called an auger .and , first thing we 're going to do is put some ice in a glass here and add one shot of vodka .there you go .any vodka will do , top shelf , well , anything in between and follow that up with about four ounces of orange juice .there we go .and , next , we 're going to do about a a half ounce of rose 's sweetened lime juice , any sweetened lime juice will do actually .now let 's mix this up real good .obviously , this is pretty much just a screwdriver. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're adding some lime juice .but , when you 're making drinks , you have the freedom to decide what you want to call a drink even if you add just one tiny , little ingredient .so , in this case , we have the auger .and , if you want to get really good with it , use some fresh squeezed orange juice .i know i would .
today we 're here to show you a few bmx tricks .this is the very basic wheelie .boy , i feel weird doing that one .the thing about the wheelie is it 's a very old school trick , and when you do it these days a lot of people ask questions .but the trick to the wheelie is counter-balancing the back of your body and the front end of your bike , kind of making a pyramid ; an upside down pyramid .now , you want to approach it with a little bit of speed , applying torque to your to your pedals .the torque is what keeps the front end up , but keeping your back end balanced is what keeps it very straight .just need a little tiny bit of speed , pull the front end up , and pedal ; just keeping that back end a little bit level .that 's the secret to the to the wheelie .
now to put it together , take one of your units , and take this other unit .this triangle will go underneath the rabbit ear , and then this triangle will get tucked into the pocket of the rabbit. [CLS] [SEP]ear , like this .tuck it in , and it 's in place .now , it helps if you collapse the units as you put it together .okay , take the other one , slide it in under the rabbit ear .tuck this triangle into the pocket of the rabbit. [CLS] [SEP]ear , like that .collapse it , and do another .slide it in , tuck the triangle into that pocket , collapse .and here 's the final unit , and the final unit is always the trickiest .so we slid the triangle in ; tucked the triangle into the rabbit ear , collapse it .now , we have to tuck this right into this original one .and we have to do it without without the unit falling apart .so , tuck that triangle in , and then lift up that pocket , and tuck that triangle right into that pocket .and there your unit is put together .shape it , and you have your five-pointed star .
our website is www.martialartsnc.com .this clip will demonstrate basic anaziwa or throwing techniques .as samurai armor was top heavy , as my opponent attempts a frontal or shonen strike , i 'm going to side step and move with his balance to step in the same direction , disarming him and executing a throw using mostly his balance from the strike .
what we are going now is setting this part of this block together .this is just part of the block .we will make it larger as we go along .but we need to lay it out. [CLS] [SEP]and i laid mine out like the book shows .i put my .we are going to have to square this up because this is bigger than this is .we are going to have to square this up so going to have to let me get my ruler again .these are going to need to be , let me see what this size is .going to need to be 2 inch square .so what we do with that is we take this diagonal line , which is a 45 degree. [CLS] [SEP]and we lay it on here. [CLS] [SEP]and we can straighten this up now .this kind of got crooked on us when we were sewing it .straighten that up , get those edges off .sometimes they do turn it around like this and get it on 2 1/2 .
it 's very important that you take your sections small enough and pay close attention .you can see in this section here , where the new growth is and where the grey is .and , just apply just that very small amount of color .you want to just cover the grey only .i do n't want color on all of this previously colored hair .you do n't want to overlap your color .you just want to get it on that grey .otherwise , you end up with an overlap and what we call a line of demarcation .and , you can actually see .tilt your head this way a little bit .there you go .now , you can see where her grey is and where i 'm applying the color .just draw that line , take your parting .take that small section see , when you pull it over it bleeds right through .that 's exactly what you want it to do .apply your color , pull the hair color and watch it bleed through .pull my next section and see how it oozes right through the next section .see how nice and neat you can work by sectioning the hair .getting the hair out of your way .pull that through and watch it ooze right through .just the grey only .i 'm working up to the front .and , all i have left is one section .here 's really , here 's a good part to pay attention to right here on the side of the head .remember , i 've put the conditioner on so it does n't stain her skin .but , i want to get those little grey hairs that grow close to your face .so , just on the grey hair only .and , then now you can actually see the color is starting to process .and , you can go through and see that it is totally covered .that 's how you pay close attention and put color on just the grey hair .
okay let 's get to the main element of fish chowder .quite obviously it is fish .classically , it would be cod that is extremely prevalent off the coast of nova scotia on georgia 's bank and down through boston even to the point they said you could just drop a bushel bucket and pull up fish without ever having to put any bait on it .those days are long gone unfortunately because we 've over fished .so it actually makes it a little more convenient .the one thing you have to think about in terms of fish for fish chowder is not an oily fish .i love salmon. [CLS] [SEP], i love tuna. [CLS] [SEP]they are very healthy for you but love chowder .that oiliness just tends to make it a very fishy flavor .so what we are looking for a white fish that has a nice clean flavor .meaning that when you smell it , it really does n't have a fish oil , like a can of tuna would when you open it up .some great versions arcog , you can use haddock or hake or scrod which is basically small cod .those are all great .this happens to be orange ruffie which is another one that you will find out through all the country at supermarkets .fresh , frozen ; i would always prefer fresh .i would always prefer wild caught but the real trick is to make sure that it is a clean fleshed white fish .
let 's play our e major scale again .now , let 's talk about our seventh scale degree which is d sharp .third high , third finger on the a string .relationship between sixth scale degree c sharp and seven is a whole step .you 're going to want to make sure that it 's not d natural , make sure it 's d sharp .
the next thing we 're going to talk about now that we understand the function of the wedge formation , is spooking the ambush before you ever end up in sight of it .when we look at the board , we see that the red team is moving on an objective and their direction of travel is indicated here .they 're moving in this direction .the green player is in a heavily covered position , he 's watching this shooting lane , waiting for someone to step into it .now the mark of an inexperienced ambusher is to spring his trap too early , and not let the players move through before he fires on them .one of the things that the point man on this wedge formation should be looking at and concentrating on , is staying close to cover as he moves forward , moving from cover to cover , and trying to step out and step back , so that he can hopefully draw the fire of the green team member who 's set up his ambush here .if he the red player does this effectively , then if he steps out and this guy opens up and he does n't hit him , each of the red players will begin to move still attempting to maintain their wedge formation , so that they can then get an angle on the shooter .once the wedge has moved and it can even become an inverted wedge .once that has occurred and you 've got angles ,other angles on the shooter , that player can be eliminated .
okay , now let 's talk about actions that you can do to maintain those friendships .alright ?always stand up for your friend , especially in his or her absence .you never want to let people trash your friends whether they 're there or not .always give emotional support to your friends .even if you do n't necessarily agree or disagree with what they 're upset about , they still deserve your emotional support .when you guys are together , try to make your friend happy .you know , you want to have a good time and enjoy each other 's company. [CLS] [SEP]so , what is your friend like ?do those things .always offer to help your friend in a time of need .really , you can offer to help anytime , but especially in a time of need .you know , they suddenly have to move out of their apartment , or whatever the circumstances are , offer your help .and last , but not least by any means , and perhaps most importantly , keep confidences .things that your friend tells you , they. [CLS] [SEP], you know whether they tell you do n't tell anyone or not , they 're generally , usually , telling you a lot of information in confidence .meaning they only want you to know , it 's only for your ears .and these are some great tips to follow for maintaining friendships .
now , there 's a lot of ways to find the center of paper .you can take a ruler , measure it , then measure the other wise , and split the distance .i found that 's always time- consuming. [CLS] [SEP]and i hate to take the time to take the ruler out and measure it .another way is that you can have the center already marked and put the paper over for light and then mark with it. [CLS] [SEP]a dot. [CLS] [SEP]so you know where the center is .you always want to stay in the center of the paper 'cause once it 's -- your drawing comes out , everything is centered .so i found the easiest way to do that is just take the paper , carefully fold it over , make sure your corners match evenly .i always hold my finger down right on there to keep it , so it ca n't slide and then run it .and i turn it and do it lengthwise .you do n't really have to run and trace down the whole paper ; you can just push it right in the middle right there .now i 'll show you where the center of your paper is .so now i know exactly where the center of this paper is just by folding it over lengthwise and folding it over widthwise .
you are going to need about a cup and. [CLS] [SEP]again a cup is about 3-4 pieces of bread .so we are jut going to put all of that into our mixture of peppers , onion , and garlic .we are going to mix in all of our bread. [CLS] [SEP]crumbs like so .look how nice this is starting to look. [CLS] [SEP]this is our filling for our meat loaf .you want to add about a teaspoon of oregano. [CLS] [SEP]and you can eyeball it. [CLS] [SEP]just a little punch and mix that in .we are going to get our mixture. [CLS] [SEP]our liquid mixture together. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to need our ketchup , our egg , our worcestershire sauce and lastly our barbecue sauce .we are going to need a quarter cup of ketchup. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm actually going to put it in a quarter cup measuring cup .just add that , we are going to need a 1/4 to 1/2 a cup of barbecue sauce .i 'm just going to go about 1/2 a cup .we are also going to also have to add our egg. [CLS] [SEP]so we are going to crack our egg .add that .lastly we are going to use 2-3 tablespoons of worcestershire 1 ,2 ,3. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to give that a really good mixed .we are going to mix this until everything is mixed thoroughly together. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to put this all together with our meat now and our mixture of bread crumb mixture .and make it into a nice meat loaf .so as what i was saying earlier this is the preparation you can do for the morning getting it all put together. [CLS] [SEP]which we are about to do right now .you can put it in your fridge for about 2 hours or all day at work. [CLS] [SEP]it does not matter but for at least 2 hours .so come back. [CLS] [SEP]we are making fast , fun finger sandwiches here at expert village .
squats open your feet shoulder length and you go all the way down , all the way up with your back completely straight. [CLS] [SEP], we do not bend our back that is how we get hurt , keep it straight , down , and up .are we ready ?demonstrate please down , down , down , down , down .if you notice hands do not touch the mat at any time or any other part .down , down , down .
so if you made over fifty-four thousand dollars , you can not use the free file program that the irs has set up .so we 're on the e-file site .we want to find a provider to use .now there are many , many providers out there , so we 're going to go down .remember earlier , we looked at the e-file checklist .very informative .i would definitely suggest you go there .we 're going to go down , scroll down .if you do n't have a scroll button like i 'm using here , you can go over to the right , to the arrow button in the lower right hand corner and left click it and see it goes down .or you can hold down the left click and you can drag it up or down to make it go smooth .so a couple options they ?re using your computer .we 're going to left click on the 'authorized irs e-providers ' .and you 'll see there 's a box .we can click inside the little box and right next to the 'submit ' button , you can punch in your zip code , okay ?punch in your zip code and it 'll give you a list of providers that are local in your area .now i have used several providers over the years to e-file my taxes personally and have a lot of friends that have used theirs .one of the ones that most stands out and is most well-known is called turbo tax .you can buy the software in a lot of your stores such as wal-mart , k-mart , etc ... [CLS] [SEP]or you can also go to their site .so we 'll do that .we 'll go to turbo tax .this is their home page .you can go up to it .the company , their parent company is intuit and this is one of their programs .type in www.turbotax.com and this will come up .in our next segment , we 'll take a look at more into turbo tax .
they 're suspected to be involved in a human smuggling ring and one of them happens to be a star in the italian opera. [CLS] [SEP]`` tosca ''and he 's rehearsing right now .and the other one is his friend and coworker who likes to come and watch the rehearsals. [CLS] [SEP]so we want to try to take them out both here at the opera house while they 're watching the rehearsal and involved in the rehearsal .so we want to come in the lobby and go down the stairs and go to the right as far as you can. [CLS] [SEP]and you 'll see there 's a handyman here that 's painting a door and a policeman .wait for the policeman to go into his door and then use your coin to distract the handyman -- working class , ca n't afford not to pick it up .so he 's got ta go pick up the coin and is distracted. [CLS] [SEP]so you can go into the door that he was working on and then come on down here to another area where you can see that there are a couple of characters running around .there 's one handyman here who looks back and forth towards the door and away from the door , and. [CLS] [SEP]we 've arrived when he 's looking away from the door. [CLS] [SEP]but i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]not sure how long it 's going to be .we 'll he 's walking away from it now so that 's good enough .
for our next step here since this is a virgin hair color what we are going to do is take your brush ( which has a rat tail on the end ) .in a slight diagonal we are going to take about a quarter inch section .now from the root to half way up is what we call your heat zone .so this is a virgin application what you are going to want to do is take it about a inch 1/2 inch to a inch above that .because the thing is heat process cause color .so if we put it right on the scalp it is going to process faster at your scalp then on your ends .you would get what is called hot root .so your scalp 2 inch away would be a lot lighter or even sometimes even deeper then the rest .so what we would go ahead and do is take your brush with your color .now that we have sectioned off the hair into 4 sections , what we are going to do is put our gloves on for safety .and go right into her color .since this is a virgin color , a virgin color application what we are going to do is take it at a 1/4 section here on the top in a slight diagonal .now half a inch is where the application is going to begin .from the scalp to a inch up is what we call a heat zone .now heat will accelerate deep color process .so what you are going to want to do is apply it about an inch to an inch away from the scalp to right about a quarter inch away from the ends .you would go ahead and put that aside , go to your next section same thing about a quarter inch in a slight diagonal .go for your color and apply half a inch to an inch bringing it out , away from that heat zone .bring it through the end here , put that aside and go in for your next .you are going to always want to go away from the face .you do n't want any color falling or dripping to the face and irritate the eyes .same thing about a half a inch to a quarter inch away bringing it through your ends .really work it through , you really want to distribute that color as even as possible .you just continue quarter inch section all the way down , half a inch to a quarter inch away from the heat zone bringing it through .you would continue this process all the way down to the end .so let 's go to our next step .
hi , i 'm gretchen rivas with relax to the max massage therapy .and today we 're going to talk about , how to find a spa .when you 're searching for a spa , one of the things you want to think about is , what it is that you 're exactly looking for .and if all you 're looking for is a massage , you may not need a full all out spa facility , but if you 're looking for aroma wraps , or seaweed wraps , hot stone treatments and some various other things that might involve showers , you might want a full fledge spa routine that 's available at some spas .so you would want to start by looking in some of the-you might want to look in the yellow pages , and you can google spas for this particular town that you 're going to , or that you live in , and see what they come up .and check out their websites and see what they have to say , because a lot of times you can get a lot more information out of the website than you can out of the yellow pages .and then the other thing i would do is , i would call and talk to the person at the spa , and ask them some questions about , what their facility is like , what they offer , how long their therapist have been in training , and how long they 've been out of school , and just get some information .because a lot of times spas hire people fresh out of school that really are n't the best therapist if you 're looking for massage work .the other thing you can do is , ask your friends and family if they 've been to a spa , and what they thought about it .and then once you find one that you think that you might want to go to ,before you book an appointment , you might want to just drop in and see what the facility is like , and then you can always book your massage or your spa treatment that day , after you 've looked at everything and make sure it 's clean enough to the standards that you 're looking for .so i hope those hints helped you on how to find a spa .
an easy tactical move that you would use in attack in fencing is called the apel and what it is is a quick stomping motion with your foot that is more about the noise than anything else .an apel is a kind of foot work. [CLS] [SEP]faint. [CLS] [SEP]so if i stomp i am looking for a reaction from my opponent .one is that it will probably elicit a premature reaction. [CLS] [SEP]so if my opponent parries it also gives me an attack to attack .it also gives me a chance to gage my opponent to see what she is likely to do if i am coming in for an attack. [CLS] [SEP]so it gives you sort of a bit of espionage there as well .so again an apel is just a quick stomping motion with your front foot .let 's show the apel in action in a short sequence that might follow .so if i am on guard with my opponent i give my apel and she will probably parry and pretend to get nervous if they think you are tromping towards them .this time i expect her apel , i disengage , come in line and she is not open for attack .if i move that sequence very quickly in a short easy way in , you have created a quick easy tactical attack for yourself .
hi this is taylor and we are here talking about hp cartridges and today we are going to discuss how to fill an hp c9396a .it is also an hp 88 which we will now show how to refill .the hp 88 cartridges are all refilled in the same manner .it does n't matter if they are extra larges , black or any other colors .to start refilling simply cut along the top line here on both sides , cutting just the sticker and the cap simply pops off .once you remove the top you can see the pump , the nozzle , and then the fill area .to get into the fill area you need to remove the rubber ball in this area .do not lose it you will need to use it later .once you have removed the ball put it on the side .the next step in refilling the 88 is to inflate the inside bag .to do this just get a syringe without a needle , stick in the side and inject the area .the next step is to actually inject the cartridge with the ink .to fill the ink bladder only insert the needle just about an inch , do not press too hard or you can pop the bag .slowly inject the ink filling the reservoir .it should take about 20 milliliters .once you have filled the 88 with the ink , replace the rubber ball , press down firmly until you feel it click into place .the next thing you need to make sure that there is no air .if there is air simply insert the needle and draw out the air .you can push the pump to create the pressure necessary for printing .
and i 'm going to talk to you a little bit today about how to understand poker .understanding poker really starts off with the basic premise of knowing what the hand rankings are .you have anywhere from a high card which is the ace and actually a lot of people do n't necessarily know this , but the ace of spades is actually the highest card in the deck .it actually would trump any other ace that is in the deck .the spade being the highest ranking suit .to understand poker , you need to understand the value of all the cards .an ace can actually be used as a high card but if you were trying to make a straight which is 5 cards in sequential order , not of the same suit , you can actually use an ace as a one instead of as a high card .as you go along , you need to understand that obviously a ten is better than a two so understanding some of the basic premises of just your basic math and counting that certain cards are going to be of higher value than others .after a ten , the jack would be the next highest card , that 's the one with a j on it .the next would be a queen and that has a q on it .the next card after that is a king which has a k.some people actually when they 're playing poker and they have two kings , they call those cowboys .so the rankings go from high card to a pair which is where you have two cards of the game number. [CLS] [SEP]then you could have two pair , say two fives and two tens , that would be two pair .so understanding those concepts are very key to poker and just real quickly to let you know , after two pair you have three of a kind , which is also called a set. [CLS] [SEP], you have a straight which is five cards in sequential order but not of the same suit .after that you would have a flush which is five cards not in sequential order but of the same suit , so say five cards that are all hearts .after that , and that 's called a flush , after a flush you have a full house which is three cards of the same number. [CLS] [SEP]and then two cards of the same number ,so let 's say three tens and two fives would be a full house with tens over fives .after that you have four of a kind , it 's. [CLS] [SEP]just like it sounds , you have four cards of the same number. [CLS] [SEP]so say four fours .then you would have a straight flush which could be in sequential order of the same suit .the highest ranking hand in all of poker would be called a royal flush and that is ten , jack , queen , king , ace all of the same suit .my name is dean hale. [CLS] [SEP]and i 've just given you a couple of tips to learn how to play the basics of poker .
it is not recommended that you use extension cords what this will do is create a power lost to the air compressor and you could over heat the motor .in addition this is going to draw more juice from your electrical panel and you could blow a circuit more easily .if you do have to use an extension cord make sure you use one of the proper rating as specified in your user 's manual .
hi , i 'm travis corpening , and here we are at kellina beach. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm about to teach you some tips for increasing circulation .what you want to do is after you worked out for awhile , and your muscles may start to get tight .and that 's from a build up of lactic acid .what you want to do to increase your circulation and get that soreness out , you want to probably find some kind of way to either find a friend , or a trainer to give you a massage and massage the problem areas when you 're actually working out .if you 're lifting weights or if you 're running , your arm , if you 're lifting weights or you 're running , you arms. [CLS] [SEP]actually your legs actually may be tired , really tired , so what you want to , may want to do is get them to massage your calf muscles , or your thighs , also , something else you might want to do , if you 're doing upper body weight training , you may want to get them to massage your shoulders , and your back .because your back can get tight when you 're constantly working out , doing , especially bench press .that , along with a hot tub , if you have a whirlpool , those types of things will increase your circulation and prevent , as well as heal , injury , and keep your blood pumping so that your body can repair itself .there you have it .increasing circulation .
look , increasing your charisma is not an easy task .you might self hypnosis. [CLS] [SEP]and there are some steps that can be done .one is timing .now if you see a really good speaker , ronald reagan , bill clinton , the timing is really important .now if bill clinton said , i feel your pain , no , he looks and says i feel your pain , and he has that voice that comes across in a charismatic way .now it 's the entire menage of what you 're saying .it 's the voice , it 's the expression , it 's the eye contact , it 's the look .you must pay attention to all of it , and if you want to increase your charisma , you need to practice because if it does n't come naturally , and to some people it really does , then you 're going to need to practice it .it 's a doable thing .but give it some time and remember , above all else , when it comes to the charisma factor , oftentimes. [CLS] [SEP]it 's about timing .this is doctor paul .may your fantasies of today be your realities of tomorrow .
ok in this segment , we 're going to show you how to hit a top spin , back hand approach shot .we 've already done the underspin shot , which you want to keep that low , but a lot of times your opponents like to pick on your backhand , but if they give you a weak ball , you 're going to use your backhand. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to spin it , keeping it deep , so. [CLS] [SEP]it bounces high in an uncomfortable spot for your opponent , and then because you 've hit it high and spinny , it 's relatively slow .it allows you to get to the net in a good strong position , so darren and ken are going to demonstrate how to hit a backhand topspin approach shot .all right darren , you 're first .hit it nice and spinny .hit it high .that 's it and come on in , and hit that volley .that 's excellent .all right ken , you 're up next , nice and spinny ,spinny , that 's it .now keep coming .that 's a great play ken , and one more time darren , and here we go .nice and spinny , nice and spinny. [CLS] [SEP], that 's it and come on in .that 's it. [CLS] [SEP], that 's a great volley .ken , nice and spinny. [CLS] [SEP], that 's it and come on up ,so when you keep it nice and spinny , it 's going to be deep .when it 's deep , and it bounces high , your opponent is going to be in a weak position , hitting it over their head hopefully , and you should win most of those points .
going to turn my tanks on .always when i get through with them. [CLS] [SEP]i shut them off .i 'm adjusting until i get a good , the flame i like .the blue tip flame 's a good hot flame .i 'm unsoldering this joint , because the fitting is wrong and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm replacing this pipe from out of the house .in some applications we have to replace the line set between the furnace , the a-coil inside and the outside unit .but this application my line set is correct size .i just need to do some modifications to it .come on .that 's what i want to do right there .
so let me quit out of final draft tagger and show you how tagging is done in movie magic screenwriter and so here we are .this is screenwriter. [CLS] [SEP]it looks very similar of course to final draft because scripts look the same we. [CLS] [SEP]all the same elements we saw before .here 's the title friends with benefits .here 's fade in scene one exterior tini bick 's bar in seattle night .of course it 's raining outside. [CLS] [SEP]it 's seattle .in stepping back page looks like a script page you should be familiar with this .to do your tagging in screenwriter you need to go up to production up at the top of the page .pull the file menu down and go to breakdowns .it gives you this choice tagging mode .that 's what you want and let 's go ahead and tag and item. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'll show you how it also operates differently in tagging itself .we 're going to tag raining outside remember .so drag and hold across it. [CLS] [SEP]and it pulls up this screen of breakdowns tags .you scroll down raining outside. [CLS] [SEP]we 've decided is a note .so here we go notes .now look what it does .it does n't color code it .it actually gives it this notation of nt and that stands for notes .let 's go to the next item .cabs splash by .click and hold again. [CLS] [SEP]the screen comes up here. [CLS] [SEP]it is .let 's go ahead and pick a vehicle .there you go. [CLS] [SEP]it creates a note of vh for vehicles and cabs are vehicles .taxi ads. [CLS] [SEP]it 's call. [CLS] [SEP]set dressing or prop .go ahead and call it a prop for fun .pr .so again in screenwriter you 're not color coding. [CLS] [SEP]but you still are tagging and. [CLS] [SEP]when you export these items into ep scheduling the nt the vh and the pr we 'll automatic slop into the correct categories of the program .so now that you know how to tag in screenwriter the last thing to know is how do you export .well once again go up to the production pull down menu , go to breakdown where you got into tagging mode and scroll down a little bit .i have an item here that says movie magic export. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's called movie magic because ep scheduling used to be called movie magic .go ahead and click that .it pulls up this screen .called production breakdown scenes .it just means what scenes are going to be included in the export .you can also add the name of the production company here click ok.save it .later on i 'll show you how to import data into ep scheduling .let 's move on .
you know interesting fact about yarn .my cousin was actually made of yarn .what ?now what ?uh ,yeah. [CLS] [SEP]so the weather , if you look on this map right here , there 's a hurricane .its coming right over kansas right now .if you look we got some real hairy weather .its hairy up here .this is called a wood storm .like , when there ?s lots of lumber jacks. [CLS] [SEP]and they chop the trees , the trees start to get up in the air a little bit and start spinning around .its similar , in fact , to ...okay , well ...those budget cut backs are killer .
i grew up on a farm in north florida. [CLS] [SEP]and i was always exposed to animals and one of the most fun experiences for me. [CLS] [SEP]was when the veterinarian would come out and treat the animals .we had cattle and i also had a pony. [CLS] [SEP]and we had pigs and chickens , etc .and the veterinarian would come out each year and vaccinate the cattle for various diseases. [CLS] [SEP]and i thought that that was very cool .i got my first puppy at the age of three and when we took him to the vet clinic i thought ,wow dogs have doctors too ?i want to be a veterinarian when i grow up and that was something that stuck .i never thought about or dreamed of doing anything else .i had a number of cats and dogs when i was a kid. [CLS] [SEP]so i actually watched a number of my pets suffer if you will because they were n't able to get the veterinary care that was needed. [CLS] [SEP]and i think that was what solidified my dream of becoming a veterinarian because when you own large animals and it is economically important for your livelihood , it is just not economically feasible to spend money on the pet animals or that was the mentality. [CLS] [SEP]and that is the mentality in certain rural areas where you are basically in a farming community. [CLS] [SEP]so i always kind of thought that some of my pets would still be around and that i would still be able to help them such that i do n't think i ever thought about doing anything else. [CLS] [SEP]and i am very happy with my career choice .veterinary medicine is a very challenging field to get into. [CLS] [SEP]and so my main focus was just being a good student in junior high and high school. [CLS] [SEP]such that i would be able to be accepted to a university which would give me the opportunity to apply for veterinary medicine. [CLS] [SEP]provided i manage my studying and kept my grades up to be able to enter the class .
today we 're going to talk about tarantula care .and the most important thing to remember right off the bat , is that there are three different types of tarantulas , there are obligated burrowers , opportunistic burrowers , and arboreal tarantulas , now i 'm not talking about species , i 'm just talking about a classification here .opportunistic burrowers are tarantulas that steel other animals burrows , being a rat or a rodent of some sort , or a lizard. [CLS] [SEP], they do n't need a burrow but they prefer one .a obligated burrower is a tarantula that builds its own burrow , and must have a burrowing area to feel comfortable .an arboreal tarantula is a tarantula that is going to live in the trees , or on bushes up high , that has lots of climbing room , which is important to know before doing your tarantula setup , because different types of tarantulas have different needs .always make sure you get the correct identification of the species of tarantula that you 're dealing with , do n't ever go by common names , get a scientific name with your tarantula , they have lots of different tarantulas out there and lots of different needs to them , so that 's very , very important .secondly , research , research , research , research the heck out of it. [CLS] [SEP], talk to everybody you can , it 's very important .as far as bedding goes for tarantulas , most people are going to use a coco bedding , which is a shredded coconut husk , a peat moss or a soil and vermiculite mixture .these are all bedding that are going to hold humidity well , but also dry out fairly well , and it has various different uses , they also tend to be rather light and fluffy and hold burrows very well , so it 's important to be able to give your tarantula. [CLS] [SEP]that if he 's a burrower .now as far as everyday care for. [CLS] [SEP]tarantulas go , the important thing is just to make sure that they have fresh water daily , and that they get fed basically weekly .most tarantulas do not need a high amount of food , 1 to 2 crickets a week is just fine for maintenance of an average tarantula , now it 's not going to be a rule , you kind of have to watch the abdomen of the tarantula and see if it 's getting bigger , smaller , and judging by that , you can judge whether or not if you 're feeding too much or too little .the other important thing to do is , if you have a tarantula that is a high humidity. [CLS] [SEP]tarantula , you need to be misting him probably daily , maybe not daily , maybe every other day , but keep up on it , he has to have that humidity to make him healthy to make sure that he molts properly .really , the trick to keeping tarantulas is getting their environment down , and if you can get their environment down , everything else is easy and gravy .they 're very , very easy to keep as long as you do your research , so make sure you know your species .
i am going to show you which bowl gauges to use , how to use the tools and the cuts that you are going to use to make those cuts .i am also going to show you how to use the scraper , sometimes the scraper can be useful in the interior of the bowl and. [CLS] [SEP]he way you hold the tools when you do that. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm also going to show you how thick you should leave your wall when you are turning a rough bowl .because the wood we are working with is green , otherwise , it is wet , you need to be aware of the fact that it is going to move .you are also going to need to be aware of knot holes that are going to be in the bowl or cracks that might have formed because as you are working with the bowl you are going to have to be aware of those cracks .you do n't want the bowl to break apart on you while you are working with it .
so , what you 're doing is you 're actually throwing the yoyo .you 're binding it and then re-throwing it back into the opposite mount .looks like this .so you throw the yoyo. [CLS] [SEP], what you 're actually doing is recalling it back .and you 'll notice , i 'm going to throw it into a brain twister mount .so it looks like this. [CLS] [SEP]and then i throw it back down .let me try that one more time .sometimes , you might need to adjust the gap .if your gap is too loose or too tight , sometimes , it wo n't grab or it 's going to grab too much .in this case , my gap is really tight , and you can see that it 's grabbing right away .so keep that in mind , if you 're having a similar thing happen to you , you just might have your gap too tight .so , what you do , one more time , you throw from a forward pass just like this , you recall , throw back down into a brain twister mount just like that .let me show you again .so , you can throw , that 's into your brain twister mount , call it back , throw into a forward pass mount , regenerate back into your brain twister mount , regenerate it back into a forward pass mount .that 's the basics of it .it just takes practice getting the feel .like i said as you noticed , in the beginning i was having a hard time getting it. [CLS] [SEP]just right .what you really want to do is adjust your gap , if your yoyo uses those stickers , kinda play around with them , it might be too responsive .it might be too loose .you 're going to have to get the right feel for it .and once you do , you saw at the end that i was finally able to get it .it just takes practice .it 's definitely well worth learning that because in the middle of the trick , you can just regenerate it back into doing something else .that 's off string regenerations .
quotes , david bowie quotes , those are very important to me .patterns , inspiration in patterns , inspiration in texture like that , and if you look at this , you can see like travel , i get lots and lots , let me take this off the wall and put it in the light , lots and lots out of travel .that ’ s a coin from spain , here. [CLS] [SEP]’ s some scrabble pieces. [CLS] [SEP], that ’ s a googly eye , my pet buddy ; he ’ s a source of inspiration .people give me materials , they are inspiring , you know that ’ s a , that ’ s a snake skin in vinyl that somebody gave me , wrapping paper from gifts , broken stuff , i don ’ t care whatever , little pieces of crap , this is from a construction site. [CLS] [SEP], i mean you know there is no end .that ’ s a piece of rusty crap. [CLS] [SEP]i found on the street , i mean , tetanus shots and what not , anything .i find whoops , watch out. [CLS] [SEP], i find inspiration , look at this one , this is really cool , my own private autobahn .look at the little car , isn ’ t that great ?i found that in the dirt at our house , i dug it out of the mud , i found , look vintage erotica , that is very inspiring , as a matter of fact. [CLS] [SEP]i did tell you guys i was going to show you my stacks of porn , come follow me , look at me .
next we 're going to add white , because we 're going to have a slightly windy day here , and we 're going to have some whitecaps going on .when i first add this these are going to be very strong brushes , very strong strokes across our canvas .if there are any remaining areas of charcoal that are kind of sitting in here , i 'm going to try and cover them up to make sure they 're all covered .now , once all these are on here , i 'm going to get out my fan brush .the fan brush is going to help us create some sea spray effects .call it a fan brush ; shaped like a fan .basically , what i do is take the fan brush , apply it to the white , and then pull upwards .make sure most of the upwards goes up , not to the side or down , and this is going to start to give a sea spray effect .it does n't have to be all the exact same directions to make sure what you 're not left with are really , really solid lines here .that 's not at all what we want .
and we 're going to roll it flat .stretch it out and make sure that it 's going to be the width of the stem. [CLS] [SEP]and you can kind of just eyeball it. [CLS] [SEP]and it looks like it is going to be .we 're going to take our poking device. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to cut the grass out of our slab .we are imitating nature somewhat. [CLS] [SEP]so nature is n't all the same. [CLS] [SEP]so the blades do n't all have to be equal .and when you 're done you should have something that looks like this .
okay , next we 're going to do some exercises for the love handles .amy 's going to put her knees together .now , she 's going to let them fall to the side .she 's going to put her hands behind her head .she 's going to look up .pick a spot on the ceiling .pretend there 's a tennis ball between her chin and the top of her chest. [CLS] [SEP]and she 's going to breath out and bring her shoulders up off the ground into a side crunch .so , let 's try that amy .so , as you notice , she 's looking straight up to try to keep her head in a neutral position .she 's breathing out as she comes up and this is going to work the obliques , her sides .now , if this is too easy , she 's going to go on and do a jack now .to do a jack , amy is going to take her inside arm and put it on her side .she 's going to take her other arm and put it here .now , she 's going to use her elbow to push down gently. [CLS] [SEP]and she 's going to lift her legs and her shoulders at the same time .let 's try this amy .she 's breathing up and coming up .now , this is a bit more of a challenge but this should be a good exercise for your sides .if this bothers your back or your neck ; do n't do it .now , if you really want a challenge ; stop using your arm to help .now , amy 's going to take both arms and point them forward .
in this clip on how to audition for a broadway play , i 'm going to talk about `` callbacks '' .what 's a callback ?a callback is something you want very , very much , a callback is when they a call you , your manager or your agent. [CLS] [SEP]and they say `` you did a great job. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'd love to have you come in again '' .they might say , they might mail you email you. [CLS] [SEP]some more sides some more scripts to learn .they might say we 're going to put you , you know , we 're going to have you read these sides with other , you know with the character you would be acting against .if you were in a romantic roll you 're the girl and they want to see you with the guy that you 'd be having a romance with .you have to keep in mind that a lot of time they do n't so many casting directors have told me this , they do n't always take the best audition .hey , you got to do your best. [CLS] [SEP]but you know you 're not going to get hired if you do badly. [CLS] [SEP]but they take the person who has the right look .the right look , the right chemistry with the other with your co-actor the actors you 'll be working with .i mean if they 've already cast three blonds and two brunettes. [CLS] [SEP]you know that they need a redhead , it does n't matter how amazing you are if you 're a brunette. [CLS] [SEP]you 're gone. [CLS] [SEP], you 're out of it .so the callbacks are , you go. [CLS] [SEP]you do your best. [CLS] [SEP]an it 's often how you look and whether you fit into the show .
the first step to unicycling , unicycling is obviously you have to get on the unicycle .so what you 're going to do first. [CLS] [SEP]is you 're going to put the seat in between your legs. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 're going to find something to hold on to .you can use a chain link fence or the top of a wooden fence that will work really well too .but it 's really really helpful if you 've got something to stabilize yourself while you 're getting started .next what you want to do is be really really sure to follow these instructions. [CLS] [SEP]is to make sure that whatever foot you 're putting on first that pedal has to pointed down .lots of people want to have the pedal pointed out or up because that 's what you 're used to doing on a bicycle .but if you do that remember it 's direct drive. [CLS] [SEP]the whole thing is going to fly out in front of you .so remember to put the pedal either down or down and pointed a little bit backward .so it will roll underneath you and you 're going to put one hand on the wheel to stabilize it and another hand on the rail. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 're just going to step right on to it .when you 're on top do n't hold on to the seat .just stay there and get your balance. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's how you first get on to your unicycle .
and , today we 're going to be showing you how to perform a proper inside crescent kick .ok.so , this kick for practice you can start feet about shoulder width apart and your hands out to the side .you 're going to be kicking the rear leg to the front hand .ok.so , you 're here .you could step out , swing the leg straight up and over straight to the hand .ok.so , you 're here .step out , hands out .pick up the leg and over .ok.if you notice the slapping , it 's because you want to hit with the bottom of your foot to your hand .ok.this is because you 're using this as a target to grab someone ’ s head and also to strengthen your hand for other attacks .ok.so , what you want to do again .step out , hands out .pick up the leg and kick .ok.from this angle .ok.so , he steps out .pick up the legs , swing over .ok.and , as you can see it 's a circular action .ok.you want to make sure you turn your hips .you want to pivot .you do n't want to try to struggle and stay sideways .ok.so , as you step you have to twist with your body up and over .ok.a simple application for this .so , he throws a punch .ok.you can block , move in , you can grab the side of the head .then , with your rear leg kick straight to the head .also , like for instance if he had a knife or something he could be stabbing inward .ok.you can kick the inside of the arm to open him up for a attack or try to kick the weapon away .and , that 's the proper way to perform an inside crescent kick .
knowing how to change a tire is a pretty useful trick and tip when it comes to being a mountain biker because changing tire for preference is the same for changing tires when you get a flat .so it always good to be prepare and know how to do this .with this specific tire and wheel combination we see we have what is called a press valve. [CLS] [SEP]it is a thinner valve then what you would find in a car and instead of having a valve cap to have it close. [CLS] [SEP]there is a little threaded nut which as you can see the valve is close. [CLS] [SEP]i push down on it. [CLS] [SEP]no air comes out .now i open the valve. [CLS] [SEP]and i push down on it air. [CLS] [SEP]comes out. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm going to let all the air out .it takes while sometimes it helps if i push down on the tire. [CLS] [SEP]a let the air come out a little quicker .you can hear it coming out. [CLS] [SEP]it looks like we are pretty good .
our next clip is going to be tricep kickbacks .gently come down upon the floor or your mat area and place your hands and weights to the side gently .okay you are going to roll on to your ball and now with this exercise you can stand on your toes or if you need to curve yourself around the ball you can be on your knees and you want to try to stabilize your body and bring your arms into 90 degrees , now of course it is going to be a challenge to balance on here. [CLS] [SEP]and you also want to keep your neck and shoulders relaxed .you are going to start off at 90 degrees , extend the arms back challenging the triceps to the side and then bring your arms back in .exhale as you go back and then relax .okay , extend them both back. [CLS] [SEP]and now if you want to change up your exercise you can always change up and do one arm at a time while maintaining the 90 degree angle with the other arm .it is just a little more of a challenge with your balance , beside the neck and exhale .
hi , i 'm mark middlebrook , and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm here in the paul marcus wines cellar , and in this segment i 'm going to talk about california pinot noir .it 's taking us some time to figure out the right places to grow pinot noir , because it 's really a great variety that likes a cooler climate , and if you plant it in the , in the , in the basin of napa valley , what you tend to get is a cooked , hot dark , but not particular finesse for elegant wine , and that 's really not what you want with pinot noir .so , i brought four examples here that the , they come from other places besides napa valley , where you can make some nice pinot noir .the first one is from anderson valley in the western part of mendocino county .it 's handley 's anderson valley pinot noir .you get the cooling influences of the ocean there .it 's not too far from the town of mendocino , and that keeps temperatures down , and keeps the grapes fresh , and gives you , again , some finesse and some elegance .secondly is ladd cellars russian river valley pinot noir .this is an area that 's been , where people have been growing pinot noir for some time now , and it 's a little bit warmer than the western reaches of anderson valley , but still cool enough because , again , because its proximity to the ocean that you get the , you get some of that finesse , little darker fruit , but the , but still a nice weight. [CLS] [SEP], nice balance to the wines .third example here is from andy peay .his sonoma coast pomarium is the name of this particular bottling .sonoma coast is a , is a big , kind of sprawling appellation , some of which is not near the coast , but the , this wine does come from right along the coasts there , and this , i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]sure you can imagine with the pacific ocean crashing along the , along beach area , you get breezes , you get fog. [CLS] [SEP], you get all kinds of cooling influence that give you nice , bright acidity , and again , good balance in pinot noir , and a lot of my favorite pinot noirs from california these days are coming from the sonoma coast , or the true sonoma coast , the part that 's right along the ocean .and finally , and example from cargasacchi , peter cargasacchi , his santa rita hills .i need just flip the bottle because he puts the , the appellation on the back here , and this is a downward down and. [CLS] [SEP]sideways country , it 's what is called the central coast kind of monterrey down to santa barbara , and it 's another area where , because of the , the , the influences of the ocean you get coolness , enough coolness to grow pinot noir , and there 's a lot going on , as you know. [CLS] [SEP]if you 've seen the movie sideways .there 's a lot of pinot noir being planted there , a lot of , a lot of good wines being made , and cargasacchi might be as one of the best producers .so , if you , if you like drinking pinot noir and california wine , pinot noir in particular , pay some attention to these different zones , and taste the differences and , and enjoy .
welcome back .we 're going to show you the supplies to do an abstract painting , and today we 're going to use your basic canvass .i believe this is a 9 x 12 or --no , this is actually 11 x 14.this you can get at any art store , local art store .they 're pretty inexpensive .i 've got some basic acrylic paint here .i 've got -- this is one of my favorite tools. [CLS] [SEP], you see me almost drop it ; it 's called a squeegee , and this is a really neat tool to do some really cool things with paint instead of using a brush .i kinda find the brush a little limiting when i 'm doing an abstract painting .this gives me a better -- i can swoop the paint around and do some really neat things with this and get some texture .i 've also got some --these are actually clay sculpture tools , but you can use them to kind of pull out lines and shapes when you have the paint on the canvass .and that is about it for the supplies .also i keep a canister of water here if i do decide to use some brushes .and i 've got a plethora of brushes over here .i also have this puffy paint , which is used on -- it 's made to put on clothing. [CLS] [SEP]but it actually is a really neat way to apply paint to your canvass .
and , if you do n't start bonking one thing into another , your doing ok.so what do n't you want to do ?what you do n't want to do , is you do n't want to have your flourishing bonk into itself in some way .so let me see if i can make a mistake .there you go .there 's a mistake .there 's another one .oh , there 's another one .ok , that looks crummy .but you can take that same idea and you keep things even and away from each other , not bonking into each other .then now you 've just created a shape and a tone .ok.here 's another one .this is a oops .do you know what i call these things ?i call them sweet nothings .possibly reminiscent of the cake do. [CLS] [SEP]dec whoops , no , do n't mean that , hold on .cake decorating idea .wait a minute .recognize that guy ?
ok.so , this is another portion of our stretch series .grace and i are going to show you an open leg stretch with your partner .now , this stretch is great for just stretching the torso the lower back and also your legs .you 're usually going to feel it on the inner thigh on the legs .so , with this grace and i are facing each other .our legs are open , our feet are together .we 're going to grab hands .and , what we 're going to do .grace is going to pull back. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to stretch forward .and , i 'll give her a little tap to tell her that that 's enough .and , then i 'll hold it there for about twelve seconds. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 'll switch ,so , it goes like this .then , we switch .grace will tap me when she 's had enough .and , i 'll have her hold it here .and , then we switch .ok.and , now we switch again .alright .and , this is a great team building stretch that really gets you a lot further than you would go otherwise .just because your partner is there to add more resistance and get your stretch a little farther .
and if you did nothing else , the swing would get you in phenomenal shape : cardiovascularly , strength-wise and in terms of your movement , proper movement .now , what you want to make sure whenever you 're picking up any weight , not just kettlebells , you want to make sure that you have your back in a neutral spine , your hips and glutes out , knees not tracking over the toes .and then from the floor , you 're going to swing straight through and keep it above the knees , breathing out at the top .there are variations of different types of swings , but right now we 're talking about the two-handed swing .
the cream sauce is now starting to boil .we are going to turn the heat down just a little bit .we are going to let that simmer and reduce .and our potatoes are done , so we are going to turn the heat off our back burner .we 'll drain our potatoes out .give them a shake and then bring them right back .what we are going to do here is open a can of green chills .we are going to just dump , because it is such a small can , straight in .then we are going to measure about a tablespoon of butter .add about a quarter cup of milk , about a teaspoon each of salt and pepper .then we will add a third cup of cheddar cheese .once that 's all in we will just go ahead and stir and mash .
this is gene mortensen , i am talking to you today about the challenge of the sudoku puzzles .and in the previous segment we talked about completing the squares with all of the possible numbers .and in the puzzle for today i ’ m going to be showing you how the process of elimination works so that you can pick the number that is correct in the proper square .you ’ ll note that in the top row that the numbers that are provided in magic marker , then we have completed the numbers that are potential in each of the remaining squares .we get to what we call “ twins ” be seeing that in this box and this box that the potential numbers 7 and 9 exist in both boxes .that technically means that there can only be a 7 and only be a 9 in those two boxes , so we can take a pen and mark out the 7 that goes potentially in that box and the 7 that goes potentially in that box .and by that process of elimination we ’ re left with the number 2. [CLS] [SEP], here is being the only number left as a potential number .by that process of elimination with the 2 in this row completed there , we can have a 2 at this place in that row and by the process of elimination that means the only number there is number 8 , which is the only remaining number left .when we take the number 8 out of this row we also take it out of this column , we can therefore delete the possible number there and. [CLS] [SEP]the number 7 is the only number remaining at that spot , which takes it out of here , out of here , out of here and out of here .with the number 7 taken there , that leaves only the number 2 in this box and that takes out the possible number 2 in this row there , there and there .and i think you can see by the process of elimination we gradually reduce possible numbers until we have one remaining and that ’ s how we complete the puzzle .
ok.to center something like this on the wheel one of our concerns is going to be how tall it is .we do n't want it to fall over .so , often times while we want to work very slowly and turn the wheel on very slowly and also place a finger on the top section up here .just to hold it in place while we work .now , what we 're going to do to center is take this pin tool here .i 'm going to simply take it and put it up against the edge of my pot .you can see there , how it 's drawing a line in the part that 's not centered .now , i 'm going to find the beginning point of this line and the end point of this line over here .put it in front of me .simply push the whole pot forward slightly on the wheel , ok , like that .then i 'm going to recheck it .ok.as you can see there , we 're pretty much drawing a circle all the way around the base of the pot .now , the more off centered this would be you would have a smaller line .the more on centered it is the larger your line is going to be .until , of course , it circles the entire pot like this .ok.so , now we have the pot on the wheel .the next thing we want to do is secure it .i 'm just going to put some moisture down on the bat , as we talked about before .in order for the clay to stick you want some moisture on there .so , here we go .put some moisture down there .now , we 're going to want to take some clay , break off a lump .for this it 's a larger pot , so i 'm going to use larger pieces of clay to secure it .i 'm simply going to put this clay on the edge , being careful not to push into the clay , into the pot .i 'm going to push the clay down onto the bat ; like so , and secure it against the edge of the pot without moving the pot .now , i 'm going to do this again ; again , holding the top of the pot to secure it while we 're doing this .one last time ; i like to use three points of grip .as you can see we have sturdied this piece of work up here so that we can now start working on the top section .so , next we are going to be trimming this pot .i will be talking about that in the next section of this lesson .
so upon of rising i come into my bathroom. [CLS] [SEP]and i do my morning ritual. [CLS] [SEP]you know we skip parts of it. [CLS] [SEP]but i do come in and wash my face and brush my teeth. [CLS] [SEP]and we have a whole house water filter which we are going to take a look at later on .but this way i could wash my face and brush my teeth in purified water that has no chlorine , no chemicals. [CLS] [SEP]what so ever .i think is really important to have the whole house water filter. [CLS] [SEP]so you do n't splash you. [CLS] [SEP]face and inhale chlorine gas first thing in the morning .i use all natural toothpaste .i have not been effect it by the most resent toothpaste scare because my have all natural products that are not imported from another country. [CLS] [SEP]and i use a all natural soap because i do n't want my skin absorbing any toxic chemicals .i wash my face , brush my teeth. [CLS] [SEP], i put my hair back. [CLS] [SEP]you know and get ready for my day .
and now we need to get all of our ingredients ready to make our gambas al ajillo .there 's 3 things that we need to put in this but really want 2 things right now that we need to prepare .the first thing is the parsley and what you want to do with the parsley. [CLS] [SEP]is you just want to cut the tips off , so go ahead and grab your parsley. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're just going ahead and take the tip , throw the stems away and remember this is why we need a sharp pairing knife because we want to have something nice and sharp to be able to cut this up with .if your using a dull knife this is going to take you all day and once again make sure you do n't cut yourself. [CLS] [SEP]cause this is really sharp and once you have the parsley , go ahead and bunch it all together and your just going ahead and start cutting it. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to cut it into nice little small pieces .the reason why you want to do this is cause we do n't want a lot of large chunks to be in there. [CLS] [SEP], we want the parsley in nice little pieces so that it blends in with the mixture .and be careful do n't cut yourself go ahead and turn it around and then slice it again , and do n't have to be exact. [CLS] [SEP]just want to make sure that you got it and some little nice diced sections .and that looks good , go ahead and put that to the side. [CLS] [SEP]and now we want to cut up the garlic .now we 're going to be using 6 cloves of garlic for this , but we need to peel them , so the best thing to do is you want to get the ends off of this garlic .because we 're going to be putting it into the garlic press once we start cooking , so go ahead and cut the ends of the garlic off and what this does is not only get the end pieces off it also makes it easier to peel the garlic to get ready to put it in the press .and we want to make sure we get all the skin off of this. [CLS] [SEP]so we just want the pure garlic .so there you go. [CLS] [SEP]it looks good. [CLS] [SEP]and we still have 5 more to go here , now when it comes to the red chili peppers you get red chili pepper flakes at the store which is what i got right here .but you can also use fresh chili pepper. [CLS] [SEP]you just got to make sure that it 's dried and if you just get that go ahead and just dice it up into little pieces because remember this is all going to mix with the shrimp. [CLS] [SEP]and we do n't want large chunks of it. [CLS] [SEP]we just want it to stick with the shrimp and to mix with the sauce. [CLS] [SEP]and this is how we prepare all the ingredients to get ready to make gambas al ajillo .
i 'm angela martindale , and we 're talking to you about how to transform your body like a celebrity .i 'm going to be showing you exercises to incorporate strength , flexibility , and balance , which is all part of your transformation .so first , we 're going to start off with a squat , just a plain squat .you want to take your feet , hip distance apart , pull your abdomen in , kick your hips back , hands are over the head .you want to just sit down like you ?re sitting in a chair and come right back up .that 's the correct movement for a squat .if you have trouble in your neck or shoulders , you can take your palms straight out in front of you , same position , sitting down and standing straight up .if that 's still hard for you , you can modify the pose by taking your palms in towards your chest , holding those abs in , pressing the shoulder blades back , and keeping those hips back , sitting on that invisible chair .pressing through your heels. [CLS] [SEP]so you feel the strength in your glutes .kick your hips back , pull the abs in , and sit down pressing through those heels , standing up , squeeze those glutes .again , if you have troubles in your shoulders or neck , you want to place the palms straight out in front of you , squeeze those abs , press back through those heels and drive up .so this is an inhale and an exhale down .so these are all full body moves that i 'm going to be showing you in this segment .they 're going to be working your abdomen , your core , your glutes , your thighs , your inner thighs , your calves , your stability , your strength and your balance .every single one of these moves needs to be done correctly with proper form , and they 'll be working your full body .just as a reminder , we 're going to do for the first week , eight to ten reps of each exercise and then in each consecutive week , you 're going to add three to five reps , depending on how you feel .
this is the snap on/off button right here .you can toggle it by clicking that or also by clicking the j button on your keyboard .right now it is off .i can slide my event anywhere on the time line .but if i turn it on , it is going to snap to each individual bar .now snapping to a bar because that is what it is set to right here .you can also set it to snap to each individual beat which is set right now at a quarter note or if you go down and click use quantize , you can set it to an even more detailed sampling .i am going to set it now to an 8 and that will snap your even to each 8th note between your bars .if you right click here at the top of the time line , you can also change it 's set to bars and beat right now .you can also set the timing to seconds to time codes , to samples , such things and. [CLS] [SEP]you can snap to those time frames as well but for the most part , you are going to want to use bars and beats .so you can see how useful when snapping can be when you are making music. [CLS] [SEP]and it is especially helpful when you want to go and loop music such as drum beats and such things .we will get into looping a little bit later but for now , i hope you can see how snapping helps out .there are a couple of more options if you click right here .you can snap it to different things and snap different ways. [CLS] [SEP]but i will let you figure that out for yourself .
another variation of a blues riff in e , using individual notes , what i 'm going to show you is basically again on both the e and the a strings and just going back and forth creating a nice blues rhythm .so , i 'm going to demonstrate that for you now .what i would like to show you here , is i 'm going to start again with e. [CLS] [SEP]and. [CLS] [SEP]what i 'm going to do , playing it slowly , is go .essentially , what i 'm doing there is playing a twice and then once on the g-sharp , which is the fourth fret on the low e string , and then playing open again .and then the c-sharp on the a string , fourth fret .from back to e and then picking d , fifth fret on the a string , back to e and then back to c-sharp and then back to e.so basically when i play it up to speed , i 'm going to go .and that 's another basic rhythm used in the key of e .
i actually had a guy who wanted to work for me who did n't know who the harlem globetrotters was .needless to say , i do n't think he 's going to be in this business very long , let 's be honest .but for those of us who love it , wake up and turn on the television wondering what happened in the world of sports , it 's a beautiful business .we 're very fortunate to be doing what we love , and we actually want you to get into the business , too .that 's why we 're doing videos like this .i want to tell you that when you do what you love it makes your product that much better .when you 're genuinely passionate about covering sports , you do n't mind getting on the road and heading out there , standing on lambeau field in ten degree weather to talk the packers .it 's wonderful .this is a great job , with great opportunities , and anyone who 's in this business is lucky .we really love this job and doing what you love. [CLS] [SEP]really makes it that much better ,like i said ,because you 're out there , you 're having fun , which is the most important thing .who wants to be stuck in a cubicle all day , typing on a keyboard ?you get to get out .you get to cover sporting events .you get to interview superstars .you get to talk to their wives , if you know what i mean .but , no .it 's actually a great job .you have a lot of fun , you meet new people every single day and you get experience .i do n't know what you think , but this is the greatest job in the world and you 're very fortunate if you 're doing it , so have fun doing it .
there are also other items that you would need such as the plugs that you would plug amplifiers into , the surge protectors that would protect your equipment from say a lightning bolt strikes your house. [CLS] [SEP]it does n't blow up everything that you own .there 's also other things such as picks and straps , even the gear on the guitar you can get replacement items for like the tremolo bar or the volume knobs .and then there 's some other items such as tuners , a metronome , which will all help you to make sure you 're getting the most out of your instrument and also when you 're practicing , keep you on target .
it is very important in any sport that you do especially in judo because we need a very strong mid section , strong stomachs , okay everybody down on your back .are we ready ?1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7 ,8 ,9 ,10.it is very important when we are doing sit up to keep our feet on the ground we do not lift or feet. [CLS] [SEP]and we sit all the way up .otherwise it is not a sit up it would be a crunch .
ok , so as we step up in difficulty in fives , we move into another combination five , called the over under .also known as the top gun .now , the top gun , you may remember from the late eighties was huge .it was very similar to the cabbage patch .it came out with fire , disappeared , but yet nobody forgets .everybody remembers the top gun , the need for speed .the difficulty level in the top gun comes from the high five , the common high five , dropped down to the low five .you have to be high low , and then low high .to get the proper percussion on the top gun , on the over under .you have to be in sync with your partner .this is one of those high fives that you do n't want to commit to it unless it is somebody you 've been fiving with for a long time .like good and maverick .thank you buddy .or somebody you really hit it off with right away .you feel that cosmic connection in the five .this is one of my favorite fives because of that very reason .the top gun .
welcome back .jayne entwistle : we 're playing some of our favorite improv games and now we 're going to play a very famous , popular game called freeze tag .how this game works is people are doing action on stage -- it could be one person , it could be two people , it could be many people .somebody calls `` freeze '' and what they do is they tap out the person that they want to replace , and then they take their exact spot .okay , this works on a few skills .first of all , it works on really paying attention and trying to recreate what 's going on ; also , sort of the quickness of allowing your improv mind to take over without judging or critiquing yourself .so we 're going to do a little -- give you a few examples of how freeze tag works .for this , andrew , why do n't we -- we 'll be on a ship .andrew stubblefield :okay .jayne entwistle :okay ?and we 'll just sort of give you some example .normally , we would have a scene partner that we 're playing with , but we 'll just give you some examples .andrew stubblefield : and also , each one of these scenes can generate and create a completely different new scene .it has nothing to do with the scene before .i mean , it can , but it does n't have to .jayne entwistle :right .all right , so -- andrew stubblefield. [CLS] [SEP]: so , do you want me start ?jayne entwistle :yes , you start .andrew stubblefield :okay .aaarggh. [CLS] [SEP], i hate scrubbing the deck .it 's the worst job on a ship .i wish i was a captain .jayne entwistle : freeze .i thought they have poles to hold the flags .how come i have to stand on this and hold the flag all day long ?my arm is getting tired .andrew stubblefield : freeze !we 'll be late for that meeting , i know it .stupid public transportation .excuse me , can you go any faster ?geez .jayne entwistle : freeze .i can feel it , i can feel it .the apple 's going to fall right into my hand .come on apple , come on apple .all right ...andrew stubblefield :great .jayne entwistle :...so that 's an example of freeze -- freeze tag .right .
how to get abs of steel .well we all want those right. [CLS] [SEP]so how do you do that .well everybody that does a lot of abs while they may not necessarily have a revealed six pack could actually have abs of steel .because if you touched them they would be rock hard .there 's times when i may not be as lean as i am other times of the year , where while i may not have what you would consider a six pack. [CLS] [SEP]but if you hit them they are rock hard .and so you can have abs of steel. [CLS] [SEP], so do n't worry if you are over weight or you have too much body fat cause. [CLS] [SEP]that 's a whole different topic .is how to get a six pack .but to get rock hard abs , my favorite exercise is leg lifts .it 's not overly difficult , it 's something most people can do .i very rarely seen it where somebody ca n't do it .the important thing about anytime you do. [CLS] [SEP]any body shaping is always focus in your mind. [CLS] [SEP]what body part you are working .and you need to focus on it .i call it engaging the body part , when i do a curl , i do n't sit there and start thinking about my calf .i 'm trying to contract my curl so same thing with the abs .when you do this exercise some people say i feel it in my legs. [CLS] [SEP], i feel it in my lower back ,well you know what you are not thinking about your abs .stay in your abs , right now i 'm in there , slow little pants , it 's not you are. [CLS] [SEP]probably are over training .you should be able to just calmly do these .i do four sets of twenty of four sets of twenty five , probably three to four days a week .i at least do it every time i 'm at the gym .i do n't see why not .there 's a million of these benches sitting around , there 's always an end .so one can even use the other end if you are training with someone .for sets of twenty five and over time you 'll get those rock hard abs .so keep it up and good luck .
snapping of the blade is achieved by a quick move off the hand as oppose to .when you glide you pass through all the tones and microtones in between the notes .when you snap you go directly from one note to the other .
we 're going to start outside of the water using a kick board that you can get at any swimming pool that you 're going to. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 're going to get in the water and show you how it is done inside the water .so if you 're parent trying to teach your child how to swim or an adult trying to learn how to swim for the first time , it 's a good tool to use .okay , so we 're going to put this kick board on the floor and lay with your stomach on the kick board .the feet are close together when you start the stroke .alright , you open slightly your knees and bend your knees towards your body as much as possible .it 's real important that it be as close as possible cause you want to get a strong kick .then you open your legs , the knees do n't move they stay in the same position .in a circular motion you bring the feet back to the same position you started from .okay , so one more time , you bring your feet close to your body with your knees slightly open , you circle the knees outside and bring it back .make sure you do n't do this and this , because you 're not going to get any kicks out of it .now , we 're going to show you the same thing but in a different angle. [CLS] [SEP]so you can see how it works .in the breaststroke kicks simulates to the frog , okay in the water .if you ever see a frog in the water , how a frog swims .so the same thing one more time , you start with your feet , you 're bending from your knees , both feet together and make sure the knees are slightly open .okay , then you circle the knees outside of your body and bring it back straight from the position you started from .
people who work in the hospitals or the nursing homes .believe me , the people who live in nursing homes and people who are stuck in hospitals need some comic relief .and those jobs can be done for pay or for free .but there are a lot rules you have to know and remember .when you are in the hospital , you have to wash your hands all the time .wash your props , keep clean .but it 's great !it 's almost all one on one , someone sick lying in bed. [CLS] [SEP]and you could do a silly trick like my hat rising .and the kid screams out you ?re just lifting it with your fingers , but look , there 's nothing in my hat , and now i am going to make a rabbit .poof !look at that rabbit !abracadabra !poof !the rabbit is gone !one more time !abracadabra !poof !a rabbit !a rabbit !yeah , it does n't take much to make someone in the hospital laugh .even silly things .you should give it a try .
alright , now that we have our eight spices mixed together. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to take some butter and grease our baking dish , then we are going to cut our vegetables .very simple , we 're just going to slice mushrooms , grab them up and put them on our baking sheet .then we 're going to take the bottom half of our red pepper to try to avoid the seeds up at the top , we 'll cut that in half , cut off the white ribs , and we 'll cut these in strips .alright , now we 'll mix these with our mushrooms , making sure that the strips are all separated from one another .i 'm going to add about 1/2 a tablespoon of oil , give these another good stir , and then we 'll make sure that they 're nice and flat , and we 're just going to shake our eight spices right over the top , then we 're going to put this in the oven , and it 's only going to have to bake for about 10 minutes .
first we take this brinjal , which is already cooked , which is made out of roasted brinjal , onion and tomato and , of course , pepper and salt .now we take a slice of bread and apply this mixture all over the slice evenly and then place another slice of bread on this .and then place it on the toaster and leave it for three to four minutes .so now , after four minutes , your toast is ready .so let 's see .now we take this toast , since it 's properly toasted , place it on a plate. [CLS] [SEP]and then we can have it with either tomato ketchup or maybe mustard sauce , as per your wish .so here you go , your toast is ready .

[CLS] [SEP]using a jigger to measure this out , you can get this at a bar supply store or a liquor store , and it makes it really easy to measure out your drinks .then i 'm going to add a juice of about a 1/4 of a lemon , and i 'm going to use mine from a bottle , because i throw a lot of cocktail parties , so just about a big squeeze there , and i do n't like to squeeze lemons all night. [CLS] [SEP], i like to actually hang out with my friends and enjoy my party .alright , next we 're going to add about a teaspoon of maraschino liquor , just a splash , and we 're going to shake this up .we 're going to strain this into a cocktail glass , and it 's trying to get away from me , there we go .go ahead and strain that , and you have the option of adding fresh mint sprigs if you like. [CLS] [SEP], i also like to garnish this with a cherry , because it 's got the maraschino liquor in it already , there you go .enjoy your sensation cocktail .
to one of two they have , they use daily painting many , many cars every week .the way that this particular booth works. [CLS] [SEP]; the air comes in the top , enters the booth from the top and is drawn downward so that all of the excess paint material that is floating in the atmosphere inside the booth is taken down into filters and is captured so that it 's not taken up into the atmosphere that we breathe every day .here we are inside the spray booth ; this vehicle is prepared for shoot .like i said you do n't want to touch it .as you can tell all of the primer has been in this area of repair. [CLS] [SEP]and they 're going to blend colors both directions .that way they 'll bring the color just a little bit into this door and fade it out gradually that way there is not a stark break of color , it 's blended in .then once all the color is on , that 's your first coat , they 're going to let it set for about 15 minutes , then they 're going to come. [CLS] [SEP]and they 're going to clear all of this other area .everything that you see that 's unmasked will be cleared with a clear coat .and that will give it that deep luster and the color will blend in , it 'll match perfectly .so let 's take a look at the painting .
in this clip i will show you how to fold the umbrella base .this is a base that is similar to a frog base except one less step than the frog base .with the umbrella base we are going to start out with a preliminary base and the raw edges or the open edges towards you. [CLS] [SEP]we are going to do , we are going to lift up each of these sections and do a squash fold .and we 're going to do this four times because we have four sections .this is similar to our frog base .so this is one section turn a unit to the other side , lift up this other section and squash fold down , now turn this flap to the left and lift up this section on its axis and squash fold making sure that the center crease aligns with the center folds beneath .and turn the unit to the other side , fold this section to the left .lift up this section on its axis and squash fold .now we are going to fold one of the top sections to the left and since we did it on the top we have to do it on the back .fold one of the sections to the right so that the unit is balanced .there are four sections on each side .with the open flap the very top layer we are going to fold that triangle up. [CLS] [SEP]so we have a nice white triangle .and do this for all four sections .fold up that triangle , open it to these sections , open it and fold up those triangles .turn the unit to the other side and you fold it .fold up the triangles .this is a complete umbrella base .
hi , i 'm magician paul weatherbee , and i 'm going to show you a little stunt with a spoon .a normal spoon , as anyone can see .watch ; if you take the spoon , you can bend it just like that , and give it a rub , and it 's totally unharmed .i 'm going to show you how to do this one .when you hold the spoon , hold it just like this , but you 're not really bending the spoon .you 're opening up your right hand just a little bit , and moving your right hand ; the back of the spoon comes right out of your hand just like that .that 's what it looks like from the side ,so you can see it coming out , but from the front , it looks like you 're actually bending the spoon .this is a great little stunt to do at restaurants , or at formal parties .everybody loves it and can have fun with it .one more time ; the bending spoon .and that 's the bending spoon .until next time , keep the magic in your life .
okay now these are n't actually , this is not actually a beard trimmer , these are actually horse clippers but most people. [CLS] [SEP]probably do n't have those laying around .but if you do , these are actually awesome .kind of go at an angle through the hair .you do n't want to go with the hair .at a slight angle or against it .now you have to change your angle once you get to the backbone there because the hair obviously is going to switch directions .
we 're talking about skateboarding parts and maintenance. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to talk about placing and rotating worn wheels .eventually you will have to replace or rotate the wheels on the skateboard .after usual wear and tear , you 'll notice that a skateboard wheel can start to have a curve to one angle .to balance this out simply rotate the tire or wheel to where the wide part is now on the outside , this will wear the wheels evenly and give you a straight ride .you also want to replace your wheels if they get so worn down that they become too small to be effected .to replace a wheel simply use an appropriate wrench size back the nut off simply slide the wheel off of the axle , turn it around or replace it slide it back on and replace the nut .the most important part of replacing wheels is making sure that the nut is on firmly to attach the wheel to the axle .but not so much that it prevents rolling .there should be a slight bit of play in between the nut and the bottom part to where the wheel touches the truck .a slight shake is exactly where it needs to be , too much causes too much wobble .if you tighten it too much , then the wheel will barley move so. [CLS] [SEP]remember replace your wheels when they get worn out on one side or worn out all together .remember tightening and loosing the wheels properly is the key to skateboarding maintenance .
one of the other more effective moves you can do during the game is called a no look pass .which , you got to watch. [CLS] [SEP], you do n't want to hot dog it. [CLS] [SEP]but , and for especially in front of the coaches because some of them might not like that .but , the no look pass simply is exactly like it says .if i 'm coming down court and , were coming down court and , let ?s say he over here on the other side of the paint. [CLS] [SEP]and , i 'm driving. [CLS] [SEP]just like i want to shoot so. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm driving full speed. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm looking. [CLS] [SEP]like i want to go up with the shot. [CLS] [SEP]so , i 'm right here. [CLS] [SEP]and the defense thinks i 'm going to shoot it .say , it 's a big man. [CLS] [SEP], he might be shaq , and i know he 's going to block my shot. [CLS] [SEP], i go up like this. [CLS] [SEP], everybody else thinks i 'm going for the shot too !while i 'm going like this i drop it off to him , just like that .so , it 's hundreds of different ways you can do the no look pass .i can do the no look pass coming down court simply going the other way. [CLS] [SEP]or , i can do the no look pass ,the no look pass shoveling it. [CLS] [SEP]but , you got to sale a move before you do the no look pass .plenty of guys just think , okay. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to look over here and do it which might work. [CLS] [SEP]but , you can not do. [CLS] [SEP]the no look pass when you do n't sell something else first .so , coming down court i 'm going to show you one more no look pass coming down court and , actually looking. [CLS] [SEP]like you 're going up for the shot .so , i 'm going to show that in full speed .so , here you go , i 'm coming down court , so. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm looking like i 'm going to shoot it. [CLS] [SEP]and , i drop it off .so , you want to sell something else before you do that no look pass .there you have it. [CLS] [SEP]the no look pass .
and you 're going to loop out. [CLS] [SEP]and you are going to bail every time .so while doing in kind of get your weight and come to the corner behind you give it a good pump. [CLS] [SEP]and if you need to give it a crank in here .when you get up to the lip here , do n't try it the first couple of times get a feel for the ramp and see how fast you 're going to have to go to get enough speed to coast all the way around .like i said you want to kind of get a medium to slow pace going. [CLS] [SEP]so go up the corner. [CLS] [SEP]a little bit give it a half crank if you need to and then up the ramp .remember if you go too fast you 're going to loop out and your going to bail every time , slow to medium nice and control .
form the expansion , volcarren wasteland from heroscape .now here we have our orc guy and he is going to try to get across the board. [CLS] [SEP]and he has a move of five. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's going to be 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5. [CLS] [SEP]and since he ended up landing on and in molten lava then he is going to take molten lava damage .now , for lava field damage , you roll one attack die for a wound counter or attack or lava damage -- lava field damage and in this instance , we 're going to roll a twenty sided dice .as you can see , there are twenty sides to this dice. [CLS] [SEP]so you 're going to roll. [CLS] [SEP]and i roll the one .now , with molten lava , you have to roll a twenty because anything that is not a twenty will have your creature killed .that 's right .twenty will save your creature 's life and one through nineteen causes your creature to be destroyed which means it has to leave the game. [CLS] [SEP]and you can no longer play with it .
i 'm familiarizing myself with the situation and how it might translate into shapes of light and dark .i 'm looking at the gesture of the figure , and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm kind of anticipating what this might ...what colors i might use .what 's important in a thumbnail sketch is that this is not really something for the public to see ; it 's a personal kind of quick look at what 's going on .what 's the essence of the composition ?okay , and just that gives me the idea of how light is moving through this composition .
my name is travis caldwell. [CLS] [SEP]and i am currently an operations manager at a company called dialogue marketing , incorporated where we manage various clients in the telecommunications/telemarketing field ranging from sales to inbound customer service .and as a manager there i have advanced from supervisor and from experience in previous positions and previous employers where i was actually a representative in both outbound and inbound programs .a telemarketer or someone in telecommunications is someone who either calls up individuals or their program if they are trying to sell them something. [CLS] [SEP]or if they are trying to add on to whatever service they have on currently. [CLS] [SEP]or it is customer service , basically where the customers call in and ask questions about billing and different things like that such as what is my account status , things like that .so that is what a telemarketer is essentially and what their responsibilities consist of are. [CLS] [SEP]basically they come , they clock in. [CLS] [SEP]they make themselves available on their phone and they start taking phone calls .depending on the program they will either call individuals up and either solicit things from them or do surveys and as they go depending on what the program requires and the scripting , because they 'll follow a script , the call will prompt and they 'll go through and ask the questions and read the specific verbatim points. [CLS] [SEP]and then they 'll get through a sale .and depending on what their shift is like they 'll go through anywhere from 20 calls to over 100 calls a day depending on just how quickly they handle the customers and how quickly they get through the scripting .on the inbound customer service side it will be a different experience in that customers are calling them for assistance and basically they 'll answer their questions based on the billing .is my phone working for example if they are in customer service for a cellular service , they 'll trouble shoot and help them get their phone working. [CLS] [SEP]and that is basically a telemarketer 's responsibilities in a nutshell .
hi , my name is lauren and today , i 'm going to discuss hair drying tips .after you get out of the shower , you 're , and you wring out most of the moisture from your hair. [CLS] [SEP], you 're going to take your damp hair , you 're going to place a little product in it .emulsify the product really well within your hands , go through the ends of your hair first , and then work your way towards the root in order to prevent putting too much product , and give , giving your hair more of a greasier look .if you 're in trying to keep volume , what you 're going to do is put a root lifter , if you have one , and then you can just spray that .that 's the only product that will goes essentially , only by the root .once you 've done and placed your product in , you are actually going to lift your hair and direct your hair to where you want it to go .your hair , because of your own natural body heat , will dry by the root quicker .so , rather than section it when it 's very wet and getting , starting from the bottom and working your way up. [CLS] [SEP], you 're not going to achieve the volume that you may want on the top .you 're going to lift your hair in smaller sections , using your hands .focus your blow dryer onto your root and work your way onto your root and work your way up from your root to your mid-shafts .you are going to do this all throughout your entire head , in order to promote volume and get the shape that you want on your hair .once your hair is about eighty percent dry , that 's when it 'll really start taking shape .i recommend maybe use a clip .clip the hair , section some of the others out of the way .get a round brush , if that you want to tri ...curl it under .it can either be , it should be ceramic based in order to kind of heat up the ceramic .you 're going to roll it in , almost as if it was a curler .you 're going to heat up the ceramic with the hot air. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 're going to use the cool button .the cool button is going to set in the style that you are looking to have .so if you were looking to roll it under , it will actually help your hair stay there .so you 're just going to pull your hair out .release the brush when it 's done and it should bevel under .you will do this for the rest of your hair .as long as you dry about eighty percent beforehand , you will be fine and it will cut down on your drying time and it 'll make it a lot quicker and a lot more effective .and that is tips on drying your hair .
after you 've tried hopping down stairs you can try going in the opposite direction .it may seem like it 's easy once you 've mastered going down. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's much , much , much more physically strenuous .so once again , start out with a smaller flight of stairs .start out maybe even on a curb because they 're about the same height .and basically you 're going to use the same technique that you did when you were going over an obstacle .so you ride up to it so that your wheel is parallel and then you 're going to allow your body to lean .and for stairs you 're going to have to lean a lot because you 're going up high. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're not landing down on the other side .you 're landing high too .so you have to lean a lot , allow your body to fall over the direction you want to hop a lot. [CLS] [SEP]and then you can hop the unicycle up to keep it underneath you .once again you can use little hops to regain your balance once you begin up the stairs. [CLS] [SEP]but it is more efficient if you just use one hop going up each stair .so , here we go .so get your feet in the right place .hop over to where you want to start .allow your body to fall and continue up the stairs .and that is how you hop up a flight of stairs .
hey guys , in today 's topic we 're going to talk about how a dj mixer works .let 's take a look at this .in your basic dj mixer you usually got two channels , left and right .and those are really basically your left and right sources , in this case two turntables .and then you 've a selector switch for your cue , or for your headphones .that 's going to cue your headphones from left to right .and basically what happens all throughout the night as you 're djing , is the dj is basically one step ahead of the crowd , and basically in the headphones cuing up the next song , before he actually brings it in , and turns the volume up for the crowd to hear .let 's get familiar with the parts of a dj mixer .in any dj mixer you 're going to have a gain , which is to say the volume coming into the mixer from the turntables .you 're also going to have a section of equalizer , low frequency , mid-frequency , and high frequency .and then you 're going to have a volume fader which controls the volume that goes out to the house , and the house is basically what everybody else is listening to .is also on most dj mixers got , a basic cross-fader which fades back and forth between the left sound source and the right sound source .and you 've got a master volume , and that master volume is your volume for the house .that 's a basic dj mixer .
ok , our first step in our bedroom project is going to be addressing the ceiling .its fairly common in an old place like this for you to get a lot of cracks .essentially what 's happening is the plaster is separated from the material underneath it. [CLS] [SEP]and hence we get a lot of cracks .so i 'm going to show you how to address that .we 'll be taping those cracks up and applying some joint compound to patch them up nice and smooth out that ceiling .ok , i 've laid out the tools that we 'll be using to address the ceiling situation .i 've got my tape , my joint compound and various shovels which i 'll be using to apply it with .i 've got a dust mask and a scraper .ok , the first thing we 're going to do is attack these cracks , give them a good scraping down .i want to get rid of all the chips and such that have formed up there .so , make sure you have a good dust mask. [CLS] [SEP]and you might even want to have a pair of goggles on hand .so i 'm just going to go up .so essentially what 's happened here is the ceiling is separated from the lass underneath and that 's why we 're getting these cracks .ok , that 's pretty good .ok , as you can see we created quite a mess here .paint chips everywhere .and the reason i did n't put a drop cloth down is because this is a lot easier way of cleaning up .if you put the drop cloth down , you 'll probably have a heck of a time trying to get all the chips off .so with a good hardwood floor like this , its just a matter of sweeping it up .if you have a vacuum , that will work too .you always want to keep your workspace as clean as possible .
the linear selection makes a smooth movement between keyframes but in a more linear fashion without the excess movement .the constant selection limits the animation to just each frame of motion .so , you 'll notice that when i select this , there is no movement whatsoever between keyframes ; it stops at one motion .so , what we 're going to do first of all is to select all the keyframes at the end of the walk , and we 're going to break that by having our figure stop completely .and now , as we scrub through the timeline , you 'll see that he walks and comes to a complete stop with no additional movement .
in this clip we 're going to talk about , how to project your singing voice .i have to say , this is a big subject .i would encourage you , if you really want to finesse this and really get it going to get some lessons .but in this clip , i can talk about a number of different things that will help you get started .one of which is , you want to sing with a relaxed open throat , that 's very important .if you close off , and a lot of beginning singers go , ( i 'm exaggerating ) but they sing with a lot of tension here , they 're nervous , they want to make sure they get the sound right , and that 's going to shut down the sound , it 's going to shorten it , limit it , shrink it , and it 's not going to be nearly as effective .you want to open everything up , you want to make sure the jaw is relaxed in the back , your throat is open as well .a great way to find what that feels like , is to force yourself to yawn , and when you yawn , everything goes , ahh , like that .so when you 're projecting your voice , you want to start from that thought .another thing that you want to think about , a friend of mine told me , that it 's almost like , controlled bellowing. [CLS] [SEP], i believe was the word , but , it might not have been ,but i like that word , and it means the same thing .so you might talk sort of like this , but make sure that this is all very open , and relaxed , because if you try to do that , it gets too strident .i also like to think of , like if i 'm in a big room. [CLS] [SEP], i like to think of a spot at the end of the room on the wall , like a little pin spot , and i want to make sure that my voice travels sharply to that , ( this is all just psychological stuff ) rather than try to make your voice go everywhere in the room , all at once .think of sending your voice to one very specific spot , and it travels like a laser beam , from a relaxed open throat to that place , and then everywhere else in the room , will also hear a nice clear ringing sound .and that 's a good way to start .and even if you 're not a singer , you can do the same , use some of these same techniques , as you talk , like if you were acting in a theatrical show , or something like that .so , i suggest you give those things a shot , and if you want to go further , find someone in your area who can help you with some regular singing lessons , to find more specific ways of going about that .this is tom kenaston , and this has been , how to project your voice .
next we 're going to learn the d minor scale .we 're only going to play the d minor scale in one octave .earlier we learned the d major scale .and a little later we 're going to learn the d minor arpeggio to go along with the d major arpeggio that we learned earlier .so this is the d minor scale .and now we are going to go down on the d minor scale .and you should be able to hear , it sounds slightly different from the d major scale .it has a slightly darker sound and this is mostly because you are playing in f natural as opposed to an f sharp , which you were playing earlier in the d major scale .and a little bit later we 're going to learn the d minor arpeggio to go along with the d minor scale that we just learned .
ok , floor bow .this pose happens in most beginning yoga classes , even though i personally believe that it is beyond the ability of most beginners .i 'm going to see if i can teach you how to do it safely and effectively and to work your way into it so that you do n't hurt yourself .floor bow is a back bend , you start on your belly .in this pose we 're going to grasp the ankles and the idea is to kick the feet back into the hands , lift the heart and rise into a bow shape .problem is , is that that 's nearly impossible for somebody who sits at a desk eight hours a day or more .this is the way i like to work into it .i like to bring one arm down to the floor. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm supporting myself on my forearm. [CLS] [SEP]and then the first thing i do is stretch the quad thusly , no big deal .the important thing here is that i 'm not sinking into my shoulder .i 'm staying lifted and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm trying to keep my shoulders squarish .so i 'm going to stretch both my quads before i move into my floor bow , and then while i 'm breathing. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm not holding my breath .shocker !and then i 'm going to do one leg at a time into my bow inhaling a couple breaths there and exhaling .inhaling , a couple breaths here , gently exhaling the leg down .then when i 'm feeling very open and very ready , i 'm going to inhale lifting both legs up .not letting the knees come out , keeping them together allowing the shoulder blades to be drug back in together , and allowing the heart to open .three to five breaths here exhale as you come down. [CLS] [SEP], do n't ever stop the breath .support yourself with the breath , and in the belly make sure your alignment is on , and when your done return to your belly , give yourself a little rest and prone shavasana .
now right now we 're going to talk about the drinks .if you serve your drinks in these fun little champagne type glasses your guests are sure to feel like the stars that they are .you can serve anything that you think your guests will enjoy from wine or champagne or just soda or sparkling cider , and even have some water on hand for those who may be , might be a little more on the boring side or healthy side , and just make sure that you do have a champagne glass for everyone on hand at the party , and enough champagne or sparkling cider for everyone to toast at the end of the awards show .you can also toast to the best picture once that 's announced and toast to you that you 're a great host and just toast the end of a great party , and just make sure that you have , if you 've had your guests rsvp that gives you a good head count of how much , how many cups and how many drinks you should have on hand , and if you do n't get any rsvp 's back just , you know , try calling your friends and see if they 're planning on coming because you do n't want to have a lot of left over things after your party .but if you do happen to have leftovers. [CLS] [SEP]it should n't be a big deal .you can return what you do n't use , or you can just host another party for the next awards show .
another thing that can be very important when we 're talking about giving criticism is asking for cooperation .and what i mean by this is saying to the person , hey , i 've got some pointers that i really want to give you .i see some real flaws here .i see some mistakes that could be deadly here .will you work with me. [CLS] [SEP]so i can help you on that .that is not such an in your face approach .if i 'm asking your permission to help you through criticism , sometimes that softens the blow of the criticism a little bit .because , o.k. [CLS] [SEP], i may not like this. [CLS] [SEP]but , yeah ,i 'm willing to hear what it is your have to say .i would like to have you work with me to make me better .because that 's what. [CLS] [SEP]we ultimately all want is to be good , and to be better , and to be constantly improving .and criticism helps us do that .so depending on who you 're dealing with ask for their cooperation to let them help you .
let 's understand the scrubbing process technically .scrubbing is an exfoliation process which removes the dead cells from the skin so that our skin breaths openly .in an acne prone skin , scrubbing process should ideally be avoided .we would now apply a little amount of mineral glow scrub .scrubbing has always been an important activity as a process of the facial .the scrub should be massage on the client 's face for about two minutes .we would be explaining the massage steps in the individual process of the facial in detail .we would this again from the client 's face .
chill to the bone is a powerful uncommon card out from coldsnap .it is an instant which means you can play it during and between phases of the game or at any phase of the game as long as you have the mana open .chill to the bone costs you 3 and a black which means its converted mana cost is 4 and. [CLS] [SEP]what it does is you destroy target nonsnow creature .once again , snow has been around and was in ice age and now in coldsnap , and there 's specific creatures that are snow creatures .once again , the environment now is not running snow creature. [CLS] [SEP]heavy. [CLS] [SEP]like it was. [CLS] [SEP]so this card can be very , very lethal because it gives you another destroy as in a terror or a creature destruction and no one will see it coming because people are not playing non-snow creatures .this card is still type 2 label because it is in the coldsnap expansion and basically for creature destruction deck , i would recommend this if you are running a blue-black control deck that is type 2 label right now .
i 've been keeping reptiles and amphibians for over forty years .and we 're here to talk about cleaning an iguana 's cage .if it 's a small aquarium , which you can start off with as a juvenile , it 's not difficult to just change out the bedding .you could use something like cypress mulch , which is not affected by a lot of misting and humidity , which is good for the iguana .and you can spot clean that .or you could even go something as simple as newspaper and just throw that away , and lay the new bed of newspaper down .you do n't need a lot on the floor of an iguana cage , because they 're arboreal , they spend most of their time up in the trees on branches .so you can put something very simple on the floor to allow you to clean it .now if you 're cleaning an outdoor cage , the main thing is to make sure the iguana ca n't get out while you 're cleaning .so hopefully , your outdoor cage is big enough for you to step into the cage , close the door behind you and then clean .
this is the basics of massage etiquette , sensitivity to the client 's mood regarding menstruation .obviously , this is an issue that applies to female clients .many experienced therapists know that it 's common for a female client to cancel a therapy session if they 're menstruating .one of the things that you can do to be sensitive to this is reassure the client that you 're prepared for the situation through any of the different. [CLS] [SEP]means that you can use to prepare .extra padding on the tables in case there 's an issue with any spotting that might occur or anything like that .from a therapeutic standpoint , obviously , there are many therapies , direct therapies and adjunct therapies , that can help relieve some of the issues that women experience from menstruation .those are therapeutic issues that you can take up with your client specifically and work towards a more fulfilling , more successful therapy session with that client .this is the basics of massage etiquette , sensitivity to the client 's mood during menstruation .
however , you have the opportunity even as the defender .suppose he has claimed diamonds , well he would not claim diamonds with your having that , supposing he has claimed hearts and you and your partner. [CLS] [SEP]are able to cough up 20 meld between you .let 's just say you happen to have 20 meld or 25 meld. [CLS] [SEP]and you have a chance to save that meld if you are able to pull counters .now that may not seem like much. [CLS] [SEP]but if they are able to roll out 60 points on you and you are able to save your 20 meld with 20 counters , you get 40 points. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's a nice constellation prize .you have n't lost the hand completely .by the way another small detail which i may have over looked , where 's the ten of diamonds when you need it ?here it is .let us say that he has named diamonds .let 's just take all of this away and say the opponent has named diamonds .he has called diamonds right ?you have the run in his suit and after all there is 20 diamonds in the deck and you and your partner may very well have these 5 and maybe an extra one .you get 15 meld here .you get the chance to claim the run in his suit .now in order to do that , you have to put it on the table to claim it .you have to put it on the table to claim it .you know , you do n't hide meld .i ca n't say to you bob. [CLS] [SEP], i 've got 12 meld. [CLS] [SEP]and i 've got 15 meld .okay mark us down for 25.it does n't work that way .if you are claiming meld , then the opponents has to see meld. [CLS] [SEP]and you have to claim aces .so there is no sneaky sucker feuds here about hiding meld. [CLS] [SEP]so if i 'm claiming this meld he is going to see i have it. [CLS] [SEP]and he has information about my hand .then again i 'm not going to walk away from 15 meld .do you have to claim meld ?no. [CLS] [SEP]but you should claim meld especially if you are trying to establish 20 points in that situation in meld .also in order to save meld during the play of the hand you have to gather up 20 counters and what are counters again ?aces , kings , and ten 's and two points for the last trick .
hello , my name is gabriela garzon , and i 'm an image consultant with g.g . [CLS] [SEP]image and etiquette consulting in coral gables , florida .in this clip , i 'm going to talk about how to choose summer tops that flatter your figure .basically , you need to know what type of figure you have .once you have that down , this is what you have to do .first thing , if you are a inverted triangle , meaning that you are wider here than in the bottom , you should wear these type of colors that are actually wide so they can give you balance in all your body .as you can see here , this has a wide collar , and it will give you a great balance and in soft fabric .white , of course , is a great choice for summer tops .if you have a more rounded figure where you need to kind of like hide those love handles but still look chic , you should wear very loose shirts ... [CLS] [SEP]back shirts .it 's better to stay with shirts than t-shirts , which they will give you a very bad form .this is another example for rounded figures .you see , it 's loose , but it 's still a dressy type of shirt , and it 's a great summer top .now , if you 're skinny , you can wear really nice things like this for summer .once again , this is gabriela garzon at g.g .image and etiquette consulting in coral gables , florida .
hello , this is jb .i 'm with austin homebrew supply in austin , texas .and we have been discussing ingredients , equipment , and process that would go into making beer or wine or cider at your own home .so , within this realm there 's a few different ways we can do this like a lot of things ,okay ?so what i want to discuss right now. [CLS] [SEP]is how do you cap a carboy ?okay , how do you how do you put a cap on the carboy ?well you got two options , okay ?one of which is the actual stopper itself .we call this a universal drilled stopper .it costs ninety-nine cents .you would take this guy and you simply put it into the top of the carboy like so .and you take your airlock .this is a three piece airlock .you put it into the stopper , like so .and now you effectively have made a one way valve that only allows co2 to exit without anything else getting in .okay , so this is what most folks are doing now a days .what i really want to show you here is this thing .this guy 's called a carboy cap , okay ?what this guy does is you can snap it down .instead of using your stopper here , use a carboy cap .and then what you would do you would put this. [CLS] [SEP]actually i got the little button on the wrong end .this would be stop .you would put this guy in here like that .and then you would fill this about a third full of water sanitizing solution allowing co2 to come out .well , why do you have this guy here ?well what 's nice about this is if you want to transfer liquid from this container to another , you can take this off .take this guy off .if you have a co2 system , you can hook it up here and put a hose off of this side. [CLS] [SEP]and you have another piece of tube that goes down into the carboy .if you pressurize it here , it forces pressure down on top of the liquid forcing it up that tube and out the other end .so , this guy here is called a carboy cap .and it 's one other way of sealing your carboy and allowing you maybe an option for transferring it from vessel a to vessel b .
the trick i am going to be walking you through now is the basic lip slide on the down slope rail .this trick varies a little bit in that you come from the other side of the rail and you swing your tails over as opposed to swinging your noses over. [CLS] [SEP]so if i were coming from this side i am going to hop 180 and swing my tails over like this. [CLS] [SEP]and it is going to put me in the exact slide position that i was in before. [CLS] [SEP]and i am going to come up and pop regular again and ride away. [CLS] [SEP]so it is going to be pretty much the same as soon as you get on the rail. [CLS] [SEP]so focus on bringing your tails up and over it .
and one important thing we want our centers to understand is not only to be moving within the offense , always flashing to the ball , making themselves available in the offense , but also one thing we want our centers to understand is , they have to know where the ball is at all times .we ca n't have a center that goes to sleep on us down in the post , and just says. [CLS] [SEP]well if they 're not going to feed it to me in the post , i 'm just going to stand here and watch the rest of the offense go on .they have to be an active part of the offense .they have to follow along with the ball as it moves around the perimeter .so what we 're going to do right now. [CLS] [SEP]is show you , and kind of walk through it , as the ball moves through the offense. [CLS] [SEP], we want you to see how the center 's going to work .so , obviously , if i 've got it here , he 's going to try to post it .if i decide not to throw it to him in the post , and i swing it , he 's going to flash up. [CLS] [SEP]and he 's going to follow the ball .now , as the ball then moves off to the other wing , he 's going to go ahead and trace it .now , as kyle goes ahead and dribbles it down , what zack 's going to do is he 's going to go ahead and post down on the block .and he 's just going to try to fight down and get to the lowest point in the offense .the main thing is , we want our centers to follow the ball , know where it 's at , and stay active in trying to get the ball in the offense .and that 's going to make your centers -- it 's going to separate the good centers from the not so good ones .
we 're going to present tadasana , mountain pose with the option of a chair .we 're going to start tadasana with the same alignment cues as any other time .you start with the soles of your feet aligning all the joints .so that if we have the inability to stand , you 're going to come and find yourself a chair , you 're still going to present your feet in tadasana .if you have shorter legs , then , for example jennifer , you might need to find yourself some blocks or possibly some books or something that you might have in your own home , so that you can lift and look at the alignment from the ankles to the knees , and then the knees to the hips , creating proper alignment .if i am not using the blocks , my knees , i start to angle down .we 're going to talk about from the hips to the shoulders , creates the length .lifting the head away from your shoulders , and allowing the shoulder blades , scapulus to glide down the spine .so the alignment is no different then when you are standing .we have a nice line from the ankle to the knee , knee to the hip , hip to the shoulders , out the crown of her head .she 's going to make an effort to lift the collar bone up towards her chin and as always an effort to create space in your spine .staying in tadasana for as long as it 's comfortable , with the thought of , `` where is there discomfort ?where do i need to make some adjustments '' ?and enjoy .
a great variation of the noseblunt slide , is the noseblunt side , the fakie .basically , what you 're doing is , what you 've ollied into the noseblunt slide ontop of the ledge , instead of popping out and rolling away forward , like you did with the noseblunt slide , you 'll want to pop out , one eighty , or ninety degrees the other way , and land fakie and roll away switch .this is another great variation that you can learn while doing noseblunt slides .one way to learn this , would be to do what you did with the noseblunt slide , and set up the board , and test popping out in the fakie position .from a stall , and practice popping out .the foot positioning that you 're going to need for the noseblunt slide , the fakie , is very similar to the pop out forward .the only difference is , you 're going to be guiding your shoulders just slightly differently to get you into a switch landing .now , this trick is harder to pop out in the middle of a ledge , it 's easier to come off the end of a ledge .but , you want to be able to learn it in the middle , because it 's a little harder to do in the middle .so if you learn it this way , you 'll be able to bring this trick to just about any spot , or any ledge .and that 's how you do a frontside noseblunt slide , the fakie .
now , i 'm going to show you how to make a curious comfort .this drink is going to be made in a highball glass .so first off , we 're going to fill the glass , right to the top , with ice .next , we 're going to add our liquors .in this drink , the two liquors are southern comfort , which is why it 's called a curious comfort .anytime you have the word comfort , you 're always going to use southern comfort , or soco .so , we 're going to add 3 , 3/4 of an ounce of southern comfort , and next , we 're going to add 3/4 of an ounce of blue curacao .then , we 're going to add our mixer , which for this drink is pineapple juice .and , we are going to mix it .so , i 'll just add it to my shaker .i 'm going to want to shake it up .and , you want to make sure there 's condensation on the side of the shaker. [CLS] [SEP], that 's how you know. [CLS] [SEP]it 's ready , and then you just fill the highball glass up .and , you 're going to add your stirrer .and , that is how you make a curious comfort .
alright ,now in making this wine , we 've got the fruit all busted up and inside your container that you 're going to let it digest in .now we have taken about , in making your mind ,wine , you want to take about a third of the fruit. [CLS] [SEP]and then you want to add in about a third of the sugar .so let 's say that you used three quarts of fruit , then you 'd want to put in three quarts of sugar .and here we 're using a raw pure cane sugar , which in making your wine , you want to make use the highest ingredients you have will give you the highest quality wine .so you would put the sugar in here. [CLS] [SEP]and then you would put three cups , three quarts of water in here. [CLS] [SEP]and you 'd want to use spring water or water that has been treated to take out all the chemicals and all the chlorine and such like that .so this would be called our digestive bucket here , and after you put all that in there , we 're going to stir this up and stir it up to get the sugar and the fruit and the water all mixed in. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's all nicely blended and mixed together real well .
you know , as important as defense is , you 've got to remember that you have options , you do n't have to use just one .one important defense that you can use is the one , three , one .hi , i 'm travis and. [CLS] [SEP]this is a one , three , one defense .when you 're setting up a one , three , one , first of all , you want to set it up where your point guard is at the top of the key , around this area .now , depending on how , depending on the offense that they 're playing and how effective that offense is , that will determine how far your point guard will go out .now , if the team that 's not really shooting a lot of jump shots and they 're not really hitting a lot of jump shots , and they 're really penetrating the paint , you might want to pack it in a little bit .your point guard might want to come down , and be inside here .once you get , but that 's , that point guards area , this is all of his area , his or her area .they 'll play anything up here , this is their spot .then you 'll have the three , which is your second defense , your three in the middle .so , you 'll have the point guard up top , you 'll have a forward right here , a center will be a little further back , but what you 'll have is , you 'll have a small forward here , you 'll have the shooting guard on the other side , to support the other side of the defense .so , you 'll have a small forward , power forward along the middle , and you 'll have the shooting guard on the other side .now , you may or may not want the outside players , the forward and the shooting guard to move up a little bit , that depends , on how you want to run it .but , that 's pretty much the premise , and each of those will have the responsibility of getting anything that comes in that paint .the forward actually , small forward will have this responsibility out here , anything beyond that point guards reach is , on this side of the court will be that small forwards responsibility .on the other side , same thing with the shooting guard , anything over there past the point guard will be that shooting guards responsibility .now , if it gets past this second line of defense , then back here you 'll have the center , which is again , the center will be the one that holds the paint down , and is in the middle , anything that gets past that line of defense , is his or her responsibility .there you have it a one , three , one defense .
see how well your system performs and this is more of a bragging thing. [CLS] [SEP]you know you go up to someone and go. [CLS] [SEP]hey. [CLS] [SEP]my system scored this much is better then yours .this is purely a bragging thing and it will give you a idea how well your computer performs with your new install video card .you could do this with your video card you had before to see how much of a difference .so i would actually say if you are going to up grade. [CLS] [SEP]your video card download. [CLS] [SEP]this program its free .run it .write down the number , install your new card , run it , write down the number and that would give you a very concrete proof on how much a difference the upgrade made .so what you do you could get the free program of the website called futuremark.com it is spelled just the way it sounds .future and mark to spaces nothing dot com .then once you have there page you click on products .once you click on products right here pc bench marks .they got they release programs every so often. [CLS] [SEP]so we got 2006 , 2005 , 2003 in pc mark .this is are different test. [CLS] [SEP]you just pick 2005 just for kicks .then just scroll down to the one that says 3-d mark five free unlimited version .you just click here and download it .run the program and it would run like it is really cool. [CLS] [SEP]3-d rendering video and. [CLS] [SEP]at the end it going to give you a number .another program that you could download is called aqua mark .you need to go to google.com , type aqua mark which is. [CLS] [SEP]aqua mark one word something .click enter .the first result you just click enter , and you get to this website called the google of 3-d.right here you just click right there and download it .the test are pretty cool , they are pretty accurate .it would give you good idea on how good your upgrade did .it is a good thing if you are a gamer or if you are doing 3-d video or cad of any sort to see how much better your performance is with your new card .
so , here in head balance spine is upside down balancing .rising up through the seat .rising up through the feet .head is rooting down .you 're going to come from this pose back to hero pose .turn everything topsy-turvy .bang .and , i feel it 's important to take this pose after head balance .because , it tells you what you actually did .hard to believe that in head balance the experience is of elongation of weightlessness of lightness .and , people tell you that. [CLS] [SEP]and if you have n't experienced it you do n't believe it .but , when you come upright in this pose you 'll get to feel .do i feel taller ?do i feel aligned ?do i feel off ?and , contracted and so forth .so , this pose is going to tell you what you just did .and , gradually it 's going to improve .from here , we turn the toes under .and , we 've got kind of a freebie here. [CLS] [SEP]we just get to hang out .yet more , so if there is a chance maybe that you did get a little bit of compression in the neck or the upper back. [CLS] [SEP]you can let it go here .uttanasana standing forward bend .
today we 're going to talk about trimming your goat 's hooves .now , it 's a gnarly and dangerous job , but it 's an important one , nonetheless .the winter is really tough on goat 's feet , and they tend to crack and split , and the manure and the mud gets rammed up into the hoof .and so , regular maintenance of the goat 's hooves is important .these goats have been a little bit neglected , but we 'll do our best to bring the hoof back into shape , and then continue through the spring to trim it back .let me show you how it 's done .okay .the goat is contained in this stance , and so i have full access to the goat 's hoof .and what i 'm trying to do is create a flat plane which corresponds to this hairline here .so i 'm trying to reproduce this hairline along this surface .you can see , there 's broken hoof here , we want to trim that off .and we want to take out the tip .easy , boy .fight .no , baby .hang in there .it has to be done , so , may as well do it .this is called the frog , we want to trim that back as well , to a flat surface here , and you want to recreate that flat surface as best we can .you see there 's dead tissue , there 's mud. [CLS] [SEP], there 's manure there , but we 're trimming back and recreating , as best we can , that flat surface .as i said , it 's a difficult job .
all right , now we 're going to go ahead , and make our rice , so we 're going to turn on our front burner , to about six , and then we 're going to put in about a tablespoon of oil , and we 're going to move that around , so it coats the bottom of the pan. [CLS] [SEP].i 'm going to measure out a cup of rice , and i always like to pour whatever i 'm measuring out into , or over what i 'm doing , so if anything spills , like this is doing .then , it 's going straight into what we 're going to put it in , anyway , so we put one cup of rice , and you generally want to do , a two to one , rice to liquid ratio .we still have some rice in here , so we 're going to go ahead , and measure out two cups of water , like that .normally , we would be adding garlic or salt and pepper , some sort of spices , but what we really want , is for this rice to be plain , because we 're going to be adding a lot of seasonings , cottage cheese , and eggs , later on , so what we 're going to do , is we 're going to take this rice , stir it up , and we 're going to bring it to a boil , and then , once it does come to a boil , we 're going to put our lid on , turn our heat down .we 're going to let it cook for about fifteen minutes , or until all the liquid has absorbed .
one of the very next things we do after singing the alphabet song is the alphabet sounds chant and the kids love this .sometimes even more than the alphabet song. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's a great routine. [CLS] [SEP], you can do it as many times , but make sure you start out doing it each time you tutor or home school .and we will start with the a and go all the way through .as we go through it and as you do it day after day and the children start learning the sounds , they 're going to say hey , how about i use , instead of using this for this letter , how about i use a different word and that 's great. [CLS] [SEP], let them be creative , as long as it fits , let them change this. [CLS] [SEP]or you can switch it up and say we 're not going to use cat today. [CLS] [SEP], we 're going to use cole slaw or something else that starts with a c but have fun with it. [CLS] [SEP]and it is fun and you 'll find that your child loves it .so here we 'll start , ready , and go ... [CLS] [SEP]..a aaa apple , b buh ball , c cuh cat , d duh dog ,e eh elephant. [CLS] [SEP], f fff frog , g guh goat , h ha hat ,i ii igloo , j juh jump , k kuh kitten , l. [CLS] [SEP]ll light ,m mmm man , n nnn not , o. [CLS] [SEP]oh octopus , p puh pepper , q quh. [CLS] [SEP], now q does n't have a quh sound unless there 's a u. [CLS] [SEP]but it almost always does so just teach them it that way , q quh queen , r rrr rabbit , s sss sun , t tuh telephone , u uh umbrella , v vuh victor , w wuh water x ex , now x is never in the beginning of a word with the sound that it usually uses so. [CLS] [SEP]x is the only one that goes at the end , x foxx. [CLS] [SEP]and i teach. [CLS] [SEP]x , the sound sounds like ice breaking. [CLS] [SEP], that 's what i tell the children , practice , so x fox , y yuh , yellow , z zuh zebra. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's it .
if it 's coming for your married life , that means that there can be a fight in your married life , everything 's going smooth and all of a sudden you get into a dispute and aros is but warfares .at the same time if it 's coming for your finances , there can be some kind of agression which leads to a no .there can be problems because you are going to be fighting and fighting your odd , the finances just too important. [CLS] [SEP]but you will say no for them .so if it 's coming for any segment of life , it 's going to be saying no , but through aggression , that means a fight is but too obvious , you ca n't avoid it .
now one neat little trick that i use sometimes , especially when i 'm printing with a fiber based paper , are the times in which i develop my print at .now there are different times for rc paper and for fiber paper .that 's one way that the fiber based paper is a little bit slower to work with .but i sort of like it because i can develop my fiber based paper anywhere from two to five minutes .and therefore i can sort of manipulate the way that print looks .i can manipulate it much easier than i can manipulate my rc print .and another thing that i can do with the fiber based paper , is i can use two developers .i can use a dectol and a selectol .the dectol 's are a cold , contrasty developer , and the selectol 's a very warm developer .so in a way , i 'm getting the best of both worlds using those two different developers .now it is more expensive to use two different developers , but sometimes price is definitely worth what your final outcome of your print is .
after this point , we 're going to have to put it in the refrigerator and let it sit for at least one hour .a good idea is to go ahead and cook this ahead of time the day before so it can be sitting over night , so it 'll have time to sit and rest because we do n't want the mix to go straight from the mixer to the cookie tray .it wo n't turn out good cookies .they wo n't stick together .at this point , it 's letting all the flavors mix in and set .like any other meal you do , the longer it sets , the better it is .think of this as slow roasting for a cookie .
alright when closing down a pool. [CLS] [SEP]it 's a good idea to definitely keep a good level of any chemical that you have in there already .you maintain good level of chlorine always , whether summer or winter time .one of the chemicals that i like a lot is going to be the pool magic phosfree spring and fall .what this does is. [CLS] [SEP]this entire quart is added to the water when the season is over , like probably more towards , for our season in california , more like october , end of september , october .and what this is going to be doing for you. [CLS] [SEP]is this is going to be breaking down any thing organic that 's going to be contributing to any type of algae .mainly phosphates , this is going to be lowering the phosphate level in the pool if you have one .what phosphates are , that 's what algae eat or feed on to grow .so if we can eliminate any type of phosphate out of the water , we can be eliminating any type of algae or bacteria starting to grow .that 's mainly the thing that we stress on in our industry and in california our region is going to be limiting phosphates that we do n't have a problem with algae .whether it 's winter time or summer time .
so as i 'm working with all the colors ; the black , white , and the brown , the orange , i 'm wanting to create this effect of fur , so i want all the colors to start to blend in with each other .so i 'm using this old brush .and as i start to create the brush strokes of the tigers markings , then the black gets merged in with the brown and the orange and the white , more of a three dimensional effect of the fur .
today i 'm going to tell you about a game that you and two of your friends can play , so that one of you does n't have to sit out while the other one plays , such as you would have to do in eight ball .the name of the game is cut throat .and what you do is one person will break the balls .one , the person who breaks the balls has one through five .the person who shoots second has six through ten .and the person who shoots third has eleven through fifteen .the object of the game is to get your playing partners balls off of the table and have at least one of yours left .you can shoot any ball .you can shoot your ball into the hole to get a better shot on somebody else 's ball .you continue shooting until you miss .when that has happened , then the next man comes up to the table and he starts to shoot .so the whole purpose is to try to get your friends balls off the table before yours are .
backstroke is basically the upside down version of your freestyle stroke .the only difference or the primary difference is that you 're allowed to breath as often and as regular as you like , so it makes it almost more comfortable for swimmers .the first thing you 're going to want to do is learn how to float on your back by simply placing your head back , your chin up in the air , putting your belly button up and just letting your body float naturally .take breaths in nice and easy .a tendency that people have is that they stop breathing .basically they just fill themselves up afraid to allow any water in their mouths or in their nose .but please , keep on breathing whenever you 're floating on your back .the next phase is just incorporating your straight leg , pointed toe kick .you 're just going to keep your hips up on top of the water with your pelvic bone up at the top. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 're just going to kick with that nice , small , fast , straight leg , pointed toe kick .once you have your kick down , you float and you feel comfortable in the water , you can incorporate the pull or the stroke motion of the back stroke which is basically going to be a thumbs out , twisting your hand , pinkie in , bending that elbow by catching the water underwater and pushing it all the way through .so again , that 's going to be a thumbs out of the water , pinkie into the water ,bend that elbow under catching and pushing all the way through down to your hips .and it 's going to be one hand at a time .you do n't want to move both hands at the same time .it 's going to be one hand at a time .something to the effect of this .one arm pushes as the other one 's coming back down your hips. [CLS] [SEP], the other one starts the stroke and then you can pick up the speed as fast or as slow as you like .whatever is most comfortable .to learn more about back stroke , please contact your local swimming expert .
the first place i think of going is to music .a lot of artists i know do work to music. [CLS] [SEP]but this is really about focusing on the music and letting it guide your mark making rather than just having it as background sound .so i 'm going to work you know , with a fluid medium again although i might decide that i need something choppier as well .so i 've got a charcoal stick here too. [CLS] [SEP]and i 've got some , a bach brandenburg concerto playing in the background. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm just going to start thinking about how i feel and how i 'm going to transfer that sound onto a piece of paper .so what i 'm hearing right now is you 've got. [CLS] [SEP]that sort of beat that sort of marches through the whole thing so that might look like this .and then you 've got these very light sounds and to me those sound small .so that 's going to be small and. [CLS] [SEP]then underneath it. [CLS] [SEP]i kind of have like the. [CLS] [SEP], i do n't know if it 's the harmonium or. [CLS] [SEP]whatever it is. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's something that sort of continues in , in sort of underneath everything else .and that 's going to be some sort of continuous line .now i might actually like this. [CLS] [SEP]broken because it 's not so heavy. [CLS] [SEP]and so it is that sort of , it stays in the background .you know it still , what else do we have ?we have that , i still do n't have that sort of quickness yet. [CLS] [SEP]so i 've got to find a quickness. [CLS] [SEP]and maybe i need to do diagonals .and really move quick and sort of flick and is that my music ?i do n't think it matters what music you use. [CLS] [SEP]it 's anything that you prefer. [CLS] [SEP]but it just gives you a break from everything. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're concentrating not really on visuals but just on connecting two of your senses .and that might open up a whole new world for you , just starting to bring another sense into the visual .
next we continue with using our elbows as a punch .so to do that we have a nice stable base of either a a stance or a sumo stance .toes are out , lots of flexibility , mobility through the base of the body .bringing it into the core right here .and then what you simply do is you have an open hand and a fist .and you punch that elbow out , bring it back to center , punch , center , punch , center , punch , center .we will try the other side by opening the other hand , fist on the other side .punch , like nudging it with your elbow , punch , elbow punch , punch , punch , pop .you can do it one side and the other , pop , pop , to play with the agility , the ability to change quickly , precisely .elbow punch .
we are going to go over the last basic measurement on how to , on the measurements to have a custom dress made .the last measurement is the arm circumference .and we want to take this to make sure , especially if you 're having a poofy sleeve or , or even just a basic sleeve that we get a sleeve that , that fits your arm .and is n't too big or too tight .if it is too tight around your arm , you 're not going to be able to move .so the best thing to do is just to , to take your soft measuring tape that you 've been using , and go around the upper part of your tricep , and do n't pull it too tight .make sure it 's just snug .and line up the end with the front like we 've been doing .and this will give you the proper measurements .one other thing that you can do too , is go ahead and measure from where the top of the shoulder is down to see exactly how long you want the sleeve and then take the measurement from that point and go around .
i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]an actor , singer , musician based out of new york and miami .in this clip we 're going to talk about how to play guitar in the key of d. [CLS] [SEP]now. [CLS] [SEP]this is a d chord and in the key of d , that would be the root chord .so we can start with the d chord .it can also be played in this position .but for this video , we 're going to stay in the open position .the chords involved in the key of d would be d obviously as the root , g which is the four of the one , four , five pattern , which is d , g , a. [CLS] [SEP]it would sound a little bit like this .so again you 've got your root chord or the one which is a d chord , the four which is a g and the five which is an a.so those are the chords that work together in the key of d. [CLS] [SEP]and my name is steve anthony .this has been how to play guitar in the key of d .
and we can see that there are several turrets in here .so one thing that we can do to get rid of them instead of rushing them with a block because there 's too many of them , we can place a portal under the different turrets and let them fall through , or we can place one behind and walk up and grab it like we 've been doing .and the turrets come through the portals just like any other object so you can reach in and grab one and then pull it and take it somewhere else .we 've got a couple of more to deal with here .so we can maybe place a portal above that one and drop a block on it , if we can aim that .go ahead and knock that one down , and that clears this room from turrets .we can pick up the box , put it on the pressure plate , and it looks like it 's not quite the exit yet .we 've got a couple more turrets to deal with , but there 's this wire mesh here that i ca n't walk through .luckily , you can shoot a portal through the wire mesh and you can put the entrance just anywhere. [CLS] [SEP]and you 'll come out behind the turret .you can knock it down .and we want to come out behind this one as well so be careful to place the portal somewhere where you can approach the turret from the side or the back .come through , pick it up , set it in the corner , and there 's test chamber 16 .
until our strands of cheese are all melted .we can take that and place it right here in the back .then we are going to come back into the oven and grab our vegetables .you can see that the cheese has just started to get a little brown .squeeze our entire vegetable thing straight into the back .then we are going to come back to our pork .i 'm going to pull our pork off and lay that over the front .then we are going to stir our veggies up here to the front .make sure we get a nice blend of the bacon , the tomatoes , the onions , and the jalapenos .spread that over the top .then we 'll take a little scoop of our cream sauce , take our scallions , place those over the front .here we have our asparagus , caramelized onions , red peppers , basil and reggiano cheese , our green chili , cheddar mashed potatoes , and our tomato , bacon , lime , jalapeno , pork chop .
a lot of the principles work both whether you 're in a bar or in a church .one of the important things , not only listening or playing less , less is more , but is let the music breathe .do n't be afraid to have some spaces in the song .a lot of times , if i 'm playing for instance , this song , `` enough '' , i may be playing something light on the strings -- or maybe the next verse , i just stop playing .i let the guitars carry it .a lot of times , it 's nice to start a chorus with just a guitar or one instrument .maybe you 're the one instrument playing but do n't be afraid to stop playing .you do n't have to play every chorus , every verse , every note .let the music breathe .put some space in there .or maybe what you do is just come in at the beginning of a phrase .for example , if i 've got -- especially with some of the sounds that ring .if i wanted to play `` enough '' with a bell , i might just do this or something like that .in other words , at the beginning of the phrase , play something and then just let it ring. [CLS] [SEP]and then just come in on the first bar of each phrase .so , do n't be afraid to let the music breathe .
now that we have got our clay up there and we are ready to roll. [CLS] [SEP]you want to go ahead and clean your hands off a bit. [CLS] [SEP], get that slip off , we do n't need it any more really. [CLS] [SEP]and i have saved some over here for when we need to do it again .clean up , alright .you want to establish the bottom of the moquette and then do that little tiny karate chop on top to make it nice and flat. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to find the center of the top there. [CLS] [SEP]and once you find the center you can start to plunge and once you find the center you want to go down with just one thumb because these are small pots you do n't have to go down with two , establish your hole and from there you want to even up the top and make sure that your hole and your bottom are lined up and now we are ready to establish the bottom of the moquette .
so , let 's find the flour , ok.i pour it in into the bowl , ok , and then we need about two hundred grams of sugar , but you can actually put less or more , depending on your taste .that 's a bit too much ; put some back , that will do it .i pour it together with the flour .now i 'm going to put some baking soda in it .well , i use about one coffee spoon of baking soda , ok , and a tiny little bit of salt , some cinnamon .i mean , you can provide those spices according to your taste .we love cinnamon , so i put quite a lot in it .then i 'm also going to put some mixture that is especially made for gingerbread men .i put in about two spoonful of this mixture , ok.maybe i can put a little bit of chocolate , dry chocolate , just to give a little hint of chocolate taste , okay .
the next step wants you to take a look and see at the design element .one of the things that you need to do is , on this one , is carry these , the blue color a little further out .we have the dimensions to do that .we can add that by a simple flower , or small filler that does n't really take away from the cow lilly , but it adds a little dimension to it and it takes your eye out .and we can do that on both sides , so that you 'll follow all the way through .the next , the other thing you need to do at this point , is lift it up .and again , i use a hot glue gun .and start to glue in , now you can hold it anywhere and see where it is , and hold in any of those pieces that hand downward , just run the glue in there until they stay in place .it 's very important because this might be an arrangement that you are going to be taking on and off the table and you do n't want it to be falling apart every time you go to pick it up .so the next piece , the next step in making an arrangement is making sure that your design elements work .if they need something , go ahead and make that adjustment to them .and then go ahead and glue everything in space .
and we 're just going to do a few little cross-hatches down at the bottom , and then we 're going to add some glue .we are very carefully going to go around our mushroom stem .and this grass is optional .you do n't have to do this .the mushroom will look fine without it .i think it 's a nice touch .and you can take some of the pieces and you can curl them forward , twist them around , make them a little interesting .
okay , so you went under three that first time , but you may have to do that when you get to the beginning , but then you go back to your two .so you keep going around and around here .hopefully things are pretty clear now .you do n't want to over-tighten at this point , because it 's going to be hard to check the sound , because you ...this ... [CLS] [SEP]this skin still has hair .so pretty soon we 're going to stop here , and get into shaving the head .if you get ...if your drum in still loose , if these are still really loose , then you might want to go back ...you might want to tighten a little more , and then go back and take out the horizontal lacing , and go back and tighten the vertical again .which might seem like a lot of work , but , and it is a lot of work , but , you wo n't be able to get up all the way. [CLS] [SEP]and you ...you 're head wo n't be tight .so if your ... [CLS] [SEP]if your knots are n't flipping over on each other , they 're probably not that tight .
hey my name is addison from captain bills. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to tell you how to buy an outdoor volleyball net .if you are very serious about playing outdoor volleyball you would want to get a very durable net .one that will last you awhile , those you can not find in any sporting good stores .you are going to have to go online ,a lot of places in florida or in california have very durable nets , outdoor volleyball nets that can be used on a day to day basis .if you are not serious and just use it for recreational use you can find one a pretty decent one at a sporting good store .it may not last you as long. [CLS] [SEP]but if you are not using it everyday it would be a perfect fit for just the recreational use .so when going to a sporting good store a lot of times you 'll find there 's badminton and volleyball packages and there are combination packages .those may not be regulation , so one thing you can do is look online and if under the volleyball net that you are looking for it says avp quality or avp certified .avp is the association of volleyball professionals .so that is what the professional volleyball players use .so if you find a net that says avp quality or avp certified that 's going to be the most durable net to use when playing outdoor volleyball .another thing you need to look for is who you are buying it for .if you are buying it for men 's , you are going to need to have a certain height for the net .the men 's height is seven feet eleven inches .and the women 's height is seven feet four inches .women 's height can also be used for juniors or kids .also the width and the length of the volleyball court is thirty feet by sixty feet. [CLS] [SEP]so you want to make sure that you get lines that fulfill those requirements for the volleyball net .volleyball lines. [CLS] [SEP]and that is how to buy a volleyball net .
today , we 're here to talk about selecting goggles for skiing or snowboarding .i think goggles are much more appropriate than sunglasses for these activities .they 're protect your eyes from glare off of the snow , coming from the bottom up .they also protect against wind , which sunglasses do n't do that well .and also , actually , if you fall on your face , the goggles ' a little more protective than sunglasses .when you 're looking at goggles , you 'll see some basic models here , that just have a wrap around lens like this .this is a double lens , they 're actually two lenses , like a thermal window , and that keeps fog out from happening .there is also an anti-fog bonded to the lens , and any of your more popular brands of goggles will have all those features .then when you step up into a more higher end model , you 'll see there 's a spherical curve to the lens , which gives you less peripheral , visual distortion , truer looks , or truer views there .and , there are different lenses available , any thing from a clear , which would be used for night riding or very darker times in the evenings .or , it for , the most near darkest , for the brightest days out there .there 's also junior models available .these are obviously smaller , still have all the same features , and what you 're going to look for when you 're actually trying goggles on , is something that just fits well , all around your face , no gaps around your nose , or anywhere else .and they do come in some different shapes , so trying on goggles is the best way to go .when you 're wearing these with a helmet , pretty much all helmets have some form of a goggle strap retaining device here , and that 's just. [CLS] [SEP]so the goggle strap does n't slip around on the helmet .so , they , they work real great with helmets also .and , that 's what you should look for when you 're shopping for goggles for skiing or snowboarding .
just bring his knee up into his chest .he 's going to take his arms out to the sides in a t. [CLS] [SEP]good .he 's going to bring his knee across his chest and over to the side .now as a partner , your job is to keep your partner 's shoulder leveled .and the first thing i 'm going to do is get familiar with his breath so that i can move with his breath .i 'm going to ask him to inhale in and as he exhales , i 'm just going to give gentle pressure to his shoulder and pull his hip long to lengthen out through that side body .on his next inhale i 'm going to release and then on his exhale. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to press his hip over .and be sure to ask your partner when to stop .so you tell me when .keep going , keep going , it feels really good .so then again moving with your partner 's breath inhaling and exhaling .you might find each time he exhales he 's able to come into it just a little bit deeper as he opens up through his side body just a little bit more .again this is a really delicious pose , it feels really good .
you need to go clean off your wheel head , save this , it 's good clay , nice and dry , it 's a nice center there , find the center. [CLS] [SEP], that 's not it , there it is , close enough .alright , so this technique throwing off of the hump will save you time , especially for this kind of stuff .it 's a good technique to know. [CLS] [SEP]and we do n't have to worry about centering the bottom here right yet , because we 're just going to be using this massive clay on the top .so do a little wheel wedge , bring it in , some more wheel wedging , press it down , press it in .alright , now that we got it centered up here , we want to establish how much clay we 're going to use to. [CLS] [SEP]about right there .from here , i 'll show you how to make little candlestick holders off of this hump here .
i 'll some demonstrations of some basic techniques and an overview of katas , sparring all the different facets of the martial art. [CLS] [SEP]and i will also. [CLS] [SEP]so a bit of weapons or `` kobudo '' .so now i want to talk about the history of karate , now there are alot of different theories as to where to martial arts came from .all of them are probably equally valid but the one theory is that martial arts actually originated in ancient greece .there is this form. [CLS] [SEP]if greek wrestling called , pankration , and it included , punching , kicking , grappling , it looked like today 's ufc fights or ultimate fighting .from there the ancient greek sailors traveled around the world , they became in contact with the asians , chinese , and the indonesians and the thai 's and that 's where the chinese picked it up .from there the chinese really evolved marital arts into this advanced system that people called , kung fu .but there is actually literally hundreds maybe even thousands of different variations of kung fu or wu shu , as they call it in china martial arts .the chinese sailors they started to do trade with the okinawa , the small island that is south of japan , and that is where they came in contact with the okinawans .now there was one chinese sailor , he was a military leader that actually traveled to okinawa , his name was ko soku , and he came and did alot of trade with the okinawans , and showed them alot of techinques or what they called , tru anfa , or long fist boxing , or as like kenpo , law of the fist was the literal translation for that .the okinawans saw these real advanced chinese techniques , and the thing is with chinese techniques , if you have ever seen kung fu its very long stances , very extended flowery circular motions , and stuff like that .the okinawans they are kind of like very simple minded , they lived in kind of beach terrain they did n't want to try that kind of stuff because it 's dangerous for your footwork you might slip .so they adapted it to their own localized fighting style , which was just wrestling and throwing eachother around and stuff .
alright , so where the cheeks come into the rest of the face , usually as people get older there is a line that is going to go kind of from the nose down around the mouth .our reference is young but as he gets older , there is going to be a more defined shadow that is going to appear here .the more shadows you add to a face , the younger it looks , because usually those defined wrinkles in the skin where the light is being captured .that is kind of where shadows are coming from .in this reference , it is all very smooth .there are not that many wrinkles , that many places where shadows are being created .so , let us back at the face .it looks pretty smooth .got shadows going on here .this one is actually a little too much for our reference , he makes him look older than he is. [CLS] [SEP]so we are going to cover that up a little bit .that is good .let us deepen this one a little bit .by using a more condensed color we can , adding the blue and the red and making it a dark color , we can deepen the shadow here .so , you can see .ok .
alright , now i want to talk about one other thing about your greeting .as far as your speaking voice , same principals to all other business conversations ; be professional , do n't speak to fast ; have a smile in your voice , be positive and helpful ; articulate so that people can understand you .another thing that you want to do is make sure you leave your , you make your greeting current .if you , if you 're out a lot ; if you have different instructions for your callers a lot , make sure you change that greeting a lot .the worst thing for me to do today , march 18th is to call up and your greeting says `` hello , this is tracy goodwin today. [CLS] [SEP]is february 23rd. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'll be out of the office today '' ;ok but where are you march 18th ?i need to talk to you now , alright .no instructions , i have no idea what 's going on ; that 's very unprofessional .and that last and most important thing to do know matter how difficult it is. [CLS] [SEP]; respond to those messages promptly .`` oh yeah bob , i got your message two weeks ago and ; and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm calling you back , ok. [CLS] [SEP]''really 72 hour max turn around on responding to those phone messages .and if you follow those tips , you 're going to have a great great greeting .
in this segment , we re going to talk about the parts of the piano .in front of me are the keys all types of keys white keys and black keys .down here we have the low keys .these are low notes -- so it s down the keyboard .all the way up here we ve got the high notes making high sounds , high tones .these are the high notes and of course the notes in the middle .as you can see , there are white keys and there are black keys .now , how does a piano work ?if i open the lid of the piano , you ll see that each one of these keys attaches to a string. [CLS] [SEP]i mean to a hammer. [CLS] [SEP]and if i play the key , it makes the hammer hit the string and that s exactly how a piano works .now down here , these are pedals .on the right is the sustain pedal .if i play a note and hold the sustain , it holds the note even without me holding my hand .if i play the left pedal , it makes the note softer .
this is a power race. [CLS] [SEP]so you want to run with pure power , speed .at the same time , while you 're doing that , you wan na , like i say again , you want to always want to relaxed , and efficiently , and coordinately .so you always going to learn to drive , stride , and lift .these are the three most important things in any sprint event .drive down 100 meters , lift , continue lifting your legs , lifting your knees , and stride .you want to stride at 100 meters completely .
hi , i 'm james , with j & c home repair .today i 'm going to show you how to buy a rotary tool as a gift .really , there 's really no difference between rotary tools. [CLS] [SEP], they 're all basically all the same .the only difference in it is the type of attachments that come with it .there 's polishing attachments , there 's stuff that you can do sanding with. [CLS] [SEP], they 've got little attachments that you can do cutting with , a grinding disc , little flapper wheels .there 's all different types of things for sanding , polishing , cutting , shaping , molding. [CLS] [SEP], it just depends on what kind of hobbies or whatever purposes whoever you 're buying the gift for prefers to do .they have them where they just come with the basic rotary tool with just a couple of attachments , and then they have these gift sets that come out. [CLS] [SEP]and they 've got a hundred different pieces that you can attach to your rotary tool .and those are a nice thing to give as a gift because it gives you a lot of options as far as what they can do with it .as far as just the rotary tool , though , they 're basically all the same .some of them are a little bit more powerful than the other ones , and will handle a little heavier work load .but just try to know a little something about who you 're buying the gift for and then just base that , what you 're buying the tool for. [CLS] [SEP], just base your information on that on what to give him .
you 're going to want to keep some supplies on hand until , until right , you know , when you 're leaving the house until everything has been taken out of your house .we already talked about keeping your toolbox readily available , and , and also your cleaning supplies , you want to keep those readily available .some other good supplies to keep available are tape , and your , your marker , some plastic bags , any kind of rope that you 're going to be using , that you have maybe to pack things in the truck .any kind of moving pads , furniture pads , towels , blankets that you might want to use for padding things that your packing into the truck .so these are things that you , you 're just want to , you 're going to want to keep out until you ’ re ready to leave the old place. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're ,you 're not coming back .and maybe , keep , keep an extra bag or an extra box , open so that you can just put all of those things in that bag or that box , and put them in the car because you 'll also need those once you get to your new place .so it would be nice to have all of those things in one box or one bag .
we 'll make this a happy birthday !and i 'm going to add a little bit more of the stickers to really decorate the card nicely .the sticker collections now a days are so fancy .you do n't have to have really any artistic ability except to know what you like .and you can see you put together a very fancy card .and you can personalize it any way you like .i 'll add a few more things here .never be afraid to cut up the stickers and make them do what you want them to do .it 's nice to secure the pop up cards with a little bit of double stick tape or a dab of glue , just on the corners here .just to hold that together .and just stick that down on the corners .and there 's our super easy pop up card .you have a nice pop up like that. [CLS] [SEP]and it can be personalized .i have a message here , a special birthday spell for you .
so we 're going to add an entire pound of cream cheese .and you want to make sure that both the butter and cream cheese have been taken out well in advance so that they are nice and soft and easy to beat together .this is going to be a really fast frosting to make provided that all the ingredients are ready .as soon as we get this cream cheese in here , then we 'll be ready to start beating it .of course , if you let things get too soft , then they do n't want to come out their packaging .so , with the cream cheese and softened butter in the mixer , we 're going to start it on a slower speed .and then we 're going to increase the speed up to a much faster speed so they can both be fully incorporated and creamed before we go on to our next step .
so whatever you have on your hair already , you have to take into consideration , whether it 's your natural color or whether it 's color that you put on previously , and you have to take that into consideration always when choosing your next hair color .on this mannequin , we 've got some highlighted pieces , and then we 've got some colored pieces .so if i was to apply let 's say a red color all over , i would have to take into consideration this blonde hair .this blonde hair may very well turn pink .so in order for me to make this a nice red , i would have to apply something else over it before applying the final color .in the next few segments we 're going to be talking about how to choose those colors and how to properly do that .
today i 'm going to show you how to replace your chain rings .first step is to remove the crank set from your bike .this requires a special tool which if you do n't have this tool you need to take it in to your local bike shop and have them remove it for you .once you get it to this point where it 's off of the bike you can then proceed with removing the chain rings .most chain rings are held together with chain ring bolts .there 's either four or five of them .they usually , typically have a 5 millimeter or a 6 millimeter allen screw in them .so you just need an allen wrench to remove them .start with , on this particular case , the triple .you can start with the inner ring .i 'm just going to loosen these screws all the way around the outside .now that you have your inner ring removed you can proceed with removing the outer and the middle rings which are held together with a two sided bolt .usually you can get them off with just one side .same process .just loosen them .and on these ones you have to hold the back of them to unscrew the two pieces .and they 'll come apart in two halves .now that you have all of those out both rings should be free from the spider and you can then replace whichever ring needs to be replaced .to reinstall them. [CLS] [SEP]it 's basically the opposite of the uninstallation .however you do have to make sure the rings are lined up in the proper orientation to their location on the spider .the outer ring will usually have a peg which goes behind the crank arm .and the middle ring will typically have a little tab as well which goes behind the crank arm .and the middle ring is going to be kind of one sided .it should be labeled .the labeling should face towards the inside .and you can see on this particular one. [CLS] [SEP]there 's a little tab right there next to the label .so that will go behind the crank arm as well .then take the two halves .you want to apply grease .which these particular ones are already greased but definitely make sure you grease the threads , and proceed to torque them back down .you begin replacing the bolts , torque the bolts down to the proper torque spec and at that point you can replace the crank back on you bike .you should be ready to run .and that 's how you replace your chain rings .
alright , now we 're mixing it up even more , for you .so now what we 're going to do , is we 're going to be doing the one. [CLS] [SEP]and then the. [CLS] [SEP]and of four .alright ?so , it 's going to be like one , two , three , four .one , two , three , four .and one , two , three , four .and one , two .alright ?so here we go .so , one and then the. [CLS] [SEP]and of four .alright ?so here we go .two and four on hi hat , ride cymbal swinging away .one .one , two , three , four .and one , two , three , four .and one , two , three , four .and one , two , three , four .and one , two , three , four .and one , two , three , four .and one , two , three , four .there you go .
a single thread would be like this you just have one thread , which on a more delicate piece you 'd probably want to use a single thread .but since this is a work shirt we 're not going to worry about that .we 're going to tie a knot at the end .and again you 're going to place the button face up because it does have a different look .this is the front of the button , this is the back of the button. [CLS] [SEP]so you can see there is a difference , the back is flat .we 're going to take the button and place it where the button previously was and now the fun begins .start the thread .
the stretch that we 're going to be performing is called our butterfly stretch .this is going to be a seated stretch .`` now go ahead and have a seat on the floor melissa '' .very good .now this stretch is going to be working your inner thighs , as well as loosening up the ligaments and tendons in your joints and ankles .so to perform this , melissa is going to go ahead and bring her legs out and bring both of your feet together .now in this position , right , you want to put your feet nice and close to your body .now , you want to make sure to bring your mind right , to make sure you choose your toes , your pushing together this way .and what this does , this allows you to open up your hip joints a little more .you want to maintain a very straight posture throughout your back and now as you 're pushing here , you want to make sure to breathe in and breathe out .every time you exhale you want to feel your thighs , right , relaxing and pressing down with little bit more .now you 'll see some people do this stretch and they allow their legs to come up and down very fast .okay .we do n't want to really do this in the beginning , as just beginning with your stretches .you want to work your stretches very slow and very smoothly .you do n't want any jerking or any fast movements .it 's very easy to pull a tendons or joints , so you want to make sure just to move nice and easy through the stretch .to increase it , you can keep your feet where they are and lean more forward from your lower back , this way , right .and you 'll feel the stretch more throughout your lower back and more spreading through the upper hip , the upper thigh and outer thigh as well .this is our butterfly stretch , kung fu for health .
and now that we have a little bit more of a basic understanding of how the paddle wheel was designed , and how you might be able to make one yourself , let 's talk now about how to attach the paddle wheel to the canoe .you do n't want to just lay it on top of the canoe here , because it 'll slide back and forth , so we have to attach it to what we call the gunnels .the gunnels are these black pieces of plastic running along the top of the canoe frame here , and when adjusting the paddle wheel to your canoe , you want to take in a few things for consideration .first is most people that use the adaptive paddle wheel also use the adaptive seating , so you want to put the paddle wheel in a respective place of the person in the chair , meaning you do n't want to put the paddle wheel way out in front of em 'so they 're leaning over , trying to paddle ; straining their back .you want to put it in a comfortable area for them .and you also want to make sure ; just give it a good eye and make sure that the paddle wheel goes straight across the canoe , because if it 's off to the side you 'll just wind up paddling in circles all day , which is n't necessarily fun .the best way this paddle wheel connects to the canoe is it has some clamps here , and this clamp just goes underneath the gunnel , and you 'll hold it in place , and then it 's fastened down just by tightening this screw .and so , you 'll tighten it down like so , and you 'll do it to both sides , and once we have both sides set up. [CLS] [SEP]we 'll have a friend in here again , and just demonstrating how both the chair and the paddle wheel work together .
now here we have syvarris , our hero , who has a range of nine and our little knight guy .now , severus , as we see right here , has a clear line of sight through these evergreen trees at the back of the soldier .now , once again , this line of sight is clearly seen and clearly visible because , once again , line of sight is very important because the rules state that you can not see through and or shoot through these evergreen trees .now , on the other hand if syvarris was over here behind these two trees .there is actually a narrow. [CLS] [SEP]-- there 's actually a narrow slit between these two trees where he can actually still see the back of the knight .now , syvarris can actually shoot through this narrow inlet at the soldier because he has line of sight .so , again , the rules state that he can see through even if the trees are standing right next to each other on the hexagonal spaces and or tiles on the base .once again , you would have to make sure that syvarris has turned the right way for line of sight and can see the hittable parts on the soldier. [CLS] [SEP]but these are two instances of shooting through trees .one that 's really , clearly visible and the other that you have to get down at eye level and make sure that the line of sight is still there .
and it 's walk the dog .walk the dog looks like this .from a strong sleeper .you touch it to the ground and let it run .i 'll try that again so we can get the full view .it runs right across the ground like so .it works a little bit better on a hard floor .on the carpet it slows it down a little bit .try this on a hard floor , somewhere that the yo-yo is going to slide a little bit more as it 's running .to do walk the dog. [CLS] [SEP]what you do is you hold the yo-yo. [CLS] [SEP], you 're going to do a sleeper .just like we showed you before .strong sleeper .if you 're over carpet again , you 're going to want a really strong sleeper because you need a lot of momentum going. [CLS] [SEP]so it does n't slow the yo-yo down .what you do is you throw it .when you first start throwing your sleeper , you might get this .it 's kind of a little bit of sway motion .it 's important that you study that out .the easiest way to study it out is when you throw , if it 's rocking back and forth like that you just swing your hand a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]and it 'll steady right out .then you 're ready to walk the dog .when you 're at a competition , it 's usually about one foot .you just go from the back of your foot to the front and walk it like so .get it back to your hand .that 's going to be walk the dog .the farther you go , obviously , the longer it 's going to spin out , but you can do some cool variations with it if you practice a little bit .this one is walk the dog in between the legs .it can be a pretty fancy trick .that way the next time someone asks you to do walk the dog , you 'll be prepared .that 's walk the dog .
alright , every lacrosse game starts with a draw .you also do a draw after someone scored a point to resume the game and you do it in the beginning of the half too .so , basically , what it is , is it 's two players who turn their sticks with the backs towards each other with the ball in the middle. [CLS] [SEP]and you have both hands on the stick. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're trying to get up underneath the ball and fling the ball above your heads. [CLS] [SEP]and then all the teammates kind of move in to try to get the ball and grab possession .and so to win a draw , you want to make sure that you 're sturdy , that your legs are planted firmly and you want to have a good grip on your stick and the way you win it is get underneath the ball really quick and hit up .so you want to be the first to get under and hit up. [CLS] [SEP]and you want it to go hopefully , either towards a teammate. [CLS] [SEP]and you also want to be ready that if you can , to snag it .now i 've got melissa with me who 's going to help me. [CLS] [SEP]show us an example of the draw .so , the referee will place the ball in the back of your stick and you set up. [CLS] [SEP]and you 'll wait for the whistle , but we 're just going to count to three. [CLS] [SEP], okay ?one , two , three .
the important thing is to make sure that this sit is not reused and doing that we want you to cut out the hardness straps .if your getting the same sit. [CLS] [SEP]you like the fabric you can reuse the fabric but please destroy the hardness straps , try to destroy the sit as best as possible and we also ask that you get a sharpie and mark the sit in crash do not use .cause unfortunately these sits are fished out of trash and reused all the time .
so especially if you have just done your leg lifts or any other light kind of abdominal exercise you are going to want to reverse that and just sort of disperse some of the heat in your abs .this is fish pose .you do it and you are going to come down to sitting and then extend the legs in front of you , come back on to your elbows and you are going to gently let your head fall back as you lift the heart. [CLS] [SEP]so you are going to really press the heart towards the ceiling and release the abs even on to the floor .you are going to inhale and exhale here , however , is comfortable for you .you 're going to find in these poses that you are never going to do exactly what i 'm going to do. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're never going to do exactly what a person next to you. [CLS] [SEP]might do but just make sure that even though you are pushing your envelope you are doing it in a way that is productive and not in a way that is destructive so in to fish pose , inhale and exhale as you drop your abs back inhaling , heart lifts and exhaling everything releases .when you come up out of fish pose you are going to use an inhale to support with your breath and then gently come back to sitting. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll get ready for our next pose .
alright now we 're going to talk about word placement .sometimes you might want to use one word in particular , and the word might not be enough syllables or it might just not be a proper word , so you want to find an alternative word to use in that place .sometimes the word `` see '' would no be as big as `` observation '' .like : `` it was hard for me to 'see ' '' ,but you might you might want to be like :`` it was hard for me to me to make an 'observation ' , with all the constant hating , across the nation , but i 'm embracing , the situations , that i be facing .i 'd have had a whole different rhyme pattern if i 'd have just said , `` it 's hard for me to see '' or `` be a g '' .anyway , it kind of goes back to compound syllables .sometimes you want to even look into other words and more complex words for the fact of not making your record sound as ignorant , or make your record sound. [CLS] [SEP]so ... [CLS] [SEP]i hate a b c rappers .i hate the alphabet rappers .i hate the a b c rappers .i hate the cat in the hat rappers .i hate the sam i am , green eggs and ham rappers .so you want to always try to elevate yourself to the next level in your making music and your word .we 're going to call this one `` word choice '' , and your choice of words and exactly what word you use where .the last word is n't always the most important word .sometimes the first and the third word is the most important .
okay , what happens at this point after we 've taken this brief walk down memory lane , is the presentation of the gift .now do n't panic .a gift -- you 're thinking , oh my gosh , fiftieth wedding anniversary , fortieth wedding anniversary. [CLS] [SEP], i 've got to come up with something really good .not necessarily .sometimes the best gifts to present at a wedding anniversary are the gifts from the heart .maybe it 's a poem that you found , or that someone wrote .perhaps it 's a picture .maybe you could find a picture of the couple from their wedding or sometime in their life , or maybe even a current picture and have it put in a beautiful frame .a gift can really be anything , but do n't think in terms of it 's got to be something fabulous .it 's really more than anything a token of appreciation .and at this point in the speech , you present this gift and you make a brief statement about it .we have come together and we got you this gift , we want to present it to you at this time , just as a small token of our appreciation for you sticking together , for you being such an inspiration , for you guys loving each other and loving us .or whatever it is .it just needs to be a simple statement , and then you present the gift .
well , the first thing we do , every donor that comes in to donate is actually , the test process starts that day .believe it or not , a lot of people do n't think of it that way .but , we prick every donor 's finger to check their iron level .and we do that either through a hemoglobin test or hematocrit test , different places do different things .so , we do that test that day , that lets us know if for that day if your iron is high enough for you to donate blood .now , obviously , we 're not going to take your blood if it 's going to affect you negatively that day or in a negative way that day .so , we want to make sure you 've got enough iron to be good when you leave plus to be able to give us a pint , to help somebody in the hospital that actually needs it .so , we do that test that day .there are standard tests we do to every unit of blood to every donor .no matter if you donate one time or six hundred times .you have the same tests going on every time .that way it 's standard across the board .we make sure that every unit is as safe as it can be here at the american red cross .so , we do that , you know , some of the reasons are donors are differed ,you know it can be reasons such as travel , hepatitis. [CLS] [SEP]you know others things that come to play when the tests are done. [CLS] [SEP]that lets us know this is not a safe unit .we do let donors know if their tests come up positive , we do let the donors know that by either a letter or a personal contact to let them know , hey you need to come back in to be re tested because we want to make sure our tests are accurate and it was what it said it was .so , we want to get you back in and re test just to make sure everything is good .you know , we do n't see an awful lot of lost products because of that .we have a very very good donor base , they 're answering our questions properly , they know if they 've been in places or in situations that might be cause for deferral. [CLS] [SEP]and they do n't give and. [CLS] [SEP]most , everybody is honest on their answers that we get , we believe , and that makes our inventory as strong and as safe as it can be .we do as good a job as we can do with the tests and our donors that are coming in with us , and answering our questions properly to do what we need to do .and that ?s maintaining a safe blood supply .
and as you do this you are going to slide up , pick the leg up and do a round kick to the mid section or to the face .here is one slow , and here is one a little faster .the way it works with an opponent is as they throw their back fist. [CLS] [SEP]they are throwing a high back fist to the head just like that .you are going to block with the front hand doing an outside block. [CLS] [SEP]so you do this , boom .as you do this you are going to slide up and then as you pick the foot up. [CLS] [SEP]you are going to actually hook this hand down , pick the knee up and do a round kick aiming for the inside of the body or the face .we 'll just do one slow , one , two , and here is one a little faster , just like that .now this kick you can put a lot of power into it .you can really drive the technique in because you have a grab it is much easier to put power into the technique .usually your front leg round kick would be more of a speed kick than a power kick .again my name is wes rhodes from the chinese kung fu academy and that is how you perform the outside block , round kick .
in the medical history interview , some things come up that will prevent people from being able to donate blood .we call it a deferral .the most common reason people are deferred from donating is , hemoglobin for women especially .we have a requirement of twelve point five grams of hemoglobin for each whole blood donor .the reason being , is when you donate blood. [CLS] [SEP]your hemoglobin drops a couple points .and , we want to make sure that when your all done you feel well and you do n't have a reaction or anything like that .the next set of deferrals that are really common , is travel deferrals .and , if you travel to an area that is endemic for malaria you 're going to be deferred for one year from the day you return to the united states or the day you actually leave that endemic area .some common places people go that have a malaria risk are : south america , mexico , india and asia .the reason we are strict on that , is that because malaria has no blood test .you can not test blood to find malaria .and , with the new strings of malaria if a unit that was infected with malaria went through and went into a patient it would potentially kill that patient or cause a lot of harm .so , we want to make sure one year from the day you come back to eliminate any chance of anyone transmitting malaria .the other disease that we 're worried about that have to do with travel , is mad cow disease or creutzfeldt-jakob disease .so , with this one it 's actually a very strict rule .if you have lived in the united kingdom for a cumulative time of three months or more from nineteen eighty to nineteen ninety-six , you are permanently deferred from donating .and , this again is because there is no reliable test for mad cow disease .so , we can never tell if a unit was infected or not .and , along with that all european countries if you have lived there for five years a total of five years or more from nineteen eighty to the present .you will be eliminated from donating .unfortunately , along with the mad cows disease if you have served military time and you resided in a military base in some european countries you 'll also be deferred from donating .

lady j here. [CLS] [SEP], i 've got some of the pink , fun pink icing .icing ?what am i talking about ?chocolate , inside of my syringe here. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to place just a teeny bit in each of these little hearts here .my chocolate bears actually look like they 're almost ready to be , to be eaten .but they wo n't be ready until we get that cute little pink heart onto the teddy bear .and so , alrighty .so , once you 're done with the hearts , you 're going to do what ?yup , you 're going to stick it back into the freezer .alrighty .so once i fill these up , i feel like my chocolate 's already hardened just a little bit .so i may stick it back in the microwave , that might help flatten it out just a little bit .yeah , it 's starting to get a little chunky .it 's important that you do n't , you do n't fill these molds up too high ,because if you do then you 'll loose some of the form that you actually have , have been given in the mold and. [CLS] [SEP]so you 're going to have this cute mold. [CLS] [SEP]but then all this like extra , like halo of whatever .i need to , to heat this pink chocolate up just a little bit more .so , i 'm just going to stick that syringe in there .i let it sit too long , it got a little bit hardened , it cooled down just a little bit too much .and so , i 've only got one and a half more hearts. [CLS] [SEP]so once i get that done. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to fill up those hearts .so we 'll see you in our next segment .i 'm actually going to wrap things up here in just a little bit and share a few more tips with you guys about molding chocolate .

[CLS] [SEP]petersburg , florida .so let 's do a short combo , an advanced combo .we 're going to do our flutter , our pop , and our roll .now , karen 's going to play rhythm for me .you may have this rhythm at home , or you may have another rhythm that you can find and combine and put together your own little combo .all right , ready karen ?i 'm ready .all right .so it 's a flutter , pop , flutter , roll .i ca n't flutter and talk at the same time .pop , flutter , roll .good .so , again , listen to your music and see where you can put in your pops , flutters , and your rolls .good job .
you can not leave a child alone with pillows , stuffed animals , duvet covers , or blankets .a child can sometimes scoot their way onto something like a stuffed animal or a pillow , but then not actually be able to lift themselves up and off of it .there are numerous accounts of children actually suffocating on pillows that have been placed around them in order to keep them from rolling off a bed .these are very , very serious risks , and we really recommend that you not ever put any sort of stuffed animal , pillow , blanket , or anything like that into a crib with a child .blanket sleepers are the way to go when a baby is very young .obviously , they swaddle and they do n't move too much .again , just swaddle them .as they get older , you can use blanket sleepers .just be sure that you dress your baby warmly and avoid any sort of blankets that they can become entangled in or crawl under and not be able to come out from under .these are just things to keep in mind when you 're putting your baby to bed .
 , she wanted peonies in her yard , but her yard was a shade garden .it was huge , tall oaks that shaded everything .she had beautiful wild ferns and even wild lady slipper orchids popping up in her yard. [CLS] [SEP]but she wanted peonies .i tried to talk her out of it. [CLS] [SEP]but i came down the driveway one day to find her cutting down the oak tree. [CLS] [SEP]so she would have the sun for her peonies .it still was n't enough sun for peonies , they never did well and all the wild plants in her yard kind of disappeared .so it 's a real shame .do n't try to force it .use the right plant in the right place , that 's going to make your garden more successful .out here in the sunnier part of the border , it 's a little shaded now. [CLS] [SEP]but we 're getting later in the afternoon. [CLS] [SEP], i 've used plants that like that hot , dry , baking sun .plants that are really gon na thrive in that kind of a situation .plants like napata , plants like asthers , veronicas , and clemitis all really thrive in these full sun situations and. [CLS] [SEP]they 're really gon na jump out to the front and do a great job for me .but , they 're the right plant for a sunny place .what if we 're in the shade ?in a shadier situation there 's a whole different palate of plants .a whole different way to think about things .in the shade situation flowers are n't as plentiful as they are in that sunny situation. [CLS] [SEP]so we have to start thinking about things in a little bit of a different way .what are the foliage colors in contrast that i can get that are still gon na give me a great garden look .and here in this situation , i 've used one of my favorite plants , hostas .now this is a mix of hostas and in some ways it 's a hosta collection garden. [CLS] [SEP]but you can see that i 've contrasted the hostas with ferns .ferns have a lighter , airier feel contrasted with that big , solid leaf on the hosta and there 's so many shapes and colors both in the hostas and the ferns that i can get lots of different looks .contrasting it again with something solid , a bigger shrub , that 's going to give some presence to the garden even in winter is a great way for me to get 365 days a year out of this garden .so remember , when you 're doing a perennial garden , perennial plants should n't be the only part of the perennial garden .other deciduous and evergreen plants are gon na give you a presence throughout the year .
i have a secret for whipping cream .when i do catering , sometimes i do n't have the gift of a lot of time .so when i whip cream , i use a nice heavy heavy whipping cream .i put it in my mixer or. [CLS] [SEP]you can even hand. [CLS] [SEP]blend it. [CLS] [SEP]and i just whip and whip and whip it until it has a very stiff consistency like this .then over time , not a lot of times , it starts softening and gets nice and gooey which i can add on top of deserts which is my intention to add it to my dolce right here , balsamic marinated strawberries .while this calms down a little bit , i am going to add another secret ingredient , fresh mint leaves .they smell great .i love adding herbs to every dish if i can get away with it. [CLS] [SEP]and i can , especially with italian cooking because it really encompasses the wonderful flavor of italy .and fortunately california has a very similar climate. [CLS] [SEP]so we are blessed living in california here , where i live to add this wonderful fresh element to make this incredible food .so there is our wonderful balsamic strawberries .they have been sitting for a few minutes so they 've had a chance to cook down and sweeten and kind of make a nice syrup. [CLS] [SEP]and i have the fresh mint incorporated into it .i am going to let that sit for just a minute. [CLS] [SEP]and i am going to serve it with just a dollop of this fresh whipping cream , just like that .beautiful. [CLS] [SEP]and i reserve some nice big mint leaves as a garnish. [CLS] [SEP]and maybe i will even add an extra berry to the top , pack it right there. [CLS] [SEP]and there is a yummy light refreshing and healthy meal .
i 'm here in salt lake city , utah .and , we 're talking about my space on the inter-net , and i 'm going to show you how to hide your blog section , on your my space page .ok , i 'm already blogged in on myspace.com .and , so i 'm going to show you now , how to hide your blog section on your my space page .so , what we 're going to do is , we 're going to minimize , my space .and , we 're going to go to the start menu , and go up to internet explorer .and then we 're going to go to the search engine , and google.com .and , what we 're going to search under is , my space codes .and now , we 're just going to click on the first one .and then we 're going to go under my space tweaks on the left hand side , click on that .ok , now we 're going to scroll down , to hide and block and extended network , and this will hide your blog , so , go ahead and click on that .and then we 're going to skip this little ad here .ok , now what we 're going to do is , as we 're waiting for it to load , this , this code that 's going to bring up , is going to hide your blog .and so , what we 're going to do , is , we 're going to click .we 're going to close this , and we 're going to click , copy to copy the , the code for it to hide your blog .so click copy .ok , now let us copy .we 're going to minimize this web page .we 're going to maximize our my space once again .and we 're going to go under edit profile , which is right here .and , we 're going to paste it , under music , and we 're going to scroll back up , and click save changes .now , our profile is updated , so we 're going to view our profile .now , as you can see , your blog and bulletins are now not there .they 're hidden , so that no one can view them , unless you put them , physical again .
to finish our decoupage bookend , we 're going to glue some non-skid surface on the bottom of the bookend .this is the screwed-in end. [CLS] [SEP]and i 've cut a piece of non-skid .this is a , like a shelf paper. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's made of a , some sort of a fabric covered with rubber and that works perfectly for a non-skid bottom .you want to use a good amount of the tacky glue , of a nice thick clear drying craft adhesive .you put a real good amount on that .it will take quite a few days to dry completely because the non-skid is rubber. [CLS] [SEP]so the air does n't get to it. [CLS] [SEP]and it 'll take a little bit of time to dry .but , it makes a very nice surface .you can use felt also , but the non-skid is nice for a bookend because the bookend is supposed to hold heavy books from sliding over .so the non-skid will help in that , keeping the bookend from sliding .and you just want to coat that over , you cut the non-skid to the exact bottom of the bookend .just place that on , make sure that it 's even on all sides and you can let it dry in this position .that will help hold it down .
in a single leg stretch we are connecting back muscles to our abdominal muscles by connecting with legs and shoulders as well .you lay down on a soft mat or a carpet and bring that right knee in towards you and put your left hand right around that right foot and then look up towards your foot and bring that left knee in , now take a deep breath in and switch , where both legs are tucked right in towards you with the left knee. [CLS] [SEP]and then you are going to exhale , switch. [CLS] [SEP]and you are going to inhale and exhale , switch and inhale , lengthen out. [CLS] [SEP]so the toes go out long and exhale .now , it is easier sometimes to start off doing this by lifting that leg up , inhale and exhale , it is more challenging as you bring it down towards the floor .but the back stays in the floor and control it , inhaling and exhaling , inhaling and exhaling , release , just lay right down .
all right , the drink we 're about to make is called sailor 's delight .let 's go and put some ice in a glass , and we 'll measure out two ounces of peach schnapps .hmm , not quite two ounces there , but. [CLS] [SEP], that 's okay , this will be a weak sailor .and we 'll go ahead and finish it off with some cranberry juice , go ahead and fill it up .and grab a mixer , just give it a pour back and forth .that 's good enough .and we 'll grab a glass and pour it in .okay .add a straw , and hope you got your sea legs for this one 'cause it 's going to be a delight .and obviously if you want to make it stronger you can do that full two ounces , or you can bump it up to three or four if you want to get really delightful .bottoms up .
flourishing , this is an entire book written about the art of flourishing .flourishing is to my mind the icing on the cake .and it 's in itself a whole art form , as much as cake decorating is an entire art form unto itself .and they 're people in the field of calligraphy who specialize in this type of work .if you want to see some really dramatically , absolutely marvelous flourishing , check out the universal penman , look at these guys ; these things have to be designed , and then they 're executed to look as if they came straight out of the pen .ornamental pen designs and flourishes. [CLS] [SEP], i think this is probably a dover publication ; anyway this is how elaborate a flourishing can become ; see how even and the tone ?and here 's another book , ornate pictorial calligraphy , pen lettering , gems of flourishing .and there are people who can do these things far more beautifully than i can .however , i do love to flourish .this is a , one of my poster baths , veritas truth , and this is my humble attempt to see if i can make flourishing work with roman capitals .it can work , but. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]not sure this is something i 'd give myself an a for .anyway , let 's do a little bit of flourishing .so , you can flourish in different ways .you can flourish because you 're using the pen , and you come across a capital , and you want to give that capital a beautiful flourish .
today i 'm going to teach you how to do the square base or the basic flower base .what we 're going to start with is we 're going to start with a square piece of paper and. [CLS] [SEP]what we 're going to do is we 're going to fold it .actually we 're going to do two of the most simplest folds right here , which is just a mountain fold in half like this which is called a book fold. [CLS] [SEP]i believe .open it up and do the same thing here .like so .open it back up , fold it like so , this is called a sheet field or shawl fold or. [CLS] [SEP]however you want to call it .i 've been calling it sheet for all my life. [CLS] [SEP]so that 's how i know it by. [CLS] [SEP]is a sheet fold , like so .what we 're going to do is we 're going to open it up .sheet fold it again like so .now , what we have here is you can see we have our paper bisected in many different ways .so what we 're going to do is we want our square fold to be this square here .so to get this what you 're going to do. [CLS] [SEP]is you 're going to fold your paper over like this , and then open it back up along that crease line there .and then bring your back to where it forms like that. [CLS] [SEP]and it 'll basically just almost form itself once you get that form in .so now that you got that you 're basically going to do the same thing with this side , and fold it down over , and there you have it .should look like this when you open it up , it 's going to be folded like so .and that is your square base .play around with it and have fun making your origami .
we all remember that .memories .how do you keep a relationship lasting a lifetime ?this is dr. [CLS] [SEP]paul , author of `` boomer girls , '' a boomer woman 's guide to men and dating .tradition is something that makes a lifetime of a relationship .those memories that you have from the day you met , the first time you kissed , the first time you had dinner by candlelight , the first time you walked along the beach , the pictures you have , the times you shared , those are the memories that build the foundation for a lifetime relationship .this is a tough time .people in many cases do n't have that , and if you want to build that foundation to make that relationship last a lifetime , those are the things you need .you need to take a look at those pictures you 've had in the past , the friends you 've had together , the places you 've gone .memories and tradition keep that romance steadfast ; keep that relationship lasting that lifetime that you 're looking for .so remember that .memories .the way we were is the way we want to continue being .this is dr. [CLS] [SEP]paul .may your fantasies of today be your realities of tomorrow .
alright , i moved the shrimp over to a different location .and i 'm going to go ahead and get ready to make our vegetables .so we 're going to cut two cloves of garlic. [CLS] [SEP], we 're going to mince them very fine ; you see that the garlic will always slide up the edge of the knife .so once the two are together , we 're going to mix them a little bit more than we did for our other two dishes .then we 're going to cut half of a small red onion , half .and we 're going to go along , mince , so that not as small as the garlic , but still fairly small .we want the color definitely to be seen .
ok.i 'm going to use another example here of the whammy effect .and , i 'm just going to have like different examples. [CLS] [SEP]i 'll show you with which the numerous different things you can do .and , pretty much it 's up to your imagination and what you can do with your foot essentially .in this one , i 'm just going to play a little passage down to a major .and , i 'm going to from the twelfth .you know , so you can create crazy kinds of stuff .and , i probably ca n't do that twice in a row at least on that last note .but , pretty much what i 'm doing there is just bring it straight up .and , just bring it on my foot. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm bringing it back very slightly .because , i still want to keep that high register .you know , almost giving it that nice harmonic sound .and , then bringing it down for each one .so , it has a nice little vibrato at the end too .but , again the point being having your foot bring in kind of just kind of find nice little filter sounds there to add a crazy sounding effect to your guitar playing .
when it comes to very small children. [CLS] [SEP]it 's not realistic to be able to expect them to fight back and defend themselves like a young adult or a teenager would do .our first line of defense , obviously , you want the children to run away , get help , make as much distance as possible , but if they 're already grabbed or the person already has a hold of them there are some very simple things that we can do with them that 'll increase the time it takes for the attacker to steal them .the longer and more uncomfortable the attacker gets more likely they are to be , to just give up the attack , let child go and move on to an easier target .one of the most important things , as well as the simple physical things is making sure the child uses their voice as a weapon .you want to teach the children to say something that 's going to get attention .if they simply just scream or cry people might assume they 're just having a tantrum. [CLS] [SEP]or maybe they 're just being a normal child .so you want to teach them to say things like , 'help me ! ' , 'this is a stranger ! ' , 'this is not my mom ! ' , 'this is not my dad ! ' , things that would get people 's attention and make them look and pay attention to the attacker .things that make the attacker very uncomfortable. [CLS] [SEP]so we want our children to yell when they 're being attacked .this is not my dad !go away !you 're a stranger !do n't touch me !as you work with your children it 's important to let them know that if they are in trouble they need to find an adult that they can trust .it 's ok for them to run up to the nearest house if they 're running away from someone who just tried to steal them , to knock on the door and yell for help is very important .one of the most easy ways is that abductors take children is to get them close to the car where they can grab them .it 's critically important that children know they should never , ever approach a car if there is someone in it they do n't know and trust implicitly .now one of the best ways we can do this is have a family password .when you have a family password that 's a secret word that only you and your children know , that if somebody ever needs to pick them up other than yourself or your husband or your wife , maybe their older brothers and sisters , there is a secret word that they 'll know and they 'll ask for .if that person does n't know the word they do not go with that person .
clancy rose : all right .so now we have the espresso shot .the grounds are in the porta filter basket prepared to pull a shot of espresso .we have our milk steamed up to the right temperature and the right amount of foam. [CLS] [SEP]so we 're going to pull a single shot into a cappuccino cup for our cappuccino .so we have that shot ready for the cappuccino , and once again you 're going to see that cream on top of the espresso which is the mark of a good espresso shot .you can take your milk and once again you can kind of swirl it around and pour your cappuccino .
the foot work that we 're going to be working is called the step through ; the step through is performed from our fighting stance , both feet are in the general direction ; my center of gravity is in between my knees , the weight is on the balls of my feet and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm in the split guard position .now to step through we 're going to turn your front foot out ; you 're going to step forward with your rear foot , as you do this your hands are going to change position ; the bottom hand is going to come to the outside of the top hand as the top hand goes down , i step forward stepping threw .again , the forward foot turns out ; my real hand comes on the outside of my top hand , my top hand drops ; i step threw .i 'm going to let melissa demonstrate it a few times to go ahead and point out some of the finer details .o.k. [CLS] [SEP], now we want to make sure that in the guard position ; right , we feel that our ; we 're in a nice tight position .the forward foot turns out , as this happens the forward hand ; top hand pulls in slightly and the bottom hand comes out .she 's going to advance threw in switching those hands off ; good .you 'll notice that she controlling the center of gravity ; both feet are going the same general direction , she 's going to turn the forward foot out ; bring the top hand in , switch out .this is how we perform the step threw kung fu for help .
now , some precaution should be taken when you actually do some traveling. [CLS] [SEP]and that is that in foreign countries you do n't know where some of the source of food or water comes from .so , do n't take any risks .i recommend and advise that when you go to a foreign country , number one thing is that you do n't actually drink water from the tap , cause you do n't know where the source of the water comes from .my recommendation is that you bring lots of bottled water , you know , go the hotel or go the local grocery stores and buy local stored bottled water and also to bring a lot of fruit juices with you that 's already packaged .do n't buy freshly squeezed juice on the streets or in the stores there , because you never know how they have cleaned or if they have cleaned their bottles or containers properly .so , these are some of the ways you can reduce the risk of getting food poisoning when you 're on your vacation to a foreign country .
so now i 'm going to score the edges of the handle itself .just like on the teapot i want this to be really goopy because i 'm not going to be smoothing much in .i 'm mostly just going to be pressing this in .so once i 've got that ready i 'll line it up on my cup. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'll press that in very firmly .it wants to slip around because i 've got it. [CLS] [SEP]so goopy. [CLS] [SEP]so you have to kind of force it into place .and then once you 've got it pressed on there. [CLS] [SEP]just get your finger moist and smooth out that connection .and once you 've got that connection nice and smooth you can mess with the actual curve of the handle .i 'm just going to raise the inner shoulder of that a little bit .so there. [CLS] [SEP]i 've got a teacup with a handle that matches my teapot .
an additional octave that you can play is the e octave .i 'm playing the e on the d string , with the e on the a string together .and when you 're playing this octave , what you 're going to hear , what you should hear is actually a little bit of a ringing sound coming from the open e string .it 's very , very faint , so it may be hard to hear , but when you 're playing your harmonic you also heard a ringing , as well .so you 're looking for a similar type of ringing , and the ringing will let you know that you 're playing in tune .and you can adjust your fingers until you find the sound that you want .and once you 've found your sound , the two e 's , when you 're playing them together , will sound in unison , and it 's going to sound perfectly in tune .
other after market products that we see a lot of in the field. [CLS] [SEP]people add these pads to the hardness or the shoulders again. [CLS] [SEP]you may be introducing to much distance between the shoulder and the hardness which would cause injury in a crash .a very popular product that we see a lot of is the mirrors attached to the head rest in lined with the baby. [CLS] [SEP]so they can look in there rear view mirror and see the baby .the biggest problem with a after market mirror mounted here is because again due to the way the system the rear facing system is designed to work in a crash it rebounds into the seat .so anything here that is hard in the seat has the capability or the possibility of hitting the infant in the face .so again you do n't want to introduce anything that is n't soft enough. [CLS] [SEP]that would n't that you would n't feel confidence enough to hit your self in the face with .if it is a heavy object , if it is a hard object it needs to be installed somewhere where it is not going to cause injury .if it is a sudan put it in the truck , if it is a suv tie it down .use one of the dog weights you can get those at the pet store and the compression on the back of the suv they are used to keep dogs in the back. [CLS] [SEP]but it also keeps your stroller , it slows down the case. [CLS] [SEP]snapple. [CLS] [SEP]your just bought at the stores out there. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to keep everything down because it does n't matter a roll of things like this when you are flying around in the car when you have been hit. [CLS] [SEP]is very hard .a roll of duct tape is very hard , the mighty tie is really hard , anything that is hard books. [CLS] [SEP]hardback books are hard , most of the time my purse qualify for a cargo so anything that you do n't want to hit your baby with or hit your self on the head with try to get those tied down really tight .men like flashlights , stirring wheel clubs , baseball bats ,anything like that make sure that they are not going to become a object that is going to fly through the car and injury somebody .
today we 're cooking up some chili verde .alright , now we 've added our anaheims which we chopped up , and to the meat , we now want to do some chicken broth .just get your chicken broth , pour it on in .it 's real good .alright , take a look at this .this is what it 's going to be looking like .get our chicken broth here , stir it up .now i 've got two cans , i 'm going to add one more .that 's just not enough .so let 's chop it up , i mean open it up .alright , alright .alright , now we 're going to turn it up a little more , we 're going to let it sit right here .we 've added it , you can add if you want it thicker , do n't add as much .if you want it runny , add a bunch .alright , you can , one can can stretch it a little more .so just do what you want .play with it .add a little more flour if you want it to be a little thicker .just , i did n't add a lot .i did n't want just the taste of flour , but that does thicken .so that 's good .
okay , in this segment , we 're going to cover inspecting the brake system and that 's just the portion of the brake system directly applicable with the rear wheel .and what we want to do prior taking apart the brake system , we want to look it over thoroughly .check the brake hoses and make sure there 's dry rot , cracks or kinks in those .check the alignment and the routing of the manual parking brake cable .and a good visual inspection of the caliper assembly , the sliding and the pads themselves and. [CLS] [SEP]you 'll get a better look at the pads once you get the caliper apart .but if you get a look of everything while it 's sitting in there. [CLS] [SEP]and you pull apart. [CLS] [SEP]and you see one pad 's worn more than the other or the are. [CLS] [SEP]pads worn cockeyed .and you look at it. [CLS] [SEP]and you see calipers trying to sit there. [CLS] [SEP]cockeyed , then you know why those pads ended up in that position .it gives you more information in case. [CLS] [SEP]you 've got another problem to help you sort out what 's causing the problem .because if you pull out brake parts and one caliper or one brake pad is worn more than the other brake pad and you put it back together the same way you took it apart , you might be putting the problem right back into your system .it could be something related to a brake pad not sliding correctly because of lubrication or any number of things .but that 's the importance of inspecting the system .you want to pick up those flaws or deficiencies or identifications of why various parts did n't wear correctly so you can verify what 's causing the problem , so that you ensure doing your rear brake replacement and servicing that you get that issue corrected .so , we 're not putting a problem back on the vehicle with a new set of brake pads to wear incorrectly or give us weaker or lesser braking capabilities because of a problem binding or the caliper not moving correctly because something else is worn or out of its service limits .so , at this time , we 're just going to look over the rubber brake hose that goes from the back. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's the rubber section that 's connecting the caliper to the steel line on the body .that allows for the rear suspension travel , the rubber hose allows the flexibility of movement .and it 's going to be hard to see in your camera angles. [CLS] [SEP]but you 'll need to stick your hand into the wheel a little bit , follow that brake hose .it runs down through the trailing arm and up there .this one appears to be in good conditions .there 's no signs of dry rot , cracking or breakage .you 'll need to put your hand back into the back corner of the rear wheel to see the parking brake cable .you 'll see the cable assembly , its mounting bracket , a rubber boot that goes over the end of the cable where it goes up and connects to the caliper .you want to make sure those are all in place .they look correctly .the brackets are bent or signs of kinking or wearing .and after having inspected that , try and get a good visual , it 's a little bit harder to see the actual pads themselves .check the relationship of the alignment between the caliper mounting bracket and the caliper itself , everything looks to be in good condition and functioning correctly , we 'll go ahead and replace the brake , disassemble the brake component .watch our next segment on removing the caliper .
and we got a stick and everyone from about 2 years on to about 25 poked at it. [CLS] [SEP]and they finally broke it. [CLS] [SEP]and of course the kids went nuts when the candy went .i bought the candy at a dollar store for about 10 bucks. [CLS] [SEP]i think so that is a great thing that is going to cost you 20-25 bucks the most .one of the things about the entertainment is those little kids get real antsy. [CLS] [SEP]and they need some entertaining. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to be able to enjoy the reunion ,visit with the adults. [CLS] [SEP]so you might even have your teenagers been in charge with the pinata .they go do that while your discussing you know. [CLS] [SEP]old times with the older adults. [CLS] [SEP]so the pinata is a excellent tool and it was a huge hit at our reunion .
and for your listeners as well , too , because everybody 's getting something out of this .one thing you 'll remember that works , as value added for your sales department , especially is using some of the clients for your station as guests , as a contact for the newsroom .next time there 's something like a snow storm on the way , why not get a client who sells tires on the air to tell you why you need this new set of tires and how to drive a bit more defensively in the winter time .this is great because it 'll give them a chance to feel like an expert , which they are , because they know the product more than you do .and you get that extra bang for the dollars that they 're spending with the radio station , hopefully come back and do some more spending because they 'll have a lot of people talking about that .you can use the clip on the news department , or on the next news cast .it 's a win-win situation all the way around .
how do you fight ?well , that is actually a very interesting question .to me , all fighting begins with a mindset .my mindset is that no one touches me without my permission .that is my guiding line .no one touches me without my permission .and , if you touch me without my permission , i am going to prevent you from doing that .that does not mean i am going to be able to beat you in a fight .it does not mean i am going to win every fight .but , i am always going to protect myself .i have a high sense of self worth .that being said , there is two types of fights .organized sport fighting where there are rules , a referee , and a goal .and then , there is street fighting .self defense where there are no rules , and there is no referee and it is not a place you want to be .let me discourage you from getting into any fight that is not an organized sport fight that you are preparing for with a coach .here is the key .when a self defense situation arises , a street fight situation arises , people talk about technique a lot .all self defense is mental .ninety percent mental , ten percent technique .the initial reaction of your body when it is threatened is fight or flight .that is the subconscious reaction .it is not a conscious reaction .you will feel probably hard to breathe .you will probably feel as though your arms and legs are suddenly very heavy and that your body releasing blood to your major muscles as you prepare to fight or flight .it is an adrenaline dump that , for someone who is not used to it , can be debilitated .so , regardless of the techniques you know , you will never get to fire those unless you learn to deal with the adrenal dump that precedes a self defense situation .you do that first by kind of putting yourself in situations where you are under some stress in a safe , organized manner , so that you get used to that adrenal dump .and then , the second thing we do is we control that by breathing .continuing to breathe .typically when you get tense and scared , fight or flight , you stop your breathing which exasperates the problem .key is to breathe .a martial arts master thinks about breathing with the entire diaphragm and the stomach out , pushing air all the way to the bottom of the lungs , not just this surface panting but strong deep breaths .and , in that scenario , the martial arts master , while there is chaos everywhere , the martial arts master maintains the quiet mind .and , that is how a martial arts master fights .so again , street fighting versus organized fighting .join a good martial arts school , a martial arts teachers ' association school and learn organized fighting .it is a lot more fun .it is a lot more safe and it makes more sense .i am john graden .i hope that helps .thanks !
so , what i 'm going to have you all do is can you step back lauren just a little step .sue stepping forward and walking you through uttanasana forward fold .so , bring your arms down to your sides .palms facing forward .standing nice and tall .crown the head , reaching towards the ceiling .beautiful .take a nice inhale .as you exhale , bring in the hands to heart center .inhaling , arms all the way up. [CLS] [SEP]and as you go up take a nice gentle back bend .exhaling , slowly come into a nice forward fold .now , notice they 're forward folding from the hips not from the spine .beautiful forward fold .relax your head .some of the benefits of standing forward fold is you 're getting a really good stretch on the hamstrings .also , across the lower back .it 's a nice , wonderful relaxing pose .many , many benefits .now , to come up very slowly .inhale , arms all the way forward .take the back bend .exhale , arms down to the sides .again , palms facing forward .beautiful .one more time .take a good inhale .exhale , heart center .inhaling , arms all the way up .take the back bend , enjoy it .as you you exhale , slowly and gently forward folding .beautiful .hands beside the feet at this point and time .relax the head .and , ready to come up very slowly .inhaling , arms all the way forward .take that wonderful back bend .exhale , arms down to the side .nice straight spine .and , that is our standing forward fold uttanasana .
we 've already punched the holes using the 1/8 circle punch .i punched 2 in the top and 2 in the bottom .i just eye ball them .some people like to go ahead punch 2 in the top , fold this flap down , make a little mark with their marker .that way all your holes are lined up correctly .the next step is we 're going to take our ribbon .i like to use about a foot , 12 inches , because it 's easy to make a nice big bow .you 're going to start from the inside of the box .feed your ribbon out on both sides .if you take your ribbon and cut a little angle at the end. [CLS] [SEP]so you have a sharp point. [CLS] [SEP], it 's a lot easier to thread .you 've got your ribbon in the bottom .you want to attach here if you 've done some kind of name tag or heart .something like that .go ahead and fill it with some nice paper , some candies , or. [CLS] [SEP]you could put movie tickets , jewelry , or something fun like that in there .we 're going to go ahead and close it right up .tie a big bow in it .again , you 're just pushing the ribbon through the holes pulling it tight .what 's nice about these boxes is i love that they tie closed because my kids ca n't get into them and check out what they 're getting for valentine 's day .we 're going to tie a quick little bow .you 've got your package .it 's good to go .another valentine 's treat that your family will love .
so we are going to top off this eye look with some black mascara .so we are going to start on the bottom lashes .just do a wiggle , side to side motion .and on the upper lashes , we are going to roll on top , start at the base and wiggle our way up through .holding a little bit at the tip , allowing the polymers and mascara to dry and create some curl .so , again , we are going to do ; can you look up for me , do just a little side to side motion on the lower lashes , eliminate clumping .can you look down for me ?we are going to roll on the top , start at the base , wiggle our way up through , and hold for a second at the tip .so , that is how you would want to finish off your eye look using your black mascara .
okay , this is going to be the first example in 12-8 where we 're going to have consecutive notes on the bass drum .as we get faster , and you 'll see this when i play it in the shuffle version on the high hat , it can start to test the strength of your bass drum foot , but it does n't have to .these patterns sound just as good played slowly , so here it is .( plays )and here it is with the shuffle pattern .( plays ) so as you can see there 's a consecutive figure there on the bass drum .it happens to coincide with notes on the high hat .where it 's going to get more complicated is when we start putting notes on the bass drum and snare between the shuffle notes on the high hat , which we 'll get to later .
ok.now our next stage is we 're going to start rough shaping the head .it 's cutting everything that 's not indicated on here that that we do n't need .so we 're going to needle it .i will usually start at the top of the head , try and start rounding that off .right now i 'm using a hard exacto blade .if i want to speed things up i can heat my blade up , and it can cut a little easier .generally i 'm just rounding it off , just starting to create the shape of the head in a rounded form ; till i can get it down to the dimensions that are indicated in my drawing .when we 're finished this still wo n't be a head. [CLS] [SEP]but it 'll at least be rough blocked , squared off shapes that you 'll see in just a minute .
in your right hand place it between your index finger and middle finger and your thumb , because when you move your thumb away , yeah exactly .so show that they 're locked together and then on your last pull gently separate your thumb from the matchstick , pull the matchstick through like that .now , keep doing this until you 're really good at it , because if you accidentally knock it over here you ca n't recover .it 's happened a few times , so remember just keep at as close to your thumb as you can .in behind , there you go , back out , i just did it there .in , out , okay !when you do this trick a lot of times people think that you 're actually switching hands and switching matchsticks , there by giving you a lot more credits than is really necessary and that 's not necessarily a bad thing .
hi , i 'm emily larew .and to close up this last five , six , seven , eight , for our advanced hip-hop series .we 're going to do a slide to the floor and jump up to finish strong .ok ?so we have just finished doing a roll , three , four .your left hand is going to go to the floor .you 're going to push onto your left hip , slide through that opening .ok ?from there you 're going to bring your right foot forward .you 're going to stand up and jump out to finish strong on eight .alright ?let 's break that down again .it 's a lot of upper body strength and using the lower body at the same time so you do n't get stuck .three , four .we go five , push , six , seven , eight .good .let 's do it again , one more time .so we broke it down and you 're feeling good .we did one , two , three , four , we have five , six , seven , eight .good job .and that concludes our roll to the floor , slide to the floor and standing up .
if you want , it would be great .just a real low simmer through. [CLS] [SEP]and so now we are getting ready to serve it. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'll show you. [CLS] [SEP]how .so now everything is together and the rice is cooked within the meatballs after all this time we have some vegetables that are crisp and some that are just real soft .so i like to get a nice bowl , look at all the colors in there. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm just going to put that in. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to grab a couple of meatballs .see the rice in those ?i like to have a couple more , so we add those and a little extra soup .then you can go to nice shreds of corn tortillas that we did. [CLS] [SEP]and you can hear the crispness of that. [CLS] [SEP]and this adds that extra texture on top that i was talking about .so you just grab a few of those and sprinkle them around ( get a couple of them )so now you have a great albondigas meatball soup with a garnish and bon appetite .
today , i thought we 'd talk about how to draw mouths .sounds like a mouse. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's mouths .and i pre , i already did the noses. [CLS] [SEP], i already did some eyes here .and we 're going to go ahead and include a mouth here on a. [CLS] [SEP], here is one from a side profile , which is done a lot in the seventies and the earlier style caricatures .basically it is do the top lip first and have it come back. [CLS] [SEP]and you could actually do a little bit of shadowing there by doing a cross hatching , to get the top lip to have more shadow .and then you do the bottom part .and imagine where the bottom part of the lip is .you do n't want that line to come out that much .you could actually end it right there if you wanted to .but just because of demonstration purposes , i 'm showing you that , that 's a bottom lip .now on the total frontal ones , you got to imagine that there 's a thin line coming right down the middle of this here .straight on .and these are actually my least favorite .i do it sometimes but there 's a lot caricature. [CLS] [SEP]i also do a lot of frontal caricatures .so you imagine that the front lip here .and you know sometimes guys do n't have much of this kind of curve right there .but just because we 're doing demonstration .he 's smiling , so here 's the inside of the mouth right there .and here 's the bottom of the teeth .sometimes you see a little bit more of the teeth on the bottom and then the lip .here 's the teeth .and now on the profile ones , you have a little bit more of a turn there and a little bit less here .so it 's longer on that side and short on this side .once again the lip is curved more on this side .and you can even do , the lip showing there .teeth , with the gums and everything .alright , there 's some of the different samples of , of , of mouths for you .thank you guys for joining in my studio today .
so we put them up on our back in the backyard and we put them up here on the garage .it is important for me that i don ’ t do something that looks like everybody else ’ s .for that reason and because we are kind of in a shaded area , i am going to do something with a little more foliage and a lot of other window boxes .i ’ ve chosen this boston fern here as a great center piece because it matches up so well. [CLS] [SEP]with the christmas ferns that i have down here in the garden .so i am sort of extending the garden up the wall .that ’ s a great idea .if you have colors or plants in the garden , you can reference them. [CLS] [SEP], it ’ s a great way .for a bit of a splash and color , and to add something trailing over the edge , i want to put in these vinca vines .again , it is sort of the same thing .i ’ ve got this wonderful cream and green variegation that matches up really nicely with some of the cream and green variegation that i have down here in my hasta border .finally for that last little punch you call it ; i am going to plant up some of these nice pink torenias that are going to give me a little splash of flower color in here to complete the picture along with the ferns and the vincas .now i love these manger type boxes , but it is not the only kind of box out there .there are wooden boxes and what not. [CLS] [SEP]but if you like to look at these manger boxes , here ’ s a quick secret .when i first put these in 2 years ago , we lined it with plastic .we poked holes through the plastic .that means that my raffia lining on the outside here. [CLS] [SEP]hasn ’ t rotted away in a single season .i ’ m going into my third season now using the same raffia .so it ’ s the little tricks and tips that will really help you build an outstanding window box color display that is going to make you the envy of the neighborhood .try some things on your own , experiment .sooner or later you will come up with the right mix that fits you and your lifestyle. [CLS] [SEP]
hey , i 'm chelsea bogazzi with suburbanheresy.com. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're here today talking about beauty and make up tips .and this my model nicole. [CLS] [SEP]and we just finished doing some of her makeup. [CLS] [SEP]and now we 're going to talk a little bit about brows and shaping and having the correct eyebrow shape .a good way to start out is you measure the brow from the inner corner of the eye. [CLS] [SEP]and you want your brows to start directly above the inner corner of the eye .so everything on the inside of that corner of the eye you want to wax or pluck out .so nicole 's is actually right on .hers are really hers are shaped quite well .she has a really good shape of her eyebrows .so really we just need to clean up a few stragglers that are hanging out there .but when you look at your brows in the mirror , you want them to start right at the inner corner of your eye .and then the arch you want it to start , if you took a brush or a ruler or a straight edge and you started from the nose and go to the otter iris , and that 's right where your arch should be .that 's where the arch of the brow should be .and then your eyebrows should end , if you take this and go from the nose to the otter corner of the eye , the brow should end right there .so you can see her brow is a little bit short .but that 's o.k . [CLS] [SEP]because you can always fill them in .and then when you decide to pluck you just want to make sure that you do n't take them too thin .we saw where her arch should be , so we 're just going to go ahead and pluck out right there so that she has a higher arch .just going to pluck those out .you always want to make sure that your eyebrows are plucked when you 're going to be in photography like your wedding or anything .whenever you 're going to be doing your makeup you want to make sure your brows are fresh because it 'll make your makeup look a hundred times better are clean and shaped .
the drink that we are about to make is called belize rum punch .the first thing we are going to do is put some ice in a glass and we are going to start off with a shot ,actually two shots of light rum ,theres one and two. [CLS] [SEP], follow that up with a shot of dark rum .there we go and next an orange liquor , triple sec , one shot. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll go ahead and do a shot of creme de coconut. [CLS] [SEP], there we are and a shot of sour mix , two splashes of grenadine .we are almost there .there 's one , two and last we are just going to top it off with a little bit of pineapple juice .now we 'll mix these up and once we get everything mixed together. [CLS] [SEP]there is only going to be one thing left to do .sit back and enjoy your belize rum punch while you listen to the sound of the wind rustling through the palm trees .there we go , bottoms up .
alright we 're going to talk about why we soak the tamarind .it 's a dried fruit in this state. [CLS] [SEP]and we soak it to soften it up which makes our henna paste .i 'm going to show you how to do this .first of all you crack off the little bit of a shell and you can see it 's kind of a rooty looking plant. [CLS] [SEP]and there 's seeds in here where all these little lumps are. [CLS] [SEP]are seeds and this does n't by itself does n't really look like much , but when we cut it up and mix it with the lemon juice that we 're going to use here in a few minutes , it makes a nice brown paste that we mix with the henna and. [CLS] [SEP]it adds , helps to add to the reddish color and the thickness in the paste. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's natural and organic .and you want to get , you know i think two lemons is about enough , but you really want to get , you know about a half a cup , a good half a cup .so we get all the lemon juice in there .so now we 're going to put our tamarind in. [CLS] [SEP]and i like to break mine up just a little bit .it 's kind of chewy and it has these dark little seeds in it , you 'll see , and as this sets it 's going to make a nice little paste .you know what , i think i 'm going to put one more in than this little root , you just take it off and throw it away .now it swishes around , now see , as you see this. [CLS] [SEP]the lemon , the acidity in the lemon juice is going to do a couple of things .it 's going to soften up this tamarind , and you 're not going to believe how slimy it gets .it also darkens it up .it helps , it draws out some of the color that 's in the tamarind naturally .i 'm going to let it soak for about an hour , maybe more , maybe less , keep checking on it .it 's no big deal , but you 'll know when it 's ready .it 'll just be all nice and slimy .
in this step , we 're going to talk about the proper procedure for remounting your license plate and your last rear lamp .your license plate bracket is going to mount through the mounting holes for your lamp .as you can see , we have some studs here on the lamp , they 're going to go through and hold down the other side .our new kit came with a new license plate mounting bracket .as you can see , they 're identical .being that we already have one mounted to our plate , i 'm not going to install the new one , however , if you do n't have one , you going to want to remove the bolts here and here , reinstall your plate bracket like so , and then tighten the bolts down .you always want it to be stepping forward .as you can see , it 's stepping down and then forward , for your license plate , like so .that way your license plate illumination light will shine down onto your plate .and that 's the law ; your license plate has to be illuminated anytime you drive the trailer .i 'm just going to go ahead and spin off the mounting bolt .slide this through my license plate mounting bracket , like so , make sure not to pinch our wiring , and then mount it on the trailer .just like so .going to install a lock washer , and a retaining nut , spin them down finger tight , i 'm going to install the second lock washer and my second retaining nut .make sure not to pinch our wiring .i 'm going to take my quarter inch socket wrench with the ten millimeter socket .go ahead and snug those up , and there you go .from here , we 're going to g ahead and proceed connecting the wiring in the exact same fashion we did on the other side , with our heat shrink , water proof connectors and our terminal pliers .that is the proper way to remount your license plate bracket and your last rear mount lamp assembly .
all right , the drink we 're about to make is called a rum swizzle .go ahead and put some ice in a glass and measure out two ounces of light rum .you can use a dark rum here as well if you 'd like .and follow that up with the juice of one lime .and also one teaspoon of powdered sugar .and two dashes of bitters .and let 's go ahead and shake that up .make sure you get your powdered sugar dissolved really well in there .and we 've got a collins glass filled with ice , go ahead and pour that in .and we 're just going to top it off with some carbonated water .should get a nice swizzle .all right , quick mix , and we 'll give it a straw and that will be a big bottoms up .
i 'm at break time. [CLS] [SEP]billiards in wilmington , north carolina , and i 'm going to show you how to get out of a spot that you may be left in if your opponent misses or if you happen to play bad position .in this particular case , you put the cue ball in the jaws of the pocket .luckily for you , the other ball is in the jaws of this pocket .now , if there were balls up at that end of the table that would keep you from kicking to that railing coming back , you 're still not dead .you can make this ball by taking and hitting the corner of the rail .the ball will hit , and it will go back across the table , and it will make the two ball .and hopefully , it 's done something like this .and that 's how you do that shot .
accessory 1 turns on your accessories , accessory 2 turns on your auxiliary accessories , accessory 3 will crank the car .once the car cranks and the ignition switch is released to the accessory 2 position , all the vehicle circuits stay on .of course when installing any electronic device such as a radio , automotive security system , remote car starter , you must duplicate what the ignition switch does .so in order for the remote starter to start the vehicle or a radio to come on , it must duplicate accessory 1 and accessory 2 .
when you 're working with animals you have a lot of options on the different poses that you can have them .some dogs are show dogs or whatever , so you definitely want to keep in mind doing the full length , full body shots to show off their shape and their form , and also their markings .but , it also can be great to go in for a close-up on their face , so that you can really see their personality .maybe get them looking when you squeak the toy , or maybe they have a certain trick that they do , that you can really zoom in close and get those details .also , props can be a lot of fun .i always have a whole box of props .some animals really like stuffed animals to play with .or maybe they want to play `` have the bone '' , which can also be great for a fun picture .some toys make noise .if you have a squeaker , that can work really well for both dogs and cats to get their attention and keep their energy up .something else that you can do to help control where the animal is is by setting a table up .probably not too high off the ground , but if you were to put a table up , in this case if you were to throw a white sheet over it , the dog would n't really be able to wander off , they 'd be stuck in that one spot , unless of course they jumped off the table .but this can be really good if you 've got a set setup with your lights and. [CLS] [SEP]you do n't want the animal roaming around a lot .using a table is a good way to restrain their movements without restraining their personality .
so , you learn how to breath , you learn how to warm up , you learn how to warm up your hips , you learn how to stretch , and now you are going to learn how to warm up your chest , you 're top .so , we 're going to make these circle movements .and remember that belly dance is about isolation , muscle isolation .you 're going to go ...only your chest is going to be moving , okay ?you 're going to go , front , side , back , side , front , side , back , side , front , side , back .and if you want to make sure that you 're going to isolate your upper body , you can open your legs and you can tighten your butt , like this to make sure that only your upper body is going to by moving ,okay ?so once again , side , front , side , back , side , front , side , back , side , front , side , back .and you can also warm up your arms with the snake arms .all this before you start. [CLS] [SEP], okay ?and remember to breath .
a long extended brush duster is a great item to have for ceiling fans and lights and hard to reach areas .you still may need a little furniture polish to help collect the dust .beware of heated lights .as some dusters can melt on the lights .these extended dusters are great for cobwebs in corners , on walls , window sills and baseboards .cleaning chandeliers and light fixtures .depending on the fragility of the piece , you can often times using a ceiling fan cleaner to get the dust off .but , to really clean it. [CLS] [SEP]you probably need to get on ladder and use a cloth dampened with a gentle glass cleaner .like one half vinegar and one half water in a spray bottle .be cautious though with the lights .especially if they are hot and on and always clean the chain .
we start out with our arms forward like this .i do a front kick , i pull out my leg to block , do a sidekick low to the knee. [CLS] [SEP]then a stop kick .i shift this leg to a sidekick using the hip to push and then going to a back kick .so again , i have front kick , pull out , sidekick low , stop kick , shift to side kick and back kick .that 's the wing chun chain kick .when you do the chain kicks as you go through the kicking motions .you keep in mind you 're blocking ; stopping kick , which is holding the person as you come in to close in to attack .when you do a stop kick you push the weight from your hips out which is important from your stance .when you do a sidekick , you can also use the bong sao movement .combine the hand movement , the block i showed you earlier , you can do bong sao kick here , which deflects a punch as you stop his leg. [CLS] [SEP]and then you can come in and trap and attack .that 's how you do it .
you 'll find you have many choices of inks or writing fluids if you go to the art store , or even to the stationary store .so i just wanted to mention that there are lots of options for using a dipped pen .you can use a india type ink , you can use a sumi type ink , ( that 's what i happen to be using today )there are art inks that come in different colors ( here 's one here ,this ones from , newton ) .higgings is a big company that makes a lot of different inks , you can use india ink , you can use any ink .i prefer inks that are not waterproof because they do n't dry in the pens , and do n't create as much problem with cleaning the pens .so we 're going to be working. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to be working with fluid ink .and i recommend a black ink rather than a color ink for practicing , because you wo n't worry about the ink density as you 're writing .and sometimes with the colored inks , you see different amount of pigment in each stroke .so get yourself some nice ink , and we 'll get started .
our shrimp pasta salad real quick , real easy .we took some shrimp , we blanched those in a little hot water , put them in a ice bath , took our pasta , cooked our pasta , and then we drained it , rinsed under some cold water to get a lot of the starch off so it would n't stick to each other .we made a dressing a simple dressing with mayo , mustard , seasonings , we added celery , onion , a little bit of garlic , some fresh tomatoes , and then at the end we throw some green onions on top. [CLS] [SEP]and then if you like you can cook you. [CLS] [SEP]some crispy fried bacon to break on top of that , give it a little crunch .and here we have a shrimp pasta salad all done in less then 30 minutes .
we are here talking today about the basics of piano and how this could help to improve your piano playing and you ability to read music .we are going to cover some of the basics and fundamentals of reading the music some of things that go along with that the notes , the different kinds of notes , the key signature the time signature all the things that you need to know to be able to look at and understand what is on the page .first and foremost before you actually sit down to the piano then once we sit down we 'll talk about the different aspects of being able to sit at the piano correctly , being able to find your hand positions , what the notes are , what notes you are looking at. [CLS] [SEP]so you 'll know where to place your fingers and be able to move on .if you take into account all these things hopefully that will give you a better understanding and a more firm grasp of the basics of this which will you to go out there and be able to learn or give you a greater desire to want to learn how to play the piano .
you know , five card draw is not without its many variations .indeed , there are a number of ways to spruce up the game , if you will , and one of the ways that you can change five card draw , is to flip the rules if you will , and how do i mean ?well , you can play lo- ball .that 's basically , flipping the rules , in that , in low ball , when you say , get what looks like a really great hand , it 's not a good hand .for instance , if you had a full house , that would be a horrible hand in lo-ball .you would need to throw that away if it was after the draw , and what 's the worst hand of all in a lo-ball game ?that would be the royal flush .imagine that , it 's the hardest hand to get , and yet , in a lo-ball game , it 's the worst hand possible , so think about that , and let 's move forward. [CLS] [SEP], let 's learn how to play california lo-ball .
alvin dedeaux :okay , so people ask all the time , what is fly fishing ?and basically , fly fishing is using the weighted line to deliver a basically weighted -- weightless fly , and fly fishing is actually one of the oldest forms of fishing .the fly fishing equipment has been around much longer than any other modern type of fishing equipment with the mechanical reels and the monofilament line .those are all fairly modern inventions .nobody is really sure of the origins of fly fishing , but they 're pretty sure it 's been around at least since the 1400s , maybe even sooner .they used bamboo rods back then .now , we use graphite rods , and they used catgut for the actual fly line and leader .actually , silk was used for fly lines for a long time and they used catgut for leaders .now of course , we 're using these modern plastics and monofilaments , but it 's a very ancient form of fishing .so it 's something that 's been around for a long time , and it 's really has n't changed a whole lot since its very beginnings .
alright the drink we are about to make is called the `` casa noble margarita '' .the first thing we 'll do is put some ice in a glass here. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to measure out one shot of casa noble tequila .repasado is the ideal tequila you want to use. [CLS] [SEP]but the fact is it does n't really matter as far as taste goes .which one you use but just since the name is casa noble margarita. [CLS] [SEP]obviously you want to try to use that if you want to be authentic .so one shot. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll also do a half of a shot of gran marnier. [CLS] [SEP], there we go and a half of a shot of lime juice .there we go .finally we are going to add some sour mix or margarita mix and let 's mix this up here .just go back and forth , you do n't need to shake it , there we go .get a glass obviously if you have a margarita glass. [CLS] [SEP]you can salt the rim you can do that. [CLS] [SEP]or you can just serve it up in any kind of glass you have available .there 's that , give it a straw and garnish with a lime. [CLS] [SEP]if you 'd like .bottoms up .
you get a tape measure , have your dog laying down like it would be on a bed and measure your dog to fit comfortably in width .she is about 3 1/2 feet .now that will be a nice bed .
i 'm going to show you how to make a turtle .if you look down here you can see i have a nice square piece of paper and. [CLS] [SEP]what i 'm going to do is i 'm just going to fold it in half , like so. [CLS] [SEP], this is a sheet bend or a shaw bend , however you want to look at it .what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to take these corner pieces. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to fold them up , like so , and do the point , do both sides , there we go .now what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to take and fold this up , fold them both up like that .these are going to be the front legs. [CLS] [SEP]so what we 're going to do is we 're going to take , just kind of fold those out , something like a ninety degree angle or a forty five degree angle towards the diamond shaped edge .now what we 're going to do , which is really going to make this not really a origami much , that 's why i 'm just going to take. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to cut , because cutting is a no , no in origami , i 'm just going to take and kind of split up the center , like so , just so i can create these back legs .so , now that the back legs are created i 'm going to do kind of the same thing i did with the front legs and just kind of fold them out until they stick out a little bit .now , i 'm going to take this corner piece here. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to fold. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to kind of give it a little bit of an angle. [CLS] [SEP]so it kind of angles towards the back of the turtle , just a little bit .i 'll bring this one up the same way , fold his legs out , like so .now , for the head what i 'm going to do is i 'm just going to fold this down. [CLS] [SEP]and then just fold it up just a little bit , make him look like he 's peeking out of his shell .we 'll turn it over , flatten it out a little bit , do n't worry he 'll spring back up , a little bit too much .lets push his head back , there we go .and , there you have it , your origami turtle , play around with it , have fun and enjoy .
okay , in order to work in pro tools , we need to export our project from final cut .let 's take a look at the options that final cut gives us .the first thing we 're going to do is we 're going to export our sequence as a quicktime movie .what that 'll do , it will render all these individual cuts , individual shots that you see here into one quicktime movie .and that 's what we want. [CLS] [SEP], that 's the only thing we 'll be able to work with in pro tools .so we 'll go over to `` file '' , `` export '' , and `` quicktime movie '' .and what they will do is it will give us the choice of where we 're going to put our movie , and what we 're going to call it .in this case , we 'll just call it `` soda movie export '' .a couple of the options we have here , we want to make sure we make a self contained movie , and we 're not going to put any markers in there .we 're going to include the audio and the video , and we 're going to save it to the current settings of our project .i 'm going to go ahead and click `` save '' .we 're going to render a quicktime movie ; this is a short sequence that we use as an example .some projects can be quite large .this particular project is only about a minute and a half .the next step we need to do is we need to export our audio .now , instead of exporting individual tracks as single files , with the omf export , it allows us to export the media that 's contained within the tracks , giving us the ability to import them into pro tools and give us the ability to edit them , just the way they laid out in your tracks here in your final cut .so , what we 're going to do is export the media and the medidata. [CLS] [SEP], that 's the data that tells the audio where to go .so we 're going to go down , export audio to omf , and we 're going to keep it at 48 kilohertz. [CLS] [SEP], that 's our professional standard , and our project is also 16 bit .we also have the ability to put handle links , that 's how much media is going to extend past the end of our cut .so right here on our first cut we have audio that may go beyond this cut. [CLS] [SEP], i might need that for sound editing .so let 's go ahead and click on `` ok '' , we have a one second cross fade handle .we 're going to call it `` soda movie '' , and it 's going to be. [CLS] [SEP]our soda movie omf .and click `` save '' .( we have our computer telling us what time it is ) .so now i 've completed exporting the picture and the audio and i 'm ready to import it into pro tools .
now , something really simple , but let 's make it harder to do .once again , we 're going to go back to a squat as a body weight exercise .i 'm going to show you variations , and how to make this a lot harder with your dumbbells .one of em ' , probably you have n't done before .okay , so we have our basic squat .you all know this .you can add weights anywhere .you can put em ' on your waist , you can take em ' up here , you can add a shoulder press .here is one that 's really hard to do , even with five pounds each .are you ready ?arms are up , slightly in front of you , not behind you ; neck aligned with your spine , and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to squat down and up , and i 'm not going to move anything in my upper body .i am going to keep it really steady .you know what 's working here ?a lot of muscles in my back , my legs are working more ; my core is working , and my shoulders .and , is my heart rate going up ; did my heart rate go up ?yes it did .good one. [CLS] [SEP]; shoulders up , straight up in the air ; get that squat in ; good combination. [CLS] [SEP]
hi in this segment we 're going to be ironing a pair of pants and we 're going to be talking about the preparations for that to begin with .now it might sound silly but the first thing you want to do of course is check the pockets , you do n't want anything in there ; paper , money ; anything like that could be ruined with such high temperatures that you 're ironing with , coins ; anything stuck in there will also ; you could actually iron the imprint of the coin right into your , into your pair of pants and that would n't do you any good now. [CLS] [SEP]would it ?so you also want to check the back pockets. [CLS] [SEP]and then once everything 's checked ,and you know that they 're empty you also want to zip up the pants and button them up .and if there 's hooks , hook them up so that everything , on the back too the buttons on there ; buttons on the front , zip up the zipper so that the pair of pants will be all ready .then the next thing you want to do is. [CLS] [SEP]you just want to spritz the whole pair of pants lightly so that it 'll be damp ; i think that we 've got a pair of pants that are ready to be ironed .
making a triangle can also be a lot of fun .you can simply start in this case we will do a single crocheted triangle and you simply start with one chain , actually it would be two chains .then in the first chain you make two single crochets and you have just completed your first row .you make a chain turning the yarn then you would make two single crochets in each stitch across then you do the chain as you turn the work around and you continue on in this manner until you have triangle that looks something like this .
hi , i 'm kerri at zebra in berkeley , and i 'm here to tell you about what piercings hurt the most .in general , any cartilage piercing is very , very sensitive and does hurt a lot .that 's on the ear , your nose , in addition to cartilage piercings , the most painful piercings are your nipples .nipples are very , very sensitive and actually hurt even more than some of the other piercings downstairs .one way that you can deal with the pain better and or get rid of the pain is by taking some kind of pain reliever before you receive your piercing , usually about a half an hour to an hour before , that will cut down on your pain .also you can use a topological numbing solution .some piercing places offer it and others. [CLS] [SEP]do n't .if the piercing place does not offer a numbing solution , you can usually find one online .
the catch usually is on the back of the card , the printer ’ s logo is on the back. [CLS] [SEP]but it is a way to get cards if you don ’ t mind that .you could always use your favorite search engine and type in the phrase business cards and you will get about a million different answers , results .you would pick those from anywhere in the country and lots of times they have standard templates and layouts and designs all right there online .it makes it easy for you to order the cards. [CLS] [SEP]and you get those probably relatively quickly within a few days .the next thing you could do is you could support your local economy and go to a local print shop or a copy shop or you could go to a large chain office supply store .they usually have printing services available .if you want to start spending some pretty good money , you can hire a graphic designer that way they will come up with some very unique card for you and as in any hobby there are always specialists .you can get alternative materials like wood , metal , glass and leather .there is a company that makes comic books super hero type cards based on a photograph that you send to them of yourself and they turn into a super hero and finally on a really high-end , there are cards marketed solely to the jet set crowd ; folks who are for instance selling multi-million dollar real estate or mega yacht .these cards really offer people who want to standout from the crowd and differentiate themselves by the high status of their cards .
so this super complicated dial , knob , over hear .so , the way to break this one down , so you 've got normal , you 've got permanent press , you 've got short , and you 've got prewash , and then you 've got all this other regular. [CLS] [SEP]what not .basically , the only one i 've ever used in my life is the normal one over here .because it 's normal. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm normal. [CLS] [SEP]i guess .you 've got , and what 's cook about the normal. [CLS] [SEP]is it breaks it down super simple .because normal one is like ,alright. [CLS] [SEP]so we take this knob , and i turn it over to. [CLS] [SEP], i find my normal , i 've got am heavy ?am i regular ?or am , it 's just like fourteen , ten , or six .so heavy , regular , and whatnot .and , what 's great about normal is you just go , ``well , i do n't really care , so. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to go normal , regular . [CLS] [SEP]''and then you pop it on , and it 's going to go through. [CLS] [SEP]it 's whole cycle and will take like , probably a half hour ,whatever .and then it goes through , like it fills up with the water , and then it rinses it , and then it spins and gets all the water out , and then it gets to the off .then from there , like permanent press , short , and pre-wash , i honestly do n't use that much .so , if you want to know about those you 're going to have to call the whirlpool association .
now `` insert bypass '' basically allows you to bypass any insert by clicking this `` edit bypass '' button .this basically allows you to click on any type of effect whatever and allows you to bypass just with a click of that button .when i look at right here. [CLS] [SEP]i could look at my my compressor at the top as i press the button you can see that the bypass turns on and off .so not only can i affect the different parameters within the plug-in. [CLS] [SEP], i can also bypass any plug-in from my board just from there , you know what i 'm saying ?i could also take different ; i could add plug-ins remove plug-ins and side chain different plug-ins depending on where i 'm at .when doing these it 's very important that you know that you have to press this `` edit bypass '' button before you do anything else .if you want to affect the different parameters and change the different settings within the plug-in you just have to click on. [CLS] [SEP]the `` plug-in '' button within this control panel but when you want to bypass you want to make sure you hit the `` edit bypass '' button first .
so , today were going to go over a `` d '' flat major scale .which is this nice simple pattern .and were really going to get this pattern under our fingers .and what 's great about it is you can play it off of any fret .so , i can start here , and i can even move it down to a lower fret , and i can move it up a higher fret .so , were going to take this scale and really show you how to utilize it and run it through. [CLS] [SEP]and , there 's two other chords. [CLS] [SEP], you got two .if you start on the second degree of the scale , you get a minor scale , right ?so , if when we first started here , now if you start here , you get a minor scale , and if you start on a fifth degree , one , two , three , four , five , you get a seventh scale .so , were going to go through and show you how to get these patterns under your fingers , and once you have the patterns down. [CLS] [SEP]and you know the names of all the scales. [CLS] [SEP], we going to through and analyze a chart in `` d '' flat , were going to go through and show you how to move these scales around and by utilizing these different route notes you can play through a simple , jazz tune , or , a latin tune , or , a funk tune , and just really get all these chord changes , and all this theory under your fingers rather quickly , just by utilizing this one major scale .
now there are occasions where you can close with something that word for word repeats what you said at the very beginning .it 's still important that it 's going to be different .it 's going to come across different , i should say , of how you came across the beginning .but i 'll show you this example .this an example of this piece that says , no one told me i could write .not a shoelace of instruction of how to tie on these magic sandals of flight .now the whole piece deals with this struggle of that i do n't feel like i 'm qualified to become a writer .watch how i close it by saying the very exact same words that i started with .i will fly not deny prophecy to my nation under ration of vulnerable wit and joking tragedies of gruesome grit are you down with it ?man it does n't matter a bit to me because i know who sees and is pleased with my personality .he gets every accolade that may come my way .it 's his boldness that has freed me from every fear and regulation today .man , no one told me that i could write .
what you want to do is take your file and your finger. [CLS] [SEP]and you are actually going to file from the corner to the center , from the corner to the center , corner to the center , corner to the center. [CLS] [SEP], you do not want to go back and forth .take from that corner to the center and go from the corner to the center , on the corner to the center .if you go side to side , back and forth like a saw you can rip the nail down the center and you don ’ t want to do that .so you want to take it from the corner to the center .that is how you file male nails .
o.k .now that we 're working in this very close area , i put on my magnifiers so that i can see better what 's going on and basically we are going to refine that upper lip a little bit by just doing some fine shaping around this little area here .now one of the things that 's pretty important. [CLS] [SEP]you 're going have to exaggerate the critical depths when we 're carving .more so than with the real human being because this little sculpture has to read well in one color , we do n't have natural lipstick , so we will often just refine it in such a way that we cut everything a little deeper than reality .and exaggerate the three dimensional character and we 'll have this upper lip is now starting to take a much more realistic look now that i have started to shape these two intersections of that upper lip .much better and look at much more finer definition and beginning to look like a human being .
alright you want to start by cleaning your wheel head off from the last project .start with a nice clean wheel head .and then we 've got about two pounds of clay , you can just wedge it right there on your wheel head .going to move it back and forth , alright .make sure your back 's on there .and get this nice and wedged up , just like that .alright now that you got your ball of clay ready to roll , just kind of find the center .i think it already is in the center ,yeah .you want to seal it to your wheel head , and by doing this you make sure that it does n't fly across the studio when you 're trying to center it .so just take your finger and just seal it right down there .if you have a plastic bat , make sure it 's nice and dry before you put it on there because it 'll never get stuck .there you go .now we 're going to center this guy .
a road cyclist are the individuals , and maybe even teams , you see on the road .a lot of them are racers .they 're in tuck position a lot of times on their dropped bars , those are the curled down kinda bars .mountain bikers , those are the guys riding the bikes that have the shocks on the front and sometimes on the back , and smaller wheels , and they are usually dirty from riding in the dirt .then you have the comfort and hybrid cyclist and they 're the guys who like the feel of a mountain bike frame. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's got all the road components on it .now what 's the best bike for you ?you know first of all i think you need to decide what price range you want to go ahead ...and what kinda money you want to spend on it .so once you decide that , you go ahead and go out and test drive all the cyclist , all the bikes you can in that price range .be prepared to spend 10 percent maybe more or less than what your price range is .okay. [CLS] [SEP]and then once you 've test driven go out and by the bike , get the one that is most comfortable for you .that 's the way you want to do it .
ok , this is one of the cones that i made i prefer working with a cone then out of a bottle .for a couple of reasons for one its a little closer to the more ancient way that they used to do it .bottles have become traditional in the last , you know probably fifty years .sense. [CLS] [SEP]they 've had them .i like to make my own cones i work better with a cone i find i have better manipulation with them .but if you like a bottle thats fine to just go to any craft store and you can get bottles with needles the have little different tip needles in there .i have a hard time getting the lids to stay attached and not sink into the henna .so i just , i just prefer this all the way around .there very easy to make .well i did mylar. [CLS] [SEP]is whats kind of recommend. [CLS] [SEP]i found this at the dollar store its a bag its kind of mylar like .its thicker that cellophane sturdy and your going to find it works out. [CLS] [SEP]real good. [CLS] [SEP]you just going to need like a thin plastic or mylar. [CLS] [SEP]is what your looking for .ok ?so your going to find that any kind of a gift wrapping department generally .thats what i recommend .
there is also another move you can use .it is the spin move .it is a real good move too .come here mikey .it is real simple and it 's a real simple move. [CLS] [SEP]and it helps makes pretty big plays .i like to use it to because it is real simple .this is how it goes .come on mikey ; just simple .if you do it right , there is a 100 percent chance you are going to miss ; just simple .
this is called the `` bronx silver cocktail '' .go ahead and start off with putting your ice in your glass like so. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to do a half an ounce of dry vermouth , la , la , la. [CLS] [SEP], in it goes .now we are going to do an ounce of gin , any type of gin will do , pick your favorite .now we are going to do an egg white like so. [CLS] [SEP], that is right. [CLS] [SEP]no yolk to this one .mix it up really good together because you have egg whites in there. [CLS] [SEP]and it is pretty thick and you want it all to get crazy mixed. [CLS] [SEP], that 's right , crazy mixed .after you mix the egg white up. [CLS] [SEP]you want to throw the orange juice in. [CLS] [SEP]and we talk about that. [CLS] [SEP]a little bit like so. [CLS] [SEP]and this is what your `` bronx silver cocktail '' is going to look like .go ahead and garnish that with an orange slice and a little cocktail straw. [CLS] [SEP]and you are on your way .cheers .
in your swimming workouts , you should emphasize interval training .perhaps more than in any other discipline .that 's the most effective way to train in the pool .so , blocks of hundreds , two hundreds , pyramids where you build fifties , one hundred , one hundred and fifty , two hundred maybe even up to three hundred and then back down are very effective .another effective training method , perhaps once a week or once every two weeks is to do a time trial a four hundred , five hundred or eight hundred meters timed to kind of measure progress .the basic guideline for intervals in swim training is to have between two and three work to one rest ratio .so , for example , if i could swim one hundred in one fifteen off the wall and repeat that effort , i could a group of hundreds , say eight by one hundred for a starting work out perhaps building up to as many as fifteen by one hundred on an interval of one forty five .so , i 'd have a working time of about one minute ,fifteen seconds. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'd have a rest period of about thirty seconds. [CLS] [SEP]so that 's about a two and half to one ratio , so. [CLS] [SEP]that 's about right .as the intervals get longer , if you 're two hundreds or three hundreds , which are especially applicable if you 're doing half iron man distance or longer , the work interval shrinks a bit .
all right .last two aspects of kind of the anatomy of an accordion is there will be a strap that your hand kind of slips in. [CLS] [SEP]and this is how you 're able to actually compress the bellows and squeeze the bellows and pull it out without -- and able to use those fingers at the same time .and these straps can often be -- have a way to tighten them through a little kind of dial like this .and i 've got other accordions here and every single one of them has a little tightening dial there to kind of tighten that strap on your hand .i 'll set this one down and you can see this one .again , it 's the same thing .here are our closure straps ; here 's our strap tightening dial ; here 's our hand strap .this one does n't have as many bass buttons as that one did but -- bellows , keyboard , bass keyboard .this one does n't have any bass reed bank selector switches but it does have two piano bank selector switches , so. [CLS] [SEP]basically the same .here , the straps again , they go over your shoulders , kinda like a reverse backpack .i 'll show you how that 's done .so that 's basic anatomy .there 's one last thing i want to show you though. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'll show that to you in the next clip .
in this clip what we 're going to show you is. [CLS] [SEP]the kick serve or the top spin serve and how to use this effectively to be more consistent .also , to use it sometimes for a first serve .it 's just that spin serve that gives you more margin of error .also , makes the ball jump up high to your opponent .a lot of times the back end side , your real effective serve .this is gustavo sanchez right here .he has a really huge second serve .he 's not warmed up yet .he 's going to show you the basics , the idea of it .what we 're going to do is we 're going to show you how he 's contacting the ball .along the lines with the slice , how we went to the edge to the edge of the racket of the ball .you 're going to do the same thing , but you 're going to come up this way .basically going from 6 to 12.brush up and still throwing your racket out .throw your racket up to the ball .very important , again .going to the edge .he 's going to show you kind of in half motion of how you would even approach this .gustavo is going to hit a couple of serves here .see how he 's going up on the ball .he 's brushing up .he still pronates a little bit or turns the racket in .also look and see where he 's finishing .the racket is coming around to the side and he 's throwing his racket in this direction .almost like he 's throwing it to the side of the court .that 's the idea on this kick serve .we slice serve we went around this way .the kick serve you have to get it over your head a little more and go up .will you hit a slice and then a kick serve .gustavo is going to show you a slice .see where the toss is .the toss is a little more out to the right .now he 's going to show you the kick serve .notice where the kick serve toss is .very important to be able to locate that toss and that direction for your kick serve .
they sell it in every grocery store they have just the creo seasoning mix that you can find anywhere. [CLS] [SEP]and you can use that .so we got our seasonings in a bowl. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to mix that up. [CLS] [SEP]and here we have a seasoning that we going to use. [CLS] [SEP]like i say on the chicken and on the flour that we 're going to dredge the chicken in ,so lets move on .
we chilled it while we were waiting for our lasagna .take a look at this baby , look at that , does n't that look beautiful .look how beautiful it is !i put some fresh basil on top. [CLS] [SEP]it smells and looks terrific. [CLS] [SEP]and i know because of the no boil noodles , it 's going to be still nice and light. [CLS] [SEP]and now i 'm going to plate this .take a nice healthy slice of it there is three sets of layers of sauce , noodles and cheese. [CLS] [SEP]and you know see there 's still a lot of steam coming out of there. [CLS] [SEP]but i did let this sit for about 20 minutes. [CLS] [SEP]and it makes it much easier to slice and serve because of the cheeses and sauce. [CLS] [SEP]do n't go running out .add a helping of caesar salad right next to it , this would be a terrific dish for a family gathering. [CLS] [SEP]it does n't have to be special. [CLS] [SEP]it could be a tuesday night .because we use some short cuts , i toasted some bread and here we have it. [CLS] [SEP], super lasagna with caesar salad on behalf of expert village , i 'm laura banford and i enjoyed making this dish for you see you next time .
and in this series i 'd like to just take you around the studio and show you what would be available for someone to use at a gym .all of this equipment would be fantastic for someone to use in an adaptive program .but i 'm also then going to show you where you might be able to just use it at your home .so if you look around. [CLS] [SEP]we 've got lots of nice equipment that anyone can use .great machines that work for all types of core training and exercise therapy and functional movement patterns .so we just looked around the studio at a lot of this equipment that might be a little challenging for someone with a disability to use .you have treadmills and such things that require movement that someone might not be able to have .but i 'd like to show you a couple of these simple little devices right here .you can perform all kinds of exercises .and the most wonderful thing about things like this is this can be performed at home .this of course can be done in a very professionally guided studio just as this .with simple little balls such as these there 's a whole world of exercises with exercise and pilates adaptive type movements .
now one of the best things to use are these connectors here and you can buy these connectors and they 're rated at different pounds that they 'll hold and this particular one will hold up to about 150 pounds per attach point .and all it is is basically just a heavy threaded screw and one thing that 's nice about it. [CLS] [SEP]is you do n't have to pre-drill for it .so what we do is once we locate where our two centers are then all we need to do. [CLS] [SEP]is just get this started and use a phillips head screwdriver. [CLS] [SEP]and you just , it threads into your drywall. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to thread it down just till it 's snug .and like i said , these are rated at a very high amount of force that it takes to pull them out of the wall so with two of them , you get a very secure attach point .and then one thing on your pictures , pictures or mirrors , is you want to make sure that it has some kind of either a chain such as this or that is has a wire , picture wire , in the back of it .so once you put these up , then all we need to do is to reach up and to hook our mirror and get it centered and that 's all there is to it .and now with that up there , we know we got a nice secure installation .so i 'm tim gipson and that 's how to hang heavy objects .
this one here has got a nice even dark green texture .they 've been waxed so you 'll see the shininess .you 'll want to wash that off when you get home .but the nice green color from end to end is perfect .this is an english cucumber , so its going to be a little bit lighter , but again you have an even color from end to end .what you do n't want to see , is you do n't want to see something like this .now , granted size really does n't matter in this case .this is not a pickling cucumber , its just a little bit smaller .but , things like that seem to be pretty obvious to me .a little less obvious might be where it dimples in and wrinkles .its dried up .and really all a cucumber is , is its moisture .so if you do n't have that moisture , you do n't have the crisp .and you end up getting a bitterness in the end .and lastly i think its really important , again , we 've talked about it all ready .ice .a grocery stores best friend , maybe not yours .if this is stored directly on ice , whether its in your home or in the grocery store , all of these water crystals or water molecules that are in the cucumber are going to freeze .and when they freeze , they are going to thaw back out. [CLS] [SEP]and they get mushy .so be careful on how the cucumbers are stored .and make sure again , what you want to see is something a little more like this .
first abdominal exercise we are going to do is the basic crunch .all you 'll need is your towel , or if you 're at home you can do this on the floor , on carpet , i prefer carpet .go ahead and start on your back .knees are bent at about a ninety degree angle .you 're comfortable .and first what i 'm going to do is show you your basic , basic crunch .you 're going to start with your hands right at your temples , you 're not holding on behind your head because you 're more likely to pull on your head and neck muscles .by holding on just right at your temples you 're less likely to pull on your neck and more likely to use your abdominal muscles .so your basic crunch is going to involve keeping your feet flat on the floor , and you 're going to think about lifting your shoulder blades up off of the floor , tightening your abdominal muscles , bringing your ribs in towards your hips .you 're going to hold for about a two second count and lower back down to the ground .going to lift and lower .i recommend that you just go straight over your knees .i 'm going to show you a couple variations .to increase the intensity , you can bring your feet up off the floor , keep your feet side by side or crossed , ninety degree then .and once again , lift shoulder blades off the floor , tightening , holding , and lowering down .now you do not want to completely lower down and rest , you want to keep those muscles contracted .so i only recommend lowering down a couple of inches .lift up , hold , tighten and lower down .the last variation which is the most challenging is keeping your feet completely straight , or keeping your legs completely straight .up toward the ceiling , and again do n't pull on the head , and lower down .tighten those ab muscles , bring the ribs in towards the hips , lower down .if you do your abdominal muscle , if you do your ab exercises correctly , it 's quality over quantity .so you should n't have to do a hundred or two hundred reps to feel these ab exercises effectively .
hello .i 'm stevie moore .welcome to my studio at the artist 's attic in lexington , kentucky .now i 'd like to explain to you a little bit about some of the brushes we are going to be using today for our wooded scene in oil .there 's three factors , three attributes that every brush has that you need to take into account when selecting it and using it .first would be size .second would be shape of the brush .and the third would be the size of the bristles of the brush .the first types of brushes that we have are going to be our square brushes .and i have several sizes of square brushes .i have a large , fine bristle .and i have two different sized mediums .and i have a very interesting flat brush , that has sort of a mitered cut on it , it 's also good for detailing .and then a small , stubbier flat brush .these , all these brushes have fine bristles .soft and smooth bristles are good for glazing .they are good for moist strokes with very wet , thin paint .they do n't hold as much paint as a stiffer bristled brush and they also do n't give as much texture as a stiff bristle brush .these two brushes i have here are two different shaped brushes that i now use for dry brushing .this is sort of a medium bristled , and this is a very , very soft , plastic bristled brush .this is actually a water color brush .it 's very good for dry brushing and blending , which we 'll see later in the painting .these are my round brushes and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going mainly use for line work and detail work .i 've got two larger ones and then i 've got three of different sizes and shapes .one that ?s. [CLS] [SEP]a , basically , a very small square brush , and. [CLS] [SEP]then i have two round brushes here that i 've selected for fine detail work .i 'm going use some stiff bristled brushes .i 've got three here .i 've got a square that is large in size .i 've got a square that is medium in size with coarse bristles .and i 've got a square that is rounded , and not just rounded. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's almost cone-shaped .these are good for texturing and for building up layers of paint , and also good for doing a lot of dotted work .we 'll see a technique that i 'll use in this painting .i 've got two different sizes fan brushes .i 've got a medium and a large fan brush .these can hold a lot of paint , but they also are very selective in where they place the paint on the canvas .you can do some interesting tricks with fan brushes as well .then i have to two liner brushes , used for making lines .a couple of other tools that i 'll be using today are two types of palette knives .i 've got a large palette knife and a small palette knife .they 're metal palette knives .and it 's always good to have a razor blade handy .and of course , you 'll need some type of pencil , be it charcoal , graphite ,the lighter the better because it 's going to mix in with your paint .you do n't want too much pigment mixing in .and an eraser is always good to have when we actually go into the drawing , which we 're going to do next on our canvas .
okay , we 're going to talk to you about the recovery and where to recover .and making sure that you are in the right position on the court .a lot of times , you , you 'll find players that will hit their shot , kind of spectate , look at it , love it and not quite get back ready for the next shot again .you know , this is ball that you 're not really going to come forward on. [CLS] [SEP]or you really can come forward and approach on. [CLS] [SEP], it 's that little bit of a shorter ball and then have to get back and not get caught in that no man 's land area .so let 's show you what common players will do .fairly short , i 'll give you a shorter one again .here you go .loving it .and then , shorter ball .here again no shorter ball , now shorter ball .looks at it .how about this ?and a little bit out of position for that shot , because he watched his shot a little bit too long .now let 's show you what you want to do .you want make sure that you hit and go .you , you can watch your shot , as you 're coming back and recovering .people do n't know that .people will just watch their shot in the same spot .so he has a shorter ball right here. [CLS] [SEP]and then he gets back .and look , he 's ready for the next shot .good .good .let 's do that again , looks so good. [CLS] [SEP]let 's do it again .and he goes again , see that ?so gustavo , were you watching your shot as you came back ?no !he was n't .he was n't spectating .but he was able , but he 's able to see it right ?right .alright , here we go .let 's do it again .shorter ball right there .and he 's still wide ,yeah .very nice .you just hit and go .you make sure that you 're not sitting there and watching your shot .very important to hit , move back , recover right away .
now take these chicken salami pieces , which you can easily get from the market .now we need to chop these pieces .place this on the slice , sprinkle some onion , fine chopped onion , fine chopped tomato , some green chili .you can even add some capsicum .and then sprinkle some pepper and salt , as per your taste .and then cover this with another slice of bread and then place it on the toaster and leave it for three to four minutes .so , now after four minutes , your toast is ready .so let 's see .now we take this toast , since it 's properly toasted , place it on a plate. [CLS] [SEP]and then we can have it with either tomato ketchup or maybe mustard sauce , as per your wish .so here you go , your toast is ready .
now we 're going to show you a great exercise for your legs and your butt .these are called step ups .naturally , you can at any place you 've got a step .if you 're in your house , nice small step .if you want a challenge , then get a chair out .just make use a piece of furniture is not going to fall down when you step up on it .so what you 're going to do is keep your torso straight up and down. [CLS] [SEP]and then just like it says , step up .so amy 's going to show you right now .she 's stepping up and stepping back down , with the right foot .you want to lead with the same foot with the amount of repetitions that you do .i recommend that you work up to doing thirty repetitions on each side .for example , amy 's going to step up on her right foot thirty times .and then she would step over the left foot thirty times .that might be a challenge , so start out with any amount of reps that works for you .it might be three on the right side and three on the left side .then , if this becomes too easy , hold something in your hands .the more weight that you hold , the harder the exercise becomes .once again , this is a great exercise , you can do it any place , anywhere .the only thing to make sure is if this bothers your knees or your lower back , then it 's the wrong exercise for you .otherwise , put this in and your legs are going to be looking good .
hi .i 'm amy erinberger and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm a commercial model in portland , oregon with option model management. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to tell you about some funny moments i 've had in modeling .one of my most interesting jobs i got booked for was when i was sixteen years old. [CLS] [SEP]i was hired to do a maternity magazine. [CLS] [SEP]and i had to wear the stuffed belly on every shoot we did all day long ,and i thought it was kind of interesting that they wanted a sixteen year old to look pregnant all the time ,but i guess i fit. [CLS] [SEP]that look that they were looking for. [CLS] [SEP]so i did n't question it .another more recent job i had was for a freight liner , which is a trucking company , and they wanted a sexy trucker , i guess , so they hired a model. [CLS] [SEP]and i kind of wore khaki pants that were tight , but looked like a trucker. [CLS] [SEP]and we shot outside of burgerville. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's what the client wanted as well. [CLS] [SEP]so i did n't question it , but to me it was kind of an odd job , and those are my funniest moments in modeling .
now we 're going to be talking about the movement on the serve .before you start the serve , you want to establish a routine .i like to bounce the ball a couple of times just to think of what i 'm going to be doing .then i prepare my toss by putting the ball under the neck of my racket .i like to do it in three steps , it makes it simple .so one , it 's going to be starting with the shoulders looking to the side of the court , head looking to where you are going to be pointing the ball and your opponent .bring the racket about this area .you can bring it a little more down if you want to , just the purpose is that you bring it farther away than your knees so that you can keep your shoulders open instead of like. [CLS] [SEP]just that looking over there , so that 's the main objective .open your shoulders .you bend your elbow over here .so that 's going to be step number two and. [CLS] [SEP]step number three is going to be , toss your ball , weight on the left part of your body and final step , pass your weight to your right side of the body , left hand down , right hand up and go forward , finish your shot , racket on your left side ,let your body stop your hand. [CLS] [SEP]and if you want you can step in the court once you have hit the shot and that 's the basics of the serve .
this clip is about snoots , snoots are an actual addition to your strobes that just clip on , and different ones clip on different ways .this one has three spring clips that make it easy to go on and off .what it is , is it actually channels the light down from a big broad light source to a very narrow one .it gives you a lot more control over your light ; it maintains the circular shape of the light .it 's really nice , so if you wanted to like go in and put just like an extra light on someone 's face or a product that 's in amongst other products so you can highlight that product separately .they are real easy to use , they are fairly inexpensive , they do get hot , if you leave the modeling light on your strobe , if you leave it on all the time , then when you take this off , it 's going to burn your hands because it will absorb the heat from the modeling light .when you purchase a snoot , keep in mind that it has to fit on the size of the reflector that comes with your , with your strobe head .there are different size reflectors and different size snoots .just because one 's a seven inch snoot , it may not go on a seven inch reflector from another manufacturer. [CLS] [SEP], it depends on the lip here ,so you kind of keep , kind of have to stay with the manufacturer of your lights , as also the manufacturer of your snoot .
okay , you could start from the feet together , fist to hip position .okay , you want to step out in a horse stance .okay .now , the twisting punch , you twist in a bow , and you throw the punch straight out with your shoulders in a line .you want to keep the chest straight , the buttocks tucked in , front thigh parallel , back leg straight .now , in the twisting punch you perform two actions .okay .twisting with the sleeve block and then executing the second punch .okay .you want to do it at the same time ,so you block , shift , and then punch straight out .okay , from the side view .okay , you notice the shoulders are in a line , front leg is parallel , then he blocks straight up , twists , punch .then again , blocks straight up , twists and punch .now , it 's very important as you perform the blocking and the punch , that you stay level , so that way you have the proper distance for the punch. [CLS] [SEP]and you do n't compromise your power .okay .some common applications for the twisting punch , if someone hooks to your head , so you 've sleeve block straight out , and at the same time , punch to the ribs or to the chest .okay .or if they punch straight to the chest this way , you just twist , block straight up , punch to the armpit , punch to the ribs , okay .and also if they punch , you can block , punch straight to the face .but it 's very important , you do n't want to throw a block , and then stop and then punch .so it 's perform at the same time , block , punch .if he punches again , block , punch .that is the proper way to perform a twisting punch .
in this clip i 'm going to be showing you some weapons that we 're going to be fighting with .this is our dagger .it has , there are a few different parts to a dagger .you 've got your hilt , which is everything below here .so this would be the handle. [CLS] [SEP], you 've got your knuckle guard , and then you 've got your pommel .above the hilt you have your blade , the , the point is right over here .the weakest part of the blade is called the foible , that 's this guy over here , probably from here out .mid-blade , and then you 've got your forte , which is the strongest part of the blade .it does n't matter as much with those three things with the dagger because it 's all pretty strong , but once you get into a rapier , then you have a different story .you do n't really want to attack with your foible as much , because it 's not as strong , if you , if you 're doing cut .you want to try and hit with , with your forte because then you have more , more power behind it .the , the rapier works the same way .you 've got everything here to here is called your hilt .you 've got your knuckle guard , knuckle bow , you 've got your handle , and you 've got your pommel .and it works the same way with your blade .you 've got your foible , mid-blade , and forte .and then you have , if you look , anything on the side of your knuckle bow , this is our true edge .this is what you 're going to be cutting with most of the time .and then on the opposite side you have your false edge .and those are our weapons that we 're going to be using today .
and one thing i might have done there would be to pre-wet the pearlite to avoid breathing any of that dust .and now that i have my mix somewhat completed i 'm going to go ahead and wet it and mix it using this spade fork , excellent mixing tool .it 's almost like mixing concrete , if you 've done that .just trying to create a blend and begin to suss out what out , what our final needs are here .there are several other things i might add .this is some green sand minerals .nope , that 's finished compost , excuse me , organic compost .we can inoculate that with some organic compost that someone else has made .and over here we have mineral called green sand , which is mined in new jersey , and the green sand adds micronutrients to the mix .some people would say with a good compost that 's unnecessary .and now we 're getting close to finished , and i 'm going to either hand or tool. [CLS] [SEP]mix the final batch until it 's to my satisfaction .sometimes we 'll add and blend different batches of compost , so there 's no such thing as a perfect recipe .we go by intuition and then we observe the results .
at this point it 's up to you if you want to adjust the how much heat you want in there , me i like to push it up so were mixing that heat in with our red , yellow , green bell pepper , onion , celery , holy trinity .our herbs parsley basil , thyme , and. [CLS] [SEP]we used fresh herbs shrimp and pork , some garlic , green onions , and as we continue to mix each layer gets mixed even more so into our mixture .so we want this to be spread throughout everything and once again once this is totally put together were going to move it and push it right through our meat grinder .get it to the consistency that we want for our sausage this looks good right here. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll move on .
an alternative to face plates and drive center for holding your work and driving it are what they call a four jaw scroll chuck .what these chucks do is contract or expand all 4 jaws at one time .this particular model works through the use of a single key .a similar model , this one works off a system of pins where you put the 2 levers in and by holding one and moving the other you can open and contract the jaws .the advantage of these systems are that the jaws are interchangeable .you can go from working with a jaw as small as these up to putting on a face plate .these are called a coal type jaw for holding bowls .this type jaw is used for holding long items up to a foot long without support on the lathe and you also have a set of jaws here that will hold a number of different types of diameters of wood .
i have my cornbread out. [CLS] [SEP]it took 10 minutes. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's cooling over there for a little bit .i have my celery and onion chopped up in the bowl .now i 'm just pulling the turkey off and. [CLS] [SEP]this , you are going to have to roll up your sleeves and get your hands a little messy .i 'm just going to peel off piece by piece. [CLS] [SEP]and you just want to pull it apart and put it into our big giant bowl .these are going to be pieces of meat , there are going to be inter mixed with the dressing .so you do n't want huge chunks of it , you know , but it doesn ?t have to be shredded .you do n't have to start chopping things or. [CLS] [SEP]no knives needed right now , just start pulling it off .i will use the entire turkey here , except whenever i get hungry and eat .sometimes i get really hungry in the process of making this. [CLS] [SEP]and i just start eating the turkey .so , depending on how much you want actually in the dressing , do n't eat too much of it .but , you know , everybody needs a snack sometime .so just keep pulling this off until you finish the entire turkey .i do pull the skin off ; i do n't put the skin in here with it .just , you know , skin is really unhealthy and really fattening , so why ?you are not really going to be able to taste the difference anyway , because everything is together in the bowl .so just take the skin off .i 'm going to finish pulling this. [CLS] [SEP]and we are just trucking right along adding all our ingredients into our big bowl here .
and what you want to do is figure out how big your door step is so that when you make your frame , it will fit your rug to go in front of your door .and what we want to do then is get some l connectors at the hardware store and screws and if you do n't have a saw , you want to get a saw and maybe a little sandpaper .and you want to cut two short pieces and two long pieces .you want to make sure that they 're about this much bigger than the rug you want to make so. [CLS] [SEP]you have plenty of room to work .and you also want two nice thick dowels .you can see how thick this is .it 's about at thick as my finger or a little thicker than my thumb .and those you want to cut just a little smaller than the inside of the frame once you make it .but as long as you make these two pieces the same size and these two pieces the same size and remember to put the same ones on the inside so both fit , you will get a nice rectangular frame .
now , we just discussed a minor second interval .this would be a major second interval .now , going back to the major scale , as we just took a look at , the major scale is whole step , whole step , half step , whole step , whole step , whole step , half step .so , if we start from g again and you go up a whole step , and another whole step , we 're going to stop there for a minute and just look at the distance from the first note in a major scale to the second note in a major scale. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's where we get the definition for a second , going from the first note to the second note in a major scale .before , we lowered that by a half step to make this a minor second .now , you can do that anywhere on the neck .the concept comes from the major scale , but you do n't necessarily have to think of it as always being a major scale .anywhere on the neck , one note up two frets , is going to be a major second interval .one note up a half step is going to be a minor second interval .
one more combination upper and lower body exercise is going to be a leg extension with an external rotation of the upper body so create your loop , place it around your ankle , tighten it up , step on the tube ,ball of the foot is on the floor , tighten the hip of the leg you are standing on but keep the knee soft .you are going to be doing a hip extension exercise and with the arm external rotation .external rotation is good for anyone who plays softball .we do a lot of internal rotation in our regular daily life. [CLS] [SEP]so we want things that are going to take us in the opposite direction. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm going to hold down on the tube , lift it by bringing my elbow in , we 're doing knee extension to strengthen the quadriceps. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm doing a little bit of external rotation .now the line of pull is not the greatest for this exercise but it will work in your external rotation , knee extension quadriceps , back of the shoulder , rotator cuff and a great strengthener for anything with external rotation .
so if you 're going through on the internet , you 're going to see this all over the place .so we 're going to start here. [CLS] [SEP]and you 'll see we have our four strings. [CLS] [SEP]so you can really go through and look at the tab .so here is your top string going down to the -- your lowest string here .remember we started on our 2nd fret on our lowest string , so you have -- here we have our 2nd fret , 4th fret ,1st fret , 2nd , 4th , 1st , 3rd ,4th .and then we have 1 , 3 , 4 above it as well .so we have 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7.those are our scale intervals .so our 7 's --or our 1 's is right here .so we have 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4.so again these are the fret -- actual fret markings .now , i 'm just going through the same scale degrees as we count it off 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 1 -- or 5 , 6 , 7 , 1.so go through and get that scale under your fingers. [CLS] [SEP]and you really want to memorize it and get those different intervals down : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7. [CLS] [SEP], 1 in g flat major .
many people hear of tangrams in the classroom .that 's the first exposure they have to the puzzle .tangrams works well in the classroom because it demonstrates proportions and ratios , it also teaches about shapes .you have right triangles. [CLS] [SEP]and then you can measure the area of those triangles , and square , and the parallelogram .tangram puzzles also teach problem solving skills .when i played it in school we got prizes for getting them done the fastest , extra credit and candy .that 's a very good incentive .to do this exercise very inexpensively go ahead and have each student make their own tangram set with a sheet of paper .you can find free tangram puzzles online .so it 's good to just print those out and project them .
we 're going to be focusing on a hand technique called rear uppercut .the rear uppercut is a close-in technique , starting from a high position , going low and punching upward .mainly this is either thrown to the body or to the head .i 'll demonstrate it at normal speed for you , then i 'll have melissa demonstrate it a little bit slower to point out some details .again in my position , my body is nice and loose .now , not forcing anything , i 'm going to row my body slightly to the right .my right hand is going to drop. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to bend my knees , loading my legs up. [CLS] [SEP]and my weight comes from right hand , from right leg , boom , up to left leg .at normal speed .okay .i 'll have. [CLS] [SEP]melissa come forward and demonstrate it for you .so she 's in her stance , the body is loose , hands are in high guard .now the mechanics , to load the punch , she 's going to twist in slightly to the direction , she 's going to sink on the legs .this hand , a lot of times people bring the arm way like this , out down and up .we do n't want to go so big with the motion .so she does the shift twist , this hand just drops this way , rolls and right into the punch . [CLS] [SEP]`` stay there for a moment melissa '' .weight is on the forward leg , inside the foot .to make the punch strong , you 're going to twist your pinkie finger a little bit more toward you than naturally .this is going to really push your first two knuckles out , so penetrating as yo throw that punch .`` one more time nice and slow melissa '' .twist , drop , lift .shoulders can be level .we can say very low or in the mid position between .you 're concentrating on here .again , we want to feel the body throw the punch , up from the leg , hip , shoulder , the fist. [CLS] [SEP], okay .again , you do n't want to pop too much on your shoulder , lifting it , but you want to feel the body throw the punch .one more , rear uppercut .this is rear uppercut for kickboxing .
it 's really simple .these are haas avocados. [CLS] [SEP]the haas are the smaller ones with the pebbly skin , there is another kind that is much bigger and light green .these are the dark ones almost black there is a give to the flesh and that is how you know it 's ripe .so i have three of those a couple of jalepanos for heat , a little bit of garlic , aroma tomato , a fresh lime , a red onion and some fresh cilantro .when we come back we 're going to prep our avocados .
after you 've prepped your container , the next step is to green the container .so , first we 're going to find a greenery that 's really going to enhance the design .now this is a very small , petite design , so we would n't want to use something like lemon leaf because it 's going to totally overwhelm the design .it 's just way too big .this is much better for a bigger design .so , what i did is i went out and picked some pittosporum which a lot of people have growing in their yard , and it 's totally fine to use in this design .it 's got a nice , cute little umbrella shape and it will fill in nicely .it 's the right proportion to the teacup .so , we can use all these little pieces .so we 're using the pittosporum , and we 're also going to use the seeded eucalyptus as an accent greenery .so , this has kind of a nice , lazy design which will also almost mimic what 's on the plate and on the container .this has a nice little decorative element , the seeded eucalyptus .and that is how you select your greenery .
so today i 'm going to talk to you about compact digital cameras. [CLS] [SEP]also referred to as point and shoots and how you can get amazing pictures with them .today i am going to talk to you about compact digital cameras and why you might consider choosing a smaller point and shoot as compared to some of the larger dslr 's .so the camera that i personally own is a canon , i have sort of an affinity towards canons although there are a lot of great manufacturers out there. [CLS] [SEP]so you can definitely shop around and choose the brand that fits you best .so this particular model is the power shot .it is a 7 . [CLS] [SEP]1 megapixel camera and they 're great because they 're so small .i mean this is about the size of a deck of cards. [CLS] [SEP]so you could easily throw it in your bag , you can bring it everywhere and one of my number one tips that i always tell people is have your camera with you .that 's how you take great pictures .so this is an easy camera to always have with you and you can just pull it out. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's very intuitive , simple and easy to use .today compact digital cameras actually have amazing features and controls. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to go over many of those later on .there 's also manual operations that are available on these like you can set your film speed , your aperture , you can control the lighting with them , it 's pretty amazing .so then there 's also a zoom lens built into these cameras , which sometimes you have to be a little bit careful because if you 've got it in your pocket , that might be a problem .i 'm going to go over protecting your camera later. [CLS] [SEP]but these cameras also offer video which is a nice trick especially with our internet savvy users today .it 's very simple to video or update your blog .
let 's take a look at the guitar .so far , this is where we 're at .okay ?from this position , we 're just going to slide our pinkie up to the 3rd fret of the b string ,okay ?we 're going to put our middle finger back to the 2nd fret .we 're going to hit them all together to start .hit the bass note , then high , then bass , then take your middle finger off and hit them all together again .hit the bass , and then we 're going to take our index finger and put it on this 1st fret of the g string .this third bar sounds like this .and then we move into the fourth bar .we 're going to slide our fingers , our ring and pinkie , back to the 2nd fret of the g and the b string .then we 're going to hit the open a string now with our thumb and hit the g and b strings with our fingers here .it sounds like this .bass , high , bass , together , bass , together .okay ?the third bar , again , sounds like this .and then into the fourth bar .all together , all four bars sound like this .then it starts again .all right , we 're about to start our top 5 countdown .join me in our next segment , we 'll take a look at number 5.see you there .
they 're in our pockets ; they 're in our purses .they 're everywhere in our life .we use them all the time .they 're ringing , they 're buzzing , they 're going off at all times .kiss of death in an interview is that if you don ’ t care enough to turn your phone , i probably do n't care enough to hire you .my thinking is and has always been and. [CLS] [SEP]the people that i have discussed this with have always said the same thing .if you 're going in for an interview , make that interviewer the most important person at that time .the best way to do that is to leave your cell phone in your car that 's in the parking lot , because there is nothing as important as that interview when you 're there .nothing .you can always get voicemail .that 's why they have them .turn your phone off , leave it in your car .when you go in , be focused and ready to go for the interview .
ok ?`` hello there , good sir !i 'm thirsty and need to be quenched . [CLS] [SEP]''`` well , i would like nothing more than to pour you a drink . [CLS] [SEP]''`` wonderful !wonderful !what do you suggest ? ''`` well , for just one nickel , i can give you this here soda .but for two shiny nickels i can scoop in a plop of ice cream . [CLS] [SEP]''`` well , then here 's a dime ! ''`` one dime !one dime !he gave me one dime ! ''and that 's how you play opera .
let 's say that you went out and you had your run .you come back , and your back 's really tight --your back 's hurting .you have your hamstrings and your hips that you 're flexing every day , have someone take a look at your form because you want to make sure that you have a strong posterior chain .now , your posterior chain is your hamstrings , your glutes , and your spinal rectors are the ones that run up and down your upper back .and the way that ... [CLS] [SEP]the ways that you can work those muscles , you can work them easily with bird dogs , bridges , and then crunches will help with your lower back as well .you also might want to have a professional or a ...someone who know ... [CLS] [SEP]who you know who 's a good runner to watch your form .you may be doing some other things that are ... [CLS] [SEP]improperly during your run that you might not be able aware of , but a professional or , you know , a ...an experienced runner will be able to point out .could be that your feet are overpronating , you could be supernating .it could be in your knees .it could be even be , you know , anywhere .i 'm ken kashabura , and that 's how to treat lower back pain from running .
again , i 'm going to be using bubble wrap for these because these are extra delicate and extra special .you just get a roll , whatever size you need for whatever it is that you 're wrapping .this actually is double layer , so i can go ahead and put my little figurine in there .then i 'm going to go ahead and just take my scissors and cut a piece .i 'm actually going to make mine a little bigger right there .just cut it .then you just go ahead and roll it up .that 's going to be nice and secure .then just go with the next one .i 'm going to do the baby jesus next .this baby jesus is well loved in my family .my kids like to keep it next to their night tables during christmas .it 's a lot of fun .again , just take your piece , measure how much bubble wrap you want , cut it , and it really could n't be easier .if you have any leftover , obviously the kids love to go ahead and play popping these .i recommend always having a little bit of bubble wrap lying around .i 'm going to finish wrapping these in a minute .my going to take these guys out of here .then this is going to go right back into the original box that it came in .this is really the best way to pack this away .it has some styrofoam in there .it 's going to be well protected , and because it is so neatly packed and so tightly packed in there , it 's actually a great place for me to go ahead and put my figurines in there .then everything 's going to be in one spot .i 'm going to go ahead and finish this up. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'll see you at the next clip with another tip .
some people do n't have the strength to use kettlebells , or anything else for that matter , but you can start them out with the rope .and some of the things you can do is , for instance , you grab it underhanded , pull out , squat , press .it 's going to be a slight bit forward so squat , press , squat , press , squat , press , alternate arms .and what that does is they are leaning back against the ropes. [CLS] [SEP]so they feel safe but at the same time , they 're getting. [CLS] [SEP]that total body movement along with -- trust me -- cardio , okay ?
so we 're going to put the first two phrase of the guitar solo from `` i 'm satisfied with you '' , together .( playing )i 'm going to play it really slowly now .( playing )
our potatoes are just about done .so , we 're going to take our oregano ; we 're not really even going to remove it from the stem because these stems are all very , very soft .so i 'm going to go over to the middle of my knife to initially cut the oregano .i 'm going to turn it and bunch it all back up together and do it again .i 'm going to turn it one more time. [CLS] [SEP]and now what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to put my hand here to hold it. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to use the back part of this knife because most people use the front part .so , this is the sharpest part .so , if you 're going to cut fresh herbs ; parsley or cilantro or oregano or rosemary or something like that , you want to keep using the back of your knife .that will be much faster .if you 're holding the knife down like this ; not only are you not using the front , but you 're not making that loud noise and this will go a lot faster and it will be easier to control your oregano from moving around the cutting board .alright , now we 're going to turn our heat off our back burner. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll drain our potatoes and bring them back to our pot. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll sprinkle our oregano over the top .we 'll add a little bit of salt and pepper ; about a teaspoon of each. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 're going to add our oil ; a little less than a quarter cup .and if the potatoes are a little bit too dry , we 'll add just a little bit more oil and once they 're mashed , we 'll bring them back over here to our buttered baking dish .just scoop them out. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 're going to spread them flat over half of our pan. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to put them in the oven. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to bake them until they get a little bit brown. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 'll scoop them out and cut them into squares .
one of my favorite styles right now , is this one that i show you here , a dome skirt .i love the way the silhouette flares out in the middle of the skirt , and then jets back in .for some reason , i think it 's just the cutest thing in the world , but not everybody you 're designing for , is going to be able to pull off this look , because it does add extra volume , hence , extra mass through the body .it 's not skintight , and it 's going to look like you have a caricature of hips , but it 's really cute when done correctly , so this is a dome skirt .we 'll do a natural waist line , and i want this to fall right above the knees , so i make my hemline , and then what makes it a dome skirt , is the fact that it , i was going to say domes out , but it does n't make sense .it goes out .it flares out , and then back in , creating the dome look , so you could have it be huge , or you can have it like his .i prefer just a little bit , so do this , and then in order to show better that it is a dome skirt , i added these seam lines , because they parallel the curvature of the dome , and just makes it more apparent for you , makes the point come across better .
one of the more interesting needles that we use in chinese medicine is what 's known as the seven star needle .the seven star needle is oftentimes used for large areas such as along the spine , for pain or certain muscles that run parallel to the spine , or even on the arms or legs .this needle is actually a handle that the practitioner is able to work with , as well as a series of seven small prongs at the head of the needle .this is actually used in a tapping motion along the body and may feel , at first , actually quite relaxing ,at some point it may feel a little uncomfortable , so be sure that you give feedback to your practitioner .once he 's able to get a little bit of a sensation there with the seven star needle , that 's time for him to move on to another area .unfortunately the best way to equate it is somewhat similar to a meat tenderizer , although not quite as mean .so when we use this needle , you 're going to feel a tapping on your back .and so the practitioner will work this along that area of the spine , and oftentimes after the treatment , you 'll actually have a little bit of a rash and perhaps a little bit of scabbing .so that 's natural and expected and will go away within a few days .so do n't be surprise if it 's a little bit itchy and then give feedback to your practitioner .this is oftentimes use in combination with the normal filiform acupuncture and should be just as relaxing as the rest of your treatment .so enjoy your seven star needle treatment along with everything else .
it 's really nourishing for the skin .it 's like food for the skin with all the , the added nutrients in there .and it 's really going to help tone the complexion and smooth out the texture in addition to firming , which everybody loves .so this is one of our very best , most popular anti-aging treatments .and with the moisturizer , you just want to apply liberally and just spread it all over the main areas of the face. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to always take any moisturizer down to your neck .a lot of people ignore the neck , but actually that shows signs of aging pretty quickly as opposed to the face .so feel free to bring your moisturizers down .and once that 's all rubbed in , you have completed the vitamin c facial treatment .
clancy rose : all right .so now that you know everything that you have to have to assemble the single americano , we 're going to talk about the main ingredient in the single americano which would be the beans that we 're using for the espresso shot .one of the most common misconceptions about espresso roast is that coffee is roasted darker for espresso which is n't necessarily true .you can use any coffee that you want for any espresso shot .what makes an espresso an espresso is the process of making the espresso .it 's the extraction process .it 's the ratio of coffee to water being a lot higher than the ratio of coffee to water in a normal cup of coffee .so for a single americano , you can use whatever coffee you like and just a coffee that you 're comfortable with the flavors , keeping in mind that in espresso extraction any flavors in the coffee are going to be a whole lot more intense than a regular cup of coffee .
schmuel : okay .so now we 're ready to put this all together .and since this recipe will feed , basically , 8 to 12 people , we 're going to use -- this is a 9 x 13 casserole pan .and we need to grease it , so we 're just using some of our spray canola oil .you can use any type of spray .you can oil it by hand .it does n't really matter .it should just be greased , so that you 'll be able to clean it up easier .and just pour in your mac and cheese mixture .and those lumps , that 's our cottage cheese .and that 's really going to be nice once it gets heated .it 's not going to taste lumpy .it 's just going to taste really kind of delicious .and this kind of -- it 's self-leveling like a good self-leveling concrete .umm , wow , that 's some good stuff , okay .then on top of that , we have our crumb mixture .we 're going to sprinkle that as evenly as possible over this .and i do n't know if i told you about preheating your oven to 350 degrees 'cause. [CLS] [SEP]that 's where we 're going to bake this at for a half hour till everything gets golden brown and the cheese gets thick and creamy and the topping is crisp and crunchy and brown and delicious .so there we go .this is ready to go in the oven , an incredible macaroni and cheese kosher style .i 'm going to put it in the oven .so keep clicking and you 'll see what it looks like when i take it out , okay ?keep clicking .
hi , i 'm les whitley .here today to talk about stretching the muscles of the shoulders .the muscles can divided into multiple different components .ideally the muscles of the upper part of the shoulder as well as the muscles of the upper back .you begin by stretching these as any ; you always want to think about warming up the muscle first .ideally with some nice full range of shoulder rotations forward , backward .nice easy arm hugs crossing your arms alternating one on top of the other to improve blood flow and to warming up the muscle efficiently .the by improving the flexibility start with a straight arm across the body stretch grabbing above the elbow pulling across the body until you feel a tightness in the upper part of the back and rear of the shoulder .holding these stretches anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds to improve flexibility .on both sides of course for good balance then progressing to the front part of the shoulder , ideally with elbow bent slightly lower than shoulder level .use a stable object such as a post or a door frame ; begin by turning your body away from that stable object until you feel a slight little pull in the front .this will also help stretch out the muscles of the chest as well .key point to keep the elbow below shoulder level to minimize the impact and the stress on the joint , holding again for 15 up to 30 seconds for flexibility improvement .repeating on both sides of the body and incorporating daily into a good part of your routine to help improve shoulder flexibility .warming up the muscles that you 're going to be stretching is a key-portent part before you begin any flexibility routine to allow that muscle to appropriately move through all ranges of motions .
have you heard this phrase ?come seven , come eleven ?baby needs a new pair of shoes ?and then someone throws a pair of dice .well , that is craps .now , craps is a casino stall work , right ?and , much money exchanges hands in the game of craps .usually , and always every time it 's from the player to the casino , because there 's no way to beat craps long term , but we can have a lot of fun playing the game. [CLS] [SEP]and we do n't have to bet .if we play it at home , and we do n't include betting , we do n't even need a craps layout , because this is , it is a simplified game .it 's a fun game. [CLS] [SEP], you 'll always use two six sided dice and , you can have a good time at it , and i say it 's okay to teach your kids , because really , all you 're doing is rolling two dice and trying to hit a number and score points .look at that , lucky seven for me .
this is going to be part two of how to throw your ball .there ?s a couple more tips that i needed to tell you about .a couple of things is , you want to keep your shoulders square .so if you 've watched me in the clip before , i kind of dip up my right shoulder a little bit , make sure that my right shoulder is square with my left one .when you come through with the ball , you want to make sure your shoulders are square towards your marks .another good tip is with your arms , after your right arm comes down past your knee , you want to keep your left arm straight out in front of you , as you follow through bring your left arm back , behind you and follow through .this way it keeps you balanced and square towards your mark .
the next plug in is chorus .now chorus is going to add multiple signals together to create kind of a spacey type sound as well .what we can do is we can go into our modulation inserts and select chorus , stereo .now what we can do is look through the different presets and press play just to check out what they 've got already on here .so i 'm going to look in here , glimmering chorus .now we 're going to cycle through each of them .when looking at or working with any of these choruses remember that you can always change the mix to get that desired sound that you 're looking for .the mix is basically going to allow you to turn up the wet signal and the dry signal .now the , the , the wet signal is going to be the chorus effected signal and. [CLS] [SEP]this way you can turn down and you kind of blend the two signals together to achieve what you want .
but , i think we should shape it some more .now you can use finger tips to shape our bowl , and again you got to get it wet , or we can use our tools .i want to show you this tool , a cd a regular old cd. [CLS] [SEP], it 's nice and perfectly round .i like to use this because it has a hole in it. [CLS] [SEP]and i can stick my finger in there and hold it .how i 'm going to do this is i 'm going to start in the center of my pot and come down here like this .i 'm going to slowly press it off to the side ,got to get it wet a little bit .you can see how the cd is just perfectly round , how well that works .i 'm going to press till the whole cd is pressing down there where i want it to press actually .slowly bring the tool up , up to the top. [CLS] [SEP]and i. [CLS] [SEP]'m pressing out a little bit , till the whole thing hits .slowly back away , i 'm not going to keep coming up like this. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to back away , this way .clean my tool off .take a look at it .ca n't see very well ,so i 'm going to take the water , take the water out of it again .look how much that has changed .here 's what i 'm going to do , here 's a little step for you to clean that lip off again , just take your sponge gently go around your piece like that , take some of that little clay off there. [CLS] [SEP]and while you 're at it just clean that wheel off again .so now that bowl is just perfectly round , the bottom is like that .
this next clip is going to be a one armed row with a rotation .okay , you 're going to take your stability band .you 're going to attach it onto a base .remember to make sure it 's nice and secure .now what you 're going to do is you 're going to grab your band .make sure you have enough distance behind you and you 're going to do a one armed row with a rotation .you 're going to feel some additional torque in your obliques as you turn .so you 're going to start off with overhand grip .okay , when you turn the palm is going to go down .you 're going to pivot your body .okay , you 're starting off in almost a lunge-type stance , knees slightly bent , and you 're going to rotate that right foot out .okay .your shoulders should stay level with your elbow .overhand grip , we 're going to rotate out .okay .you 're twisting almost like into a semi-lunge position , keeping that shoulder and elbow in alignment , palm flat .so you 're almost getting two exercises in one .
let 's step it up outside with step ups .first , you need an elevated location .make sure that your knee is either even with or below your hip .you are going to step your feet together to match that level and then step back down .basic .you are going to work that lower body .and that constant movement is going to get your heart rate up as well .so you can do this. [CLS] [SEP], just make sure it is a safe , clear area and you can step up and down .i want you to use the arms , squeeze the glutes , and then come down and switch to the other side .place that other foot up and back down .and up .squeeze .and that is your step up .
they do not use the directions .the compass .but what they using is the ba gua .that is you see it very often .the ba gua it 's using the exactly the same feng shui principle as the classic. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's easy for you to apply because it does n't have to worry about the directions .mainly it 's the entrance way .and the then from where you enter you would know what part of the house related to what part of your life .
so , when we 're doing painting , what we 're really doing is we 're creating these perceptual contrasts .use of red , use of green , is , creates brightness , that we would n't ordinarily be aware of .by using green , selectively , around these red objects , even though it may not be exactly the pattern that 's on there , although that was the intent when the designer of that piece of fabric was doing it .they were using the same technique of off-setting the reds with the greens , in order to make them , each of those colors , more brilliant .so , we have the ability as the artist to control what the brain sees .and so , i use those awarenesses that color does that , and the way that complimentary colors set each other off and make them more brilliant .purposefully , to make the paintings much more interesting .again , i 'm going to continue to refer to my original source material , and take liberties , wherever i want to .what this ends of looking like , ultimately , is a combination of what we see , and what i develop as i 'm working , using these devices of complimentary colors , in order to make it more interesting and to give it more dynamic range , and visual interest and texture .
now we are going to just arrange our mushrooms. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll hold them and slice them. [CLS] [SEP]and then once they are cut , i am going to measure out another tablespoon of butter , come back to my pan and turn this up to about 7. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll let that melt .while we are waiting for it to melt , i am going to take just a little bit of onion and just cut off the top. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll just cut one ring and cut that in half. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 'll peel our outer layer of skin , discard the tops , and then just going to mince this very very finely for both pieces .
and i 'm going to show you the things that we do before we take an alpaca to the show , to an alpaca show .the first thing we have to do is make sure that they 're halter trained .make sure that they 're comfortable going in and out of a halter , making sure that having this thing around their muzzle does n't spook them out at all .make sure that the halter fits that the halter sits high enough up on the nose. [CLS] [SEP]so it does n't block any of their breathing passages .and halter training can actually take anywhere from a month , to a few months , and. [CLS] [SEP]once they 've turned the corner and they learn what it means to be halter trained , they are halter trained .it 's very , very interesting .it happens over night , where you could be working with them for quite a while. [CLS] [SEP]and they do n't seem to get it. [CLS] [SEP]and then all of a sudden , they 've got it , and you know it , and they know it .so , here we have an alpaca on a lead , and ready to be taught how to halter train .what we do initially with halter training is we train them. [CLS] [SEP], it 's an alpaca , we train them with their moms , and that 's a wonderful device , is to take the alpaca , the cria , with their moms out onto the road or out onto the pasture and where the mom goes , the cria will also go .and that 's how we initially start them walking with a halter and lead. [CLS] [SEP]and we never force them .we never are harsh with them .we just tell them where we want them to go .and it does n't take much at all. [CLS] [SEP], it 's just telling them where we want them to go .
now , we 're going to show the drawing of the foot taper .so , we 're going to use some ice picks and our stick to draw a nice , smooth curve to get our foot taper .we 're going to be using a long , straight stick and this particular stick. [CLS] [SEP]is about three sixteenths of an inch thick and it 's one inch wide .to bend the stick for accurate broad seams , you 'll need three ice picks .this is either end of our seam. [CLS] [SEP]and this is a straight line .we want to add about a half inch of round .this is the seam , flat on the floor .i 'll make a mark here about a half inch out .i have another pick installed over here to keep the entry to our curve very , very straight and the stick will allow more curve at the end .so , you can see what a precise curve we 're able to draw .
now we 've drawn our angry expression , let 's move on to something more happy .literally so , happy expression time .keep in mind our neutral expression , and what we 're going to do is you 're going to see the eye shape is largely going to be the same on this one .and , we 're going to draw our eyes the same way .we 're not going to draw eyelids because this is going to be an excited , happy expression .so we 're going to leave those off .we 're going to draw a nose the same as we would otherwise .we 're going to draw the eyebrows up here tilting upwards , slightly .very subtly off balanced , because this is going to be an excited , happy expression on your face .we 're going to draw , of course , here the u-shape everyone knows .usually , i like to add something else .a bit of a smile .which is , basically , i draw a nearly vertical line and then skew it back in .and on this one , actually , i do n't mind using some vertical lines to note some teeth .draw in our ears over here .we bunch up the cheeks .especially one over , actually on this side , where we do n't have the mouth .because you have kind of a bit of a crooked grin going on , so this side of the head will be bunched up some .not in anger this time , in happiness .draw the jaw line , come back and around .this side is slack .draw in hair in here .now other things you can do to also denote happiness are you can have lines coming out of the top .i 'll draw these in here because people are really happy .i mean this guy ,wow !he just looks like he just won a million bucks !maybe he did !you want to go for ultra effects , you can even draw in some extra shapes , like stars here at the top , but that 's optional .this guy looks pretty happy enough .
blood money is a registered trademark of io interactive , a company with which i have no affiliation .so we just drop down , tap x to hide the fiber wire .and now , we 've got a power box here .we can press the a button to disable the power box and turn out the lights on the drug lab. [CLS] [SEP]so we 'll do that .now , we 've got the cover of darkness here. [CLS] [SEP]so we can sneak around so. [CLS] [SEP]the objective says `` sneak through the factory '' and the different people here in the drug lab are wondering what 's going on , and they 're running around , but they do n't know i 'm here and as long as i sneak. [CLS] [SEP]and i do n't run too fast. [CLS] [SEP], they wo n't know. [CLS] [SEP]so i can just sneak by them .hitman is a stealth game. [CLS] [SEP]so you , ideally , would want to sneak into the mission and take out only your target , or only the people that you have to take out in order to get to your target and leave the innocent people alone .that 's what 's. [CLS] [SEP]a good skilled professional hitman would do .it 's not always possible and sometimes , things go bad. [CLS] [SEP]so you might need to take out other people and the fun of this game. [CLS] [SEP]is that you can really play it anyway you want .so if you do want to go into a level and kill everybody. [CLS] [SEP], that 's okay , as long as you can survive the fire fight .or if you want to try to be really stealthy and use disguises and trick people , then , that 's a perfectly valid way of going about the game as well .
so where to collect ruby stained glass collecting you can start in your local antique shops which you have in your own area you can also look at local shows that are periodical spring , summer and fall unusually have local shows .we have rimfield here in new england which is a very big show that you can find pretty much anything you want to collect .so collecting the shows are really a great place to start , start collecting at shops and also going to auctions there a great place to collect .you can also go to ebay or the internet which you can find this ruby flash glass. [CLS] [SEP]there also , there are a number of resources that you can go to collect this type of glass .so that 's a start. [CLS] [SEP]i would start locally first being able to talk to someone who understands what there selling can give you a little history .they can let you handle the things and that gives you a hands on start. [CLS] [SEP]so i would recommend starting in your local shops if that 's possible .
basic outdoor agility drill .interval training , jump rope .the oldest exercise in the book .what you want to do is focus on keeping your core engaged and only going at your own fitness level .again , if you 're not mohammad ali , i 'm not expecting you to go back and forth .if you 're just a basic person just getting back into the swing of things , you keep your body in motion .always in motion .chest upright , always in motion .now with that same jump rope , you could go , bring it down onto the floor , make a line with it , and you could go into , over , over , over , over , just to have a guide of what you want to do laterally .over , over , over .bring that jump rope back up and go right back into that jump rope again .because what the thing is , what you want to focus on , is constantly keeping your body moving .so that you can stay warm and that you get the best exercise possible .
next we 're going to plug the wiring from the trailer into the truck .what this is going to do is give us brake lights , tail lights , turn signals on our trailer just like in our vehicle so people behind you still know if you 're stopping , if you 're turning .it 's just a safety precaution .and as far as i know you have to have lights on your trailer in every state .this is the type of plug we 're going to use .this is a plug that 's set up for not only lights but also trailer brakes .and this is where we have have the plug in mounted to the vehicle .and just on the top of this there 's a raised slot and in here that 's on top .you 're going to slide that in .and the cap on this actually holds this in from popping out .it hooks on to that raised slot on top .there are a few different kinds for just basic lights .you can have a flat plug like this one .nice thing about this connection. [CLS] [SEP], if you maybe have a different trailer , most of your utility trailers will just have a flat plug , you can still use the same connection there .if you have a trailer brake on something larger , a trailer like this that 's a car trailer , equipment trailer , that 's going to be wired to this connection , and you 're going to have a box in the front of your truck that you can set the control on the electric brake on the trailer as to how much pressure you want that brake hitting when you hit the brake .you can adjust it if you want more or less .which will definitely help you stop a lot better instead of having all the weight on the trailer pushing your vehicle forward , it 's actually stopping with your vehicle .
so , as i continue to establish a relationship with this dog , i 'm encouraging her with pretty much doggy caviar , she 's getting some hot dogs offered to her , and a few natural treats , and she likes those , pretty well enough .and , we already know she can jump up on top of things , so we 're going to see if we can get her on this box .come here , good girl , good , up , come here , good , come on up , good , good. [CLS] [SEP], come on up , good , come on .good girl !good , good , good , good .so in the space of fifteen minutes , she 's gone to not having a leash on , wanting to fight the leash , to actually accepting the direction i 'm giving with the leash , to help her get on top of this box .so , let 's see if we can get her all the way up .come on up , come on up , come on up , come on , good .good , good !good girl !good !good , good girl !come on , good , good , back it up , good .now , i 'm going to help her find where her feet are right now , good .now , she 's sitting on top of the box .good .
and you know what ?you can take your life into your own hands sometimes when you go into there to cheer for the opposing team .i 'm going to give you a little background story ,i 'm getting a little nostalgic here .there 's a time where i went with my father-in-law to a yankees game .they were playing the minnesota twins .we were in yankee stadium .and the twins are starting to kick some booty. [CLS] [SEP]and i stand up and tell all yankee fans that they ca n't spell the last name of doug mankovich .and they could n't .i know new yorkers , they could n't spell the last name .and i swear to god. [CLS] [SEP]i thought i would n't get out alive .i did and now i kind of avoid those stadiums just because i have a big mouth .but you do n't always need to do that .now , especially if you 're at home , it 's important to remember that you 're probably going to come home a little sore if you 're truly there to root for your team .you 're going to be doing the wave , you 're going to be stomping your feet , you 're going to be running around , you 're going to be screaming .i leave games hoarse .it 's very important that you 're going to go there , get your money 's worth .do n't sit there and just be ...people are all there for the same reason .they have a passion for that sport .they 're there to cheer .they 're there to cheer on whoever it is they want to cheer on .and so , get into it .that does n't mean to be a jerk to your neighbor .it does n't mean to spill their beer over .it just means , get into it .learn the wave .learn the seventh inning stretch .take me out to the ballgame , you 've got to know that song .you 've got to be able to get up and sing it and just blast it out .know the star-spangled banner , that 's really important at the beginning of the game .that 's a great moment .i will tell you as a former player it was very important to me .that was the one song that would actually almost make me tear up every time i was on the field and heard it .it 's just that moment that you 're giving a tribute to everything else , you 're saying thank you to everybody for letting me play a game for a living .and also , you know what ?you get to be a fan for three hours. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's almost like a tip of the cap to that .so learn those songs .take some time to learn them .they can all be a little silly but the fact is that you get there , it 's not silly .it 's about being passionate about your team , about really supporting them. [CLS] [SEP]and they need it .and after 162 games , those guys get tired .so hearing your fans roaring for you , it keeps you going .because working nine months out of the year when you 're on the road for four and a half to five months of it , those players deserve it just like you deserve them to perform well .take me out to the ballgame .take me out to the crowd .buy me some peanuts and crackerjacks .i do n't care if i ever get back for its root , root , root for the home team .and if they do n't win it 's a shame .for its one , two , three strikes you 're out at the old ball game .american idol , i am not .
a frequently asked question by many patients are whether or not the herbs that we 're prescribing to them are safe and free from things like lead and arsenic , that we hear so often that are coming out of china in certain products .and that is a very , very good question to make sure that you ask your practitioner .there are some brands that are very safe , that they 're doing appropriate testing for heavy metals , such as lead and arsenic .they 're checking for things like bacteria , and they 're checking to make sure that the proper plant has been used in that herbal formula .so , ask your patient-your practitioner these types of questions before you willingly accept that the herbs that they prescribe to you .something else that 's oftentimes brought up in relationship to chinese herbs , and that 's whether or not they have been adulterated with pharmaceuticals or other kinds of over-the-counter chemicals , such as tylenol , or even prescription medications .and that 's something that very few brands have .it has been a problem in the past , but now , with the more reputable companies that have factories that are approved by the fda and have been inspected , they meet good manufacturing programs from the gmp .so , make sure that your practitioner gives you the good quality herbs that are safe .and , unfortunately , when you want to get the good quality herbs , they oftentimes cost a few dollars more .so , take that time to make sure you get the most effective herbs , and the safest herbs , that are available on the market .and ask good questions of your practitioner to ensure that they 're following good manufacturing practices .
you want to first break you opponents balance coming to the front .once his legs is in front again easy and bring back you need to pull back with both hands as we are doing the sweep .jonathan is going to show us .notice he sweeps him before the leg is down on the ground in firm. [CLS] [SEP]you want to get that foot while it is stepping forward .show you in real time .
now we 're going to learn the drop down with your first hand .come up into lasso with your first hand .look up at the hoop .notice when the hoop opens up in front of your body .take your second hand and start to reach up through that opening in the hoop .the next time your second hand reaches up into the hoop , we 're going to turn and drop the hoop down to our waist .second hand reaches up , turn , and release at the waist .let 's go over that a little bit more .starting up here in lasso with your first hand .second hand reaches up and guides the hoop down .your right hand comes across the chest and releases right here at the waist .then do n't forget to start hooping around your waist .come up in to lasso with your first hand , second reaches through circling , and release at the waist .one more time .take the hoop up into lasso .second hand reaches through the hoop , hoop drops across the chest and releases at the waist .once you start to feel this , you do n't have to use your second hand as a guide .you can just start to release the hoop down and turn .turning is really helpful as you 're learning this move .it slows down the hoop a little bit and just makes it quite a bit easier .i 'll show you one more time .alright .nice job .
in this clip , we 're going to be doing a forward lunge with the coaster and a cuff .okay .you are already going to have your exercuffs on .place your coaster on the floor .place the balls of your right foot on the coaster .and we are going to lunge forward nice and slow .okay .i like to extend my arms forward .if that 's not comfortable for you , you can put your hands on your hips .create some additional stability .keeping your back nice and straight .remember this is slow and controlled .extending forward .the knee should n't go forward of the toe .back should be nice and straight .shoulders back and relaxed .okay .slide forward .your should be feeling this in your quadriceps , your hams , your gluts and your calve muscles .going to slide forward to our lunge position .watch those knees make sure they do n't go forward the toes .going to slide forward nice and slow .maintain your lunge position .and slowly bring your feet back together to the starting position .these are kind of challenging. [CLS] [SEP]so i would probably start off with doing ten on either leg .so start with doing ten on either leg and do two to three sets .
the same applies but you 're going to get different sounds with the rods .here 's the american starting with the up stroke .here 's the german with the rods .the same story applies .you can get the most volume with the german down stroke .but you may find yourself playing all three .
now we need to know what kind of clothes do we need to put in it .are we going on a trip to the sunny south ?do we need our shades , and our swimsuits , and our suntan lotion ?or , are we going to a wintry wonderland where we need to be warm and cozy ?all things that you need to take into consideration when you 're putting together your wardrobe .it 's always best to have a layered kind of look where ever you 're going be it to a warm climate or in chilly temps .always go so that you can be warmer , put on , or take off .we 'll be back in a second and we 'll see exactly what kind of things we 'll make work for us in both those fields .
alright , first let 's talk about analyzing characteristics .and the first thing that i recommend that you take a look at is culture .now when i 'm talking about culture , i 'm talking about where is your audience from .and you probably have lots of different cultures making up your audience .you might have people , and when i talk about culture , i 'm talking about culture within the united states like texas vs new york , california vs florida .all of us that live in different states , we have slightly different cultures .but i 'm also talking about different places around the world .you might have americans , you might have britons , you might have australians , you might have indonesians , you might have chinese , japanese .whatever it is , first take a look at the cultural makeup of the audience .then based on that cultural makeup , you want to take into consideration , things that could be offensive to people of that culture as you pick your topic , and as you write your speech .so you might have to do a little further research once you find out the cultures of where your audience is from .
now we are ready to put on the final patina which will give it that antiquie flavor .right ?so here we have our patina it comes also in copper. [CLS] [SEP]this is black which i like because it gives it the ancient look. [CLS] [SEP]and we just put it on it .instantly we have this , the old metallurgy look .no one would guess that it 's a modern piece .see how quickly it goes on , very fast , and it protects the solder form oxidizing on the copper foil. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's important for that otherwise the stuff gets this flaky look .so now we have given it that instant patina black look , the antiquing. [CLS] [SEP], how nice that is to get the light coming through .i 'm not sure .and we will then turn it over for the protective beautifying patina .and then we 'll give it a rinse with the wash with the water again and it is complete .now over to the sink for the rinsing .a little hot water and the brush action .probably not that .there we go , oop wrong side ,oh that 's perfect .so in just a few easy steps we have made our own stain glass window .
now that you know how to juggle , what you need to do is just practice it enough so that you actually can .learning from a video is a little hard , but you need to go home and practice it on your own .and everything should work out if you do it long enough .so you know how to juggle , what you need to do now is find something worth juggling .there are a couple different things that people usually juggle .what i 'm using right now are called loose filled bean bags .and they 're just , they 're just like a hacky sack or something , just a very loose bean bag .a lot of jugglers use these for higher number juggling .if you 're juggling five or more .i like them a lot. [CLS] [SEP], they 're easy , they 're soft .i think they 're pretty .a lot of jugglers like to use perfect spheres however , instead of the loose bean bags .what i have here are a couple of different kinds of balls that normal jugglers use .this would be a tight filled bean bag , you can get these or the loose filled bean bag online .and there 's a lot of different juggling vendors around .these feel pretty similar , they do n't roll when you drop them which is always a good thing .and they 're pretty easy to learn how to juggle .this is what a normal juggling ball would be .there 's also what are called stage balls similar to this .a stage ball will be a sphere , it 's usually made out of hard rubber .this one 's rubber foam , but they usually do roll a little bit if you drop .they 're usually much bigger , kind of as a visual effect for people who are juggling on stage maybe .and professional jugglers who do three ball routines or circus jugglers often use stage balls .there 's also one of my favorite types of ball , it 's called a russian ball .now this is a homemade russian ball , but you can find them online as well .and what a russian ball is , it 's a plastic sphere with a grain in it of some sort .like this one has birdseed in it .what happens is it will juggle just like a normal sphere , but it 's lighter than a solid filled and when you drop it , it wo n't roll because of the grains inside of it .so this is one of my favorite things to juggle with .and you can get them online with different vendors , or you can make your own like this .
so there are a couple of things you can do to make it a simple process .the most obvious thing is to make a list of everything you have .not only should you use a written check list but you should also make a count of everything you have and every time you move equipment , just do a count ;1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 make sure you have everything .much like people do wi3th luggage .keep all of your items labeled .you can do it with a sharpie , you can do it with stickers .stickers are actually a great way because if you are in a dark club , people may not be able to read the little notes that you have on your amp. [CLS] [SEP]but if you have a giant sticker , you will know whose amp it is and whose guitar case it is .when you are traveling with your equipment , try to keep all of that in the same place as much as possible .once you get into a club , find one corner that is going to be your corner and put all of your stuff over there .when you finish a show , take all of your equipment off of the stage and put it in a corner back where you had it before .try to keep everything together .any kind of cables should go right back in the bag where you are transporting them and label all of your cables because cables are really what you will loose .you leave a cable lying someone else will decide it is theres , it will belong to another band or it will belong to the club very quickly .keeping track of all of your equipment when traveling can be a pain. [CLS] [SEP]but it is worth taking the extra 20 seconds to do a count or to check the labels to make sure you have everything that belongs to you .because that little amount of time is really worth a great amount of money and time you put in having your equipment. [CLS] [SEP]
now we have our azalea here .we fixed it all up. [CLS] [SEP]and now it 's nice with 5 points , but. [CLS] [SEP]it 's kind of missing the center stem .we 're going to go ahead and create that with another piece of paper .if you look down here , you can see i have a smaller 2x1 .it 's half the size of the original piece of paper we used to make our azalea with .what we 're going to do is we 're going to do the same folds that we did starting off with the main flower .fold it over like so , bisecting it like this .we 're going to go ahead and fold it over this way and bisecting it again like so .open it up .now we have our crease right here in the center , so we 're going to take our top edge here and pull it down to our center , making sure our corner comes up correctly .crease it down really good .other side over .crease it down really well .open it up .go ahead and fold it in half like this .
bow forward , stretch your arms back behind you .then bend your knees and reach back and hold the tops of your feet , hug in with your arm muscles and. [CLS] [SEP]your leg muscles. [CLS] [SEP]so you firm to the core of the body , then lift the heads of the arm bones up toward the sky and draw the shoulder blades into the heart .take the top of the throat back and start to curl your head back to lift your heart up off the floor .at the same time go to the base of the spine and scoop the tail bone down .as you scoop the tail bone extend back through your legs and lift your heart up away from the floor even more .take a few more full breaths here and then release all the way down .we will do it one more time .this time you can try holding your ankles and that gives you a little more support and helps you hug in a little more .hug the legs in , hug the arms in .you can even bend the elbows a little bit and use that action in the arms to lift the heads of the arm bones up toward the sky more .then curl the shoulder blades into the heart and lift your heart up away from the floor .you can press back through your legs to unfold and then release all the way to the earth .you can even turn one cheek and rest it on the floor .
what you 're going to do is instead of having the back legs. [CLS] [SEP]straight , you 're going to actually bend the knee and squat low to the ground .you want to make sure that you 're not too wide , because then you 're open for groin strikes , so you turn the knee in and sit kind of low .do n't stick the butt out. [CLS] [SEP], you want to have a straight back .see , small bow .see it on the other side .start from a long stance , small bow .and this is a very mobile stance .you can start from one side and move very quickly to the other side .see the same thing .with these stances you 're able to cover long distances very , very quickly , and be able to strike , attack and block in succession , rapidly .so again , so you can see it , start from the hands on the waist , step forward into a long bow stance , just bring the back knee in .same thing on the other side , long bow stance , back knee in. [CLS] [SEP], you squat low keeping the back straight , the head up .that 's how you perform the small bow stance in the praying mantis style .
just a simple stitching nothing/no fancy embroidery stitches here .we would come down to the middle and we are making it a little upside down triangle for the nose .we would fill that nose in with satin stitches and satin stitches is just a fancy name for straight stitches going back and forth .you want to fill in the whole nose .just keep stitching back and forth .they also have little like clip on eyes .you can also buy clip on noses .so they come in all different sizes and colors .so if you are not so interested in doing embroidery there is a lot of other options .so you come and after you do the triangle you come start another line. [CLS] [SEP]and you do a little curve on either side .always being sure not to catch the other side of the bear when you are sewing .let me make that mouth curve up there .i 'm going to move on to match that on the other side as closely as possible you want to make the same on both sides of the mouth .we would take a little bit of red and just make a tongue right here .we would knot these making a few loops and bringing it down on the loop , two loops and snip that off .now we would get a little bit of red thread to finish it off .just come off through the back and do a few stitches just a tiny bit of color there .just a tiny tongue sticking out .okay is n't that cute .
okay , there 's two other buttons on the top here .one of them is the auto focus/manual focus , so you can adjust the focus manually if you want to do a manual focus but most of the time the automatic focus is correct .you 've also got an automatic focus with a picture of a sort of an icon of a flower and that 's so that you can do macro with the setup on the automatic focus there .this is the different modes , so you 've got programmable , which is probably what most people will use .you 've also got aperture priority which means that you set an aperture for the lens , and you 're able to , and the cameras computer and electronics sets it up so that the shutter speed will be adjustable and. [CLS] [SEP]then the shutter priority , which means that the aperture will be adjustable by the electronics .
in this segment we 'll talk about rolling the joints .we begin with rolling the neck , now when you do this it 's not about trying to use your muscles , trying to do a big movement .it could be a very , very small movement but what you want to do is to move from the perspective of the spine itself .so you have to really look inwardly. [CLS] [SEP]and you go both directions .and then you do that a number to times. [CLS] [SEP]and then you move into your shoulders .now this idea is not do a big shoulder roll , it 's just really very gentle , very small .and you want to be paying attention to the way your shoulder joint. [CLS] [SEP]actually feels as you go in both directions .then we move our way down into our hips .when you do the hip joint , you have to let your knees be a little bit soft , if you do n't it will lock up your hips .again this is very small , so when you roll your hips you can envision that you are standing in a pool of water .so you 're just rolling your hips or rolling and swimming in that water without any stress or strain at all .now when you go to your ankles what you can do is hold on to a chair and touch with your toe .rolling your heel , drawing a circle with your heel in both directions .and then finally we work our way up to the wrists and we clasp our fingers together , making sure we touch the palms and letting the wrists roll to get a nice natural smooth motion of the wrists .
now , moving through the circle of fifths , we move on to g. [CLS] [SEP]now. [CLS] [SEP]g would ordinarily have , if it were a major 7th chord , a major 3rd which would be b , and a major 7th which would be f sharp .here , these two are lowered to b flat and f , respectively .
i 'm a travel agent .and did you know that traveling on america 's railways is not only a fun and affordable way to travel , but it 's very exciting and educational , too .let 's say you want to go from philadelphia to harrisburg .well , it 's pretty simple .all you need to do is call 1-800-usa-rail , and then you 'll connect with your good friends over at amtrak .or do what i like to do .i like to go to their interactive website .it 's very cool .not only will it show you a map of the route -- in this case , the keystone route map -- but it 'll also give you an interactive area where you could put your itinerary and simply choose your preferences , hit a button. [CLS] [SEP], you get all the information you need in regard to the route , the amenities on the route , and what to prepare for , what to bring , what not to bring , et cetera .keep in mind that all of amtrak 's trains are smoke-free , so always leave your cigarettes at home .once you buy your ticket here online , very simply , take your voucher and your reservation number down , the day of your trip , to the amtrak departure area and you could print out your ticket at an automated kiosk .it 's just that easy .i 'm russ handler , and that 's how you do it .
this is common basil and we have different kinds of basils , but this one like most of the basils , needs a good deal of moisture .i like to break off little sprigs sometimes .and use it in cooking .you can use it around chicken dishes .but , i also just break off little sections sometimes , just for teas .you 're having some iced tea , or hot tea , and you want to add some flavor to it , break off a little section of leaf , and it makes a nice pick-me-up for your tea as well .but you can use it , of course , in many different dishes .it does require a good deal of peat moss and organic material for it to do it 's best .make sure that you water it on a regular basis .this means the size of the container , and this clay pot may be every second or third day .do n't let it get too dry , or it tends to go to seed .it will flower , and then the plant sometimes starts to shut down .often with herbs you 're going to keep picking off that new growth and. [CLS] [SEP]the more you pick , the more the lateral buds will spread , you 'll get a much bushier plant , and you 'll get a plant that will last a lot longer .by doing that of course , you 'll have a good plant for your backyard gardening .for on gardening , i 'm stan defreitas , `` mr. [CLS] [SEP]green thumb '' .
in this clip , we 'll talk about where to get information on ocd .one of the quickest and easiest ways is to hop on the internet in the world wide web .the one thing you want to do is if you type in ocd for example on one of the search engines , you 're going to get pages and pages and pages of information. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's not always the most accurate and correct information .so , some reliable sources you could go to are webmd.com or you could also go to a site that 's dedicated to ocd which is the obsessive compulsion foundation and that website is www.ocfoundation.org .they have a list of everything from what is ocd to support groups , how to find a doctor in your area things that are going to be really useful and helpful to you .if going on the internet is not your thing , you could to talk your primary physician as well .you could go to a local library and look up some information .magazine articles usually medical journals also have some current information .the most important thing is if you think you might have ocd or if your family member or friend who trying to find out more information about ocd , really get the knowledge get the information find out. [CLS] [SEP]whichever way. [CLS] [SEP]you know you can so that you could get your foot in the door .once you have the basics , go to someone who knows what they 're talking about so. [CLS] [SEP]a doctor or a therapist someone who could really help you .
today we 're going to talk about the parts of a skateboard .first and foremost you have the deck .on the deck , you apply the grip tape , the grip tape 's used to help your feet stick to the skate deck when doing tricks .next we have the trucks .the trucks of a skateboard are like , are also called the axles .you have the truck , the base plate , the bushings , which act like a shock or a cushion when it comes to turning , and the axle nut .by adjusting this nut you can loosen it to steer better , or tighten to steer less .next you have your wheels , inside each wheel is two ball bearings .these bearings sit inside the wheel , one on the front side , one on the back side , they mount to the truck like so .next up , you have the riser pads .the riser pad goes between the skate deck and the truck to provide cushion and clearance between your wheels and your board .you need this clearance for your turning radius so your wheels do n't scrape your board .last but not least , you have the mounting hardware .the mounting hardware goes through the deck , through the riser pad , and through the truck , and twist the nut onto the hardware screw , securing the deck , the riser and the truck all together .these are the basic components of a skateboard .
in five card draw poker , every player that is playing would actually put in an ante to put in the original pot .each player is then dealt five cards .they will then look at their five cards and decide if they like the five cards they have or if they would like other cards .initially , once they 've seen their cards , it 'll move to the dealer 's left and that first player will have the chance to actually make a bet .they can either bet , check or basically pass .if they pass , the next person in line will be the one responsible for making the bet .after all the betting round is over , they will then look at their cards and will have an option of discarding some cards and getting cards in return .so let 's say i had a hand. [CLS] [SEP]and i had three tens , a nine and a four .obviously i 'd want to discard the nine and the four .so i would say i want two cards .i would place the two cards on the table .i would get two cards in return hoping to make my three of a kind a better hand .this will go around the table 'til everybody 's done .once they have their their new hand , they can then again , the betting goes in the same the same fashion .you will then decide if you wanted to bet again based on your hand .you can check , you can bet .now if you bet ten and somebody wants to raise you , they can do so. [CLS] [SEP]and then it would be your option as it came back to you to call that raise .that 's the basics of five card poker .hope you get a lot of aces !my name 's dean hale .thanks .
well that has an interesting story .when we first started the business of , we 're not much of a business to begin with .and we started as an ice cream/juice bar place where we introduced sandwiches .and this one company used to bring us our bread with a whole bunch of fuss and difficulties .and to make a long story short his attitude was really bad .so one day i told him , `` you know what ?give me one month. [CLS] [SEP]and i will make my own bread. [CLS] [SEP]and i will not buy bread from you any longer . [CLS] [SEP]''and i went. [CLS] [SEP]and i contacted this gentleman klaus where he was a master baker .i said , `` klaus. [CLS] [SEP]i need some help . [CLS] [SEP]''so within a month he turned us to a bakery and he taught us how to bake .and we brought most of the ingredients from germany because we were fond of the product there .and at that time , 20 years ago , we had ingredients that were somewhat organic .we had to label organic .before organic became organic .we were getting stuff from farms of germany without any pesticides in it .yeah. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's how we started becoming a bakery .
i 'm here to speak to you about how to arrange vacation time after divorce .now , very often , each parent wants to take their child with them to the , a vacation , a summer vacation .and sometimes you have conflicting times when you , vacations may fall at the same time .this is very important to work out ahead of time .if you 're lucky , you 'll do it at the time of the divorce and it becomes part of your divorce papers .what many parents do , is use alternate years .for instance , on odd years , the mother has the child for vacations , and on even years the husband takes the child for vacations .they may do the same thing with christmas and new year 's vacation , thanksgiving .one parent may get the odd years and one parent may get the even numbered years .and , that way , it 's all pre-set and pre-established , and both parents get to share in the child 's welfare .where you have difficulty is when each parent wants the same time , and that 's obviously not going to happen .ah , hopefully both of you will co-operate with this .if you have it pre-set and pre-planned and adhere to that plan , you 'll all have a much happier child in the long run .and , i think that 's what we all look for , mostly for the benefit of the child .i wish you luck in your extended families and in your future endeavors , good luck and god bless .
 , this is a little bit more of a carry over exercise , these are called ice skaters .now , if you have anybody that 's inline skating or is an ice skater , this is much more sport specific .not saying that you can do this with someone that does n't ice skate , but what it focuses on it focuses on the glut medias .the muscle that 's right in the glut and focus on the stability on the opposite ankle .this is great for focusing on stabilization from the ankle all the way to the hips .ice skaters are a great way to make sure that you keep your body and keep things in motion and constantly keep a lower muscular efficient workout as ari is doing right now .also too , to make it a little bit harder you can also even go into the ice skater with touching down here touching to the floor , touching to the floor .excellent job , keeping your chest upright in everything that you do .making sure that you stay as efficient and only go to the speed that you can .these drills are a lot harder than they seem .
what we 're going to do today is we 're going to go through and kind of introduce you to the lathe , tools , chucks , wood , a little bit of everything , grinding , just kind of a quick overview .not really in depth ,but we 're going to try to touch a lot of things to give you a quick overview and have some fun doing it and make it pretty informative to you so you can maybe watch some other clips and know a little bit more about what they 're talking about .that 's what we 're going to do today .
and i 'm here to answer the question. [CLS] [SEP], how do i legally change my name ?well , the process is going to vary from state to state , for the most part , but it has evolved into a very simple process .in fact , this is something that most individuals can do without a lawyer .what i would recommend is that you go to your local court clerk 's office and ask for the form for changing your name and ask for some assistance in filling out the form and proceed accordingly .now there are some things you should know about changing your name .first of all , if you 're going through a bankruptcy proceeding , you probably will not be allowed to change your name until that bankruptcy proceeding has concluded .if you are in the midst of a criminal prosecution , you probably will not be allowed to change your name until the conclusion of that criminal prosecution .but other than that , it 's a very simple process .you pick a name , you decide the name you want to be changed , you complete the paper work , you submit it to a judge for approval. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's pretty much a done deal .i 'm robert todd and thank you for watching .
wiggle the fork to break up the cell of the lemon and get as much juice out of it as possible .give that a little of rotated and you can turn it and fold it the other way. [CLS] [SEP]and you can sometimes get as much as a 1/4 of a cup of juice of one lemon .we need 2 tablespoons for this recipe. [CLS] [SEP]but i 'll juice the whole lemon and after you juice it. [CLS] [SEP]you want to remove the seeds , you can strain it if you want to. [CLS] [SEP]or you can just pull them out like this and discard them .
okay , in this one we 're going to go over a three step movement to the front corner .what you want to think about when you 're going to go with a three step , it 's going to be left foot first , right foot , which then sets up your lunge for the final shot , to the , with the third step .so this is very , very good to .now if you 're right here , let 's say you get a ball that 's short , you might even do a two step .so it 's really the same as the four step movement to the ball , but we 're taking out two of the steps because it 's still going to be right foot , left foot , and you cover .and there 's the occasional. [CLS] [SEP], you get a short ball and you just basically lunge , which is a one step .so all these things are great to practice .the four step is an awesome thing to practice because it puts you in a good position .it gives you good practice to get to the ball properly .the three step is a really , really good thing to practice .so remember , three step 's right foot , left foot , right foot. [CLS] [SEP]and you hit that ball .and then there 's going to be times when it 's really just one step .so it 's always a matter of staying at the tee , staying in balance. [CLS] [SEP]so you 're in a perfect position to cover all those shots .because the front court , when you move properly , gets a lot smaller .if you move improperly , see i moved improperly , i was slow .i could n't get to that ball .but if i move properly , there really is n't a ball that i ca n't. [CLS] [SEP], i ca n't get to in a strong position to be able to hit a good shot .
the important thing on a book that is like that ; a biography , a science book ; a history book is that you make them interesting , this is where you really have to capitalize on your loud , soft ; high , low ; fast , slow and operative words if you 're putting a book like that on tape .if you are putting a fiction book on tape or a story on tape. [CLS] [SEP]everything changes because that 's where we 're going to start introducing character voices .the thing about character voices is this ; every character must have a slightly different voice and as you create character voices you want to think in terms in slight differences , they do n't have to be huge differences ; think it terms of differences in pitch , in speed ; in volume but the most important thing about character voices is that you can maintain consistency .do not create ; create a voice that you can not maintain threw out the entire book or story that you 're putting on tape .the next thing that you need to remember is that your voice should be the narrator voice and when you 're doing books on tape. [CLS] [SEP]all the lines like `` she said '' are done in the narrator voice .`` i 'm playing my character voice. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm telling john to come here ''she said ; you always go back to your narrator voice on the narration parts .
ok.so , there are three types of pressures that we use when we 're working on a horse .light pressure to warm up with .moderate pressure to kind of really work the area .heavy pressure as a horse gets used to the moderate pressure and then back down to a light pressure as a closing stroke .so , let 's look at spy 's chest , for instance .when i 'm working on this , i 'll start by doing light pressure , just back and forth to get him used to me touching him there and get used to the sensation of what i 'm doing .moderate pressure .and heavy pressure .and what that 's going to do is really get the blood circulation going in that area .the impact of my hand is going to help loosen up the muscle tissues .and then you back down again to lighter pressure to close with .
the stance that we 're going to be learning today is called our steel stance .the steel stance is mainly used to go ahead and advance forwards without bringing your body weight through the position .to perform the steel stance , melissa is going to go ahead , and let me have you turn to face this , melissa .let me have your feet twice the width of your shoulders .the same distance that we would be for our bow and arrow stance or our horse stance .bring them in just a little bit closer , right there .ok , placing the hands onto your waist .now , this is a twisting position , so melissa is going to turn her head this way , she 's going to allow her left foot to turn all the way out totally in this direction .at this point , she 's going to bring this shoulder forward , turning , and she 's going to shift away forward , and look over your this way .there we go .this way .now , this leg is straight , with your heel pointing up .this knee is bent , and we want to try to keep the knee over the ankle .now this position , in the beginning , this is a fine level to start at .eventually we want to work it to where our thigh is level with the floor .want to relax the torso , right , and relax your ribs so you get a nice , good twist .this is how we perform our steel stance in kung fu .
one of the most dangerous places. [CLS] [SEP], i think for children to be alone , are in public restrooms .probably the best way to avoid public restrooms is to have your children go , before you leave the house .if you have a very young child , a toddler , up to toddler age , or up actually , up to about four or five , you can actually carry a potty in the car .not that you would let your four or five-year-old go into a bathroom .in fact , no children should be allowed to go into the bathroom by themselves , under the age of ten , into public restrooms .but , one of the easiest ways to deal with using the bathroom with a younger child is carrying a potty in the car .if your child is just too big for something like that , then you really are going to want to always accompany your child into the bathroom .it 's never safe for you to just send your child in and even wait outside .there have been cases of things happening to children , while adults stand outside of the bathroom .so , that 's a very safe , important tip , and also if you have an older child , particularly a daughter , you 're going to want to encourage her to always go to the bathroom , with a friend .if she 's out shopping , or at the mall , or just having fun with her friends , it 's ...there 's always safety in numbers .so , always encourage your kids to use public restrooms with caution , and with a buddy .
as you 're learning how to spin poi , it might not be obvious at first. [CLS] [SEP]but the awareness of the upswing and the downswing of the poi are very important in manipulating them to move in different directions .if you 're having a hard time turning. [CLS] [SEP]just think about exaggerating the downswing and the upswing until you get an intuitive feel for it .if i 'm going to be turning with my poi spinning forward , down , and then with them spinning backwards , up .it 's actually helpful to have your whole body get into the down and the up , to get the feeling of when the timing is for the poi to move .down , up .let your body lead you as you feel the weight going down and up and eventually , you should be able to turn in a full circle in both directions .while you may have to think about it a lot , at first , after some practice it will just become natural .
now i 'm going to show you some more scales to improvise over the key of b flat .first of course is the key of b flat major scale 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7 , just go on and get it under your fingers .then using the bebop technique you can add in side notes , those little chromatic passing tones .for you people who do n't know what chromatic passing tones is chromatic means using every note , the passing tone is using a note outside of the scale to get into the next note into the scale .you got the bebop blue scale , the top of the black notes. [CLS] [SEP]2 bottom are the other 2 black notes .2 white notes in between and on the top 2.so you got top 2 , top 2 , and the 2 notes in between .then you got your hexitonic scale which uses the triad below the b flat , the a triad is a half step below .so you have all these half steps .so those are just some hip scales to play over the b flat , feel free to experiment , try to find your own chords .in the book of scales there is over 15 ,000 scales able to be played. [CLS] [SEP]so let that number of scales come in from your own playing and get your own sound develop .but you got to get your pallet done first .
so earlier i taught you how to start a yoyo dead by hitting it on the string , i think it looked like this , and that 's a great way to start a yoyo .and like i said it 's a cool way to start a yoyo. [CLS] [SEP]it 's a lot cooler than winding a string .but truth is , the coolest way to start a yoyo is by snap starting it .it looks like this .you hold a yoyo like this in between your hands , it 's like snapping your thumbs .you want to practice that .you do n't have to be able to snap your thumbs to be able to do this trick. [CLS] [SEP]so do n't worry if you ca n't do this all ready .it 's just kind of the motion .so just do that with your fingers anyways to get the feel of it .what you do is you hold the yoyo in between your thumb and your middle and pointer finger .hold it just like so. [CLS] [SEP]and you use your thumb to snap the yoyo off like that .that 's what 's giving it all that spin .so watch me here as i take my thumb and pointer. [CLS] [SEP]and i push up with my thumb as i 'm holding it with my middle and pointer finger , like so .and see how fast it gets spinning from that .and from there you know you can go right into tricks. [CLS] [SEP], it 's great in a performance if you get a knot. [CLS] [SEP]you can just snap it and go right into a trick .another impressive thing to do with a snap start , that i like to do is when i snap it. [CLS] [SEP]i pop it up .it kind of shoots it right into the air. [CLS] [SEP], like that , you can even like shoot it up and catch it into loops and stuff like that with a little bit of practice .it 's definitely something worth practicing .i 'll try it again from this angle just so you guys get the feel for it .pop up like that , thumbs coming up , pointers are holding it in place as i snap , really get that forward pushing motion with your thumb , that 's going to help you out .and once you 've got that down , and people see you do that , it looks like magic .that 's a snap start .
in this clip , we 're going to talk about the proper service procedure in order to remove and replace a broken cv joint also known as a drive shaft on a front-wheel drive vehicle .in this step , we 're going to talk about the proper service procedure for reinstalling your vehicle 's wheel and snugging of your lug nuts .what i 'm going to do is just take and roll the wheel over and line it up with the studs .i 'm going to grab a hold of it here in one of the vented portions of the rim .look through the holes and line it up on the studs .i 'm going to grab some lug nuts here .i 'm going to take and use my foot to hold the wheel flat against the hub assembly .take a lug nut .i like to start one on the bottom first .what that will do is hold it from cocking out. [CLS] [SEP]and then i do n't have to use my foot any longer just like so .there 's no particular order. [CLS] [SEP]when starting your lug nuts or snugging the wheel down , however there is when you torque the wheel .alright .once you have all your lug nuts started , you can use your four way and snug them up .now when you 're snugging them .i 'm going to go from there up to here .from there to here .and for the last one .alright , that is the proper service procedure for reinstalling your wheel and snugging up of your lug nuts .
calab labarda :alright , the next section we 're going to do we 're going to go over helicopter spins , making it more advance .so , before helicopter spins at one , two , doing our l strikes like that , one , two .now , we 're going to practice doing it in 360 's and changing up levels .what i mean changing up levels , i mean , going on to your knees , changing of levels , okay .so , that 's going to look a lot better instead of doing your whole form , standing up , switching directions , bam , changing levels , doing helicopter spins , alright .let 's go ahead and break that down .so , first , make sure you got your l strikes down with the correct spin and do helicopter spins , bam , bam ,okay , makes you go into a 360 , alright .now , let 's go and practice going on to our knee .okay .let 's go and face the direction of our right .so , drop on to one knee , we 're going to a first bout using our nunchucks , come together , knees together .okay , now , i 'm in an angle .i 'm going to face all the way to the back .bring one knee around , okay .now , i 'm going to drop that one back again , bring the other knee up to back to standing position , and stand .so , i did a complete 360.so , one more time , we 're going to go a little faster .drop one , two , three , four , alright .you must have that section down before moving on .now , do n't drop too hard and bang your knees .drop it real smooth .okay , you do n't want it choppy .now , we do it with nunchucks .we 're going to do l strikes , okay ?drop one , crisscross. [CLS] [SEP]right here as you spin , helicopter spin , around , switch , two come around , three , come around again , four .okay , so again here we go , helicopter spin , drop , one , every time i spin , two , three , come across , four .okay .do you see all the helicopter spins. [CLS] [SEP]i did in there ?so like , one , two , three , four , as i spin all the way back around , and that is going to be your knee helicopter spins changing up levels .
in this clip we 're going to speak about affirm relaxer .affirm is a relaxer that is been around a very long time .it 's from the company avlon and they have different types of relaxers .the fiberguard relaxer is very important because what it does is it goes ahead and brings back the elasticity into the hair , and when it is relaxed , you know the hair loses some elasticity , gets more porous .well what affirm has developed here in this , in this a great product is a formula that goes ahead and strengthens the hair after the relaxer .and. [CLS] [SEP]so they 've come up with this product. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's called fiberguard .they also have many other products , and this is actually for sensitive scalp , but they have another product for hair that has sensitivity to relaxer and that has problem scalp .so you have different types of relaxer from affirm .it also comes in a large tub that 's not fiberguard .thank you .this has been liz muller .
hey there back again , some healthy tips for a good night sleep which we all can use for rejuvenation .big one is food allergies or even food sensitivities .you 'll be surprised how those can interrupt your sleep patterns or your sleep at all .the best thing to do is if you 're allergic to any of these type things , you know the soy , the diary , the gluten products , the nuts or the peanuts especially , shellfish , all of those that tend to be , people have food allergies to , even corn. [CLS] [SEP], you want to be sure to avoid those .even better if you can avoid them for at least 30 days , this way you really know if it 's interrupting your sleep patterns and you can get a better night sleep in the interim. [CLS] [SEP]and i ca n't say that word .but anyway , so make sure to avoid these , it 'll really helps out for you and it 's much healthier for you .additionally if you want to , just go ahead. [CLS] [SEP]and maybe you can go ahead. [CLS] [SEP]just change these up a little bit .so instead of having your milk or dairy at night , have a nice caramel tea , caramel is very helpful , very relaxing for the body instead of maybe your gluten grains or something like that , have a little bit of brown rice or just a little bit of rice in general .it 'll be nice and helpful for you and it helps to give your that carbs .instead of your peanuts , maybe have some almonds or for soy , try other meat substitutes , chicken is always good especially turkey for that extra trytophane , trytophane , good luck .
once i have steel wooled my entire project , i 'm going to come through with a tack cloth and rub that over my project .now this is going to pick up any of the steel wool fragments or any other wood chips that might be on my project .after i 've gone over my entire project with that tack cloth , i 'm going to come back and put my second coat of finish on. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]using a four inch wide foam brush to do this .you just want to make sure you get nice even coats and that your coverage is pretty consistent .after we put our second coat on , we 're going to let it dry for twenty four hours , we 're going to come back and. [CLS] [SEP]steel wool it again. [CLS] [SEP], tack cloth it again and then apply a third coat. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 'll be finished .
as a kid , i worked in the plaza with the famous danielle belair who was fanatically a great chef and probably one of the best in the world .he would be fanatical about this .always cleaning your plate up gives you a chance to taste it .but here 's a little way to make it look nice .just take a fork and just pat it down with a fork ; it gives it some nice lines .how much does this cost ?it 's pretty cheap to make .it 's only potatoes and eggs , your basic .this salad will probably serve 8 to 10 people for less than 15 bucks to make .i put a little sprig with parsley just like that in the corner .it gives it a little color .that 's it .it 's ready to go .here is how i store it too .simple storage is just cutting it like so .put this on top .you can store it in a tupperware .this will stay good for a week in your refrig .i do this on friday morning. [CLS] [SEP]and i take it out sunday afternoon .are you ready for some football ?i 'll bring the potato salad ; american potato salad here on expert village .
many ways i can show you where i actually incorporate a lot of the equipment .let me show you something really basic , really easy , so you have at least something to use no matter where you are .because you can take this even traveling , right ?alright , basic bicep curls .the key on this , is that you have enough resistance .i have a pretty hard tube , tight tube .so my feet are close together .so just curling up , with my elbows in , is pretty difficult .if this was a tube that perhaps was stretched out , i would have to step apart further .right ?i 'd have to step apart further to get more resistance .another variation on the bicep curl , would be to take it both , one arm .definitely difficult .i can also twist it where my thumb is on top , and i 'm coming up with a hammer curl .there 's a lot of variations .i can take it out to the side more .but this is your basic bicep curl with the tubing .lets move to tricep , which is the opposing muscle .and i 'm going to show you from the side .now , again , resistance is critical , it 's key .it depends where you step on the tubing .if i step closer to the handle , harder to do .if i step further away from the handle , easier to do .i 'm going to try just right in the middle to start .i 'm going to keep my elbow in , by my side. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to bend both knees , i 'm going to look straight ahead , and i 'm going to simply kick it back .notice my wrist position , and now notice my wrist position is going to change , look at it now .see the change ?palm back , and then palm facing the body .can i do both arms at the same time ?yes i can .is it much harder ?absolutely .bend your knees , straight back .now , for this i 'm twisting in and out with my wrist .a lot of ways to do it .here 's the key .be careful not to take it out to the side , keep it in tight .upper part of my arm does not move .a kick back , simply means that you 're kicking back your arm .okay .a kickback .i have other exercises with the tubing for tricep , and we 'll get into that at another time .right now this is enough to really work your bicep and your tricep .
so a little bit earlier on in some other series you might have seen me lift my pinky finger a little bit when i was first showing you the bow hold .this is just to show that the pinky finger is really a stabilizer. [CLS] [SEP]but really if you have a strong bow grip you find that the pinky finger does n't really need to be there at all .now you can actually hold the bow without it , when you 're playing however you should have your pinky finger down .this is just to show stability and after you 've been practicing your bow hold for a while that your hand should start to stabilize and you 'll find after a while your pinky finger really is kind of a guiding finger like this .so you can lift it up and down and everything else stays the same .really it 's your other four fingers that are helping to balance your bow especially your thumb that 's coming up from the bottom .but one thing you can try that will teach you stability in your bow a , maybe after you 've been practicing your bow hold for a while. [CLS] [SEP]is to try lifting your , your , pinky finger up just a little bit .this will show the stability that you have in your bow hold .it also shows that your other fingers are positioned nicely on the bow .
we are going to now assemble the bell-hiller mixing mechanism .and amazingly enough , this is , most of these parts are parts you 're going to find on a full scale aircraft .and they 're absolutely necessary to the proper operation .you saw that i just put the shoe goop in these holes .there 's two bearings that go in here with this tiny , tiny brass washer between them .all absolutely necessary to the proper operation .i 'm going to go ahead , install the bearings .ok , i 've put the bearings in the bell-hiller mixing arms .i 've put the ball , the ball links on the ends , and it 's time to fasten it to the rotor head .now , once again , proper orientation is hugely important .look at the drawing , look at the picture .make sure your parts are in the same orientation and that everything looks exactly the same .if it does n't , somethings wrong .ok.i 've assembled the bell-hiller mixing arms to the see-saw , the flybar see-saw here .and then the last step here is to put on these ball links .now the drawing very specifically calls out 32mm .the best way to measure them is with the digital calipers , this 31.96.so that 's pretty close to 32 .31.90 , now actually , those are about as close as you 're going to get to 32 , because of the thread distances , if i screw it out a full turn it will be far in excess of that .so that 's about as close as we 're going to get .ok , i 'm going to use the ball link pliers to install these .once again , under the link , press down firm force , pops right on .make sure that these are in the proper orientation with the drawing , so that the arm is on the right side of the rotor head .pop on the second one , just like that .and then you can see how those interconnect and move together .i 'm going to do that to the other side , and then we 're going to move on with the assembly .
jason jeanette. [CLS] [SEP]: by tactical , we mean street-applicable and not sport-applicable .mixed martial arts has a unified set of rules that does n't allow eye gouges , biting , groin strikes , things like that , which are very handy tools to have in a street fight or a life-or-death situation .in a mixed martial arts match , i can hold someone down for five minutes and hit them and win the match ; but in a street fight , if there are other people around that are not on my side , that would be trouble .daniel klapheke : our system is a mixture of muay thai kickboxing , brazilian jiu-jitsu , wrestling , and some israeli hand-to-hand fighting .and what we 're going to be showing you today. [CLS] [SEP]is a version of the sport fighting and a version of the street fighting , so we 'll show you two different versions each time .
today i 'm going to help you look how to create an intention .what is an intention ?an intention is something that you seek out to have .an intention is something that you set forth .say we 're talking about golf , and of course brad is a top one hundred golf instructor in the country , so we will be talking to him in just a moment about the intention that he has set for himself regarding his golf game .so how you create an intention is you look at where you want to be , not where you 're not , where you wish you could be ,where you hope you could be , but exactly where you want to be .it all begins with believing that you can be where you want to be .that 's how you begin creating an intention .so brad , let , let me ask you , what intention do you want to create regarding your golf game ?well i want to be able to play competitive golf with not. [CLS] [SEP], i do n't have a lot of time on my hands like what i used to .so i need to be more efficient with my time. [CLS] [SEP]and i want to keep my competitive game at a good level where i can have fun .very good .so he wants to work on his golf game knowing that he may not have the time he used to have to dedicate to playing competitively , yet he wants to see himself as a competitive golfer , all the while having fun .do you see that this is different from where he may have been ?perhaps in the past he was playing golf and feeling like he could n't have all of that .but instead , we 're looking to create an intention .an intention of something positive of where you want to go .now brad , does it feel different to speak as if you are where you already want to be which is different than remembering where you used to be ?at first it certainly felt different and very weird , but now i 've become so accustomed to it and it feels good .great .so it feels awesome to create where you want to be and act as if you 're already there .great .that is exactly how you create an intention .look to say where it is that you want to be instead of saying where it is that you are now .
okay now our meat is done and i 'm just going to spoon it onto a preparation plate here .the next step would be to crack 1 egg into the bowl. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'm going to add a little bit of sesame oil just a tiny little bit a dash .i 'm going to add a dash of soy. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to add some sesame seeds .then i 'm going to shake them in just a pinch .okay then i 'm going to mix that up getting a whisk .the thing we are doing is making a little omelet .that is then going to be dumped in a pan with some olive oil in it .better is great for frying a egg. [CLS] [SEP]it is certainly a better way to do it in oil. [CLS] [SEP]but we do n't want that buttery taste in our gimbap. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm going to use the oil .we are basically going to let that egg sit there until it is done .and rinse out our bowl .
and i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]an actress and acting coach here in the new york city .in this clip i 'm going to talk about how to find dvd clubs .if you 're an actor you 're trying to research films .well you could rent of course. [CLS] [SEP], you go to netflex.com. [CLS] [SEP]and you know , subscribe or go to block buster rents or you can buy and join a club .and in that way you can you know , own movies and watch them over and over , study acting at various reduced prices .so , i 'm going to talk about four different dvd movies clubs .columbiahouse.com , get five dvds for only forty nine cents each , for example , columbiahouse.com .another one is the disney dvd club here , if you want to specialize in dvd disney movies .here you get four disney movies for only one ninety nine each .timelife.com is another one that has a lot of excellent quality films .and the film movement which specializes , it 's just www.filmmovement.com .which specializes in independent and foreign films , so for the more artsy actor in you .dvd clubs basically work that you subscribe monthly , you buy a dvd and you get a reduced rate .this has been athena reich in new york city .
 , how do you want to be seen ?you want to realize that this is a business situation , a business opportunity and it is going to be a business decision by the director and the casting agent that you are working with .you are being hired for a job , it is that simple .be professional , be courteous , just as you would at a job interview .if people demand difference , you need to be polite to them and make sure that you are .be responsible , be clean and polite in your appearance .the unfortunate truth about life is that you never get a second chance to make a first impression .so , be prompt , courteous , attentive , pleasant , cheerful ,no matter how things go , be cheerful and patient .as one matter of etiquette , the director might not want to be spoken to .you can generally speak to the stage manager , who is running things or to the person who is in the front office immediately as you come in for the audition .the important thing is to be secure in what you have to offer and that will make sure that you are not going to be anxious or rude or needy or impolite .so , it is very important that you are going to be hired for a job because that is what the audition is , be professional , show your professionalism throughout the entire process .
all right , now we 're going to do the `` hook step '' .it looks like this : basic two , three , five , six , seven , one , two , three , five , six , seven , basic two , three .we can also add a lunge here : one , two , three , five , six , seven. [CLS] [SEP]-- it 's just a small flair -- two , three , five , six , seven .ok ?breaking it down , after you do your basic six , seven. [CLS] [SEP], you 're going to cross over on one , you 're going to angle your body to the side and do a rock step two , three .repeat on the other side : cross over five , side rock six , seven back to basic one , two , three , five , six .again we go : cross , rock step , cross , rock step , basic one , two , three , and five , six , seven .ok. [CLS] [SEP]and if you want to add the flair to it , here 's what 's going to happen .after you cross on one ( and you want to bend your knees on that cross ) , you 're going to take your weight back onto your left foot , lunge a little bit , ok , bend your knee , and point the right foot .ok so this is two , and then you step forward three .ok.repeat on the other side .you cross five , take your weight back to the right foot , bend the knee , six , point this left toe , and seven , basic one , two , three .so that flair position , it 's really important that your weight is centered completely over the standing leg , with that knee bent , and the other leg is extended straight with the knee pointing forward , and the toe pointed .ok ?so here 's your flair on this side , and here 's your flair on this side .that 's what it should look like .you do n't want to tilt either direction .you want to keep your body straight up and down .ok ?so one more time : one , two , three , five , six , seven .we 've got cross , flair step , cross , flair step , and one , two , three , five , six , seven .
but you really want to put thin coats and multiple coats in order to do it properly .when i am doing a repair spackle , you get a decent amount , put it on the area that you are looking to repair .just going to turn around here .once i smooth it in to the cracks that need to be repaired , then you smooth it out .
today we 're going to learn how to make hoop earrings .hoop earrings is one of the most simplest type of earrings you could make , especially if you buy your hoop .this is an example of a hoop that i bought at a craft store .it 's just a blank hoop and does n't have anything fancy on it .you can actually make this kind of hoop on your own .all i 'm going to do is add a couple of beads .i 'm going to add one small one. [CLS] [SEP]and then a larger one for an accent .then i 'm going to add another small one .it opens and closes .whenever you 're adding the beads , you want to turn the hoop to the side .you never want to pull the hoop out , but that 's going to take away its really circular shape .all you have to do to put it in your ear is to slide this through your ear and clasp it right there , and that is your hoop earring .that is how you make a hoop earring .
alright .and , now we 're getting down to the actual design elements .and , in order to get you started i 'm going to show you how to draw some different types of necklines .these are all just basic jumping off points for you to begin with and to build your own drawings and designs upon .obviously , you do n't want to copy me .and , there 's many many other styles than the ones. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm just going to show you .but , i will show you some basic ones and how to draw them .the first one we 're going to do , is the round or jewel neckline .which , when drawn looks like this .that 's how it 's completed .and , in order to draw it. [CLS] [SEP]we 're going to do the smile at the neckline .and , like i was talking to you. [CLS] [SEP]about earlier you want it to be three dimensional .so , above the smile part if it 's going around. [CLS] [SEP]somebody 's back. [CLS] [SEP]you need to make it go up a little there along the neckline .up a little bit there along neckline , connecting back like that dotted line that we had .and , then swoop down .swoop down .and , there 's your basic round or jewel neckline right there .
the threat we 're going to address in this series is when the child is being lifted from behind in a bear hug situation and he needs to defend himself .so what 's going to be happening. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to grab oscar , as soon as i get him off the ground he 's going to take his outside leg and wrap it around mine very tightly. [CLS] [SEP]and he 's going to kick the groin with his other foot .as soon as i put my foot down he 's going to move to the side , strike my groin and turn and face me as soon as possible , keep kicking , keep hitting , make space and get away .do n't touch me !stay away !get off of me !one thing to keep in mind as you 're doing the training and watching us do these exercises is in the real world it 's not going to be perfect , it 's not going to be pretty and things will be missed .the key element to this technique , the first thing that needs to happen is you need to get this leg trapped .if this leg is not trapped i 'm free to move the child wherever i want .by trapping the leg with his , with his own leg. [CLS] [SEP]it kind of pins him to me .he 's going to kick the groin , that very important because without that strike there 's no way i would have a reason to put him down .as soon as he is back on the ground he 's going to punch his hips back , aggressively strike the groin again , turn , get away as fast as possible .he wants to turn and be looking at me before he takes off. [CLS] [SEP]so i ca n't just grab him by the hair or the back of the shirt .he wants to do damage , make space and escape .
everyone loves it .and you could ask people who are from that era , what are the hit songs , because that 's what you want to do .you want to get those most popular tunes .then you can go to the internet and you can listen to the radio stations for just for the 50 's tunes .and you want to be careful when you 're picking the tunes , that it 's right for your vocal range .okay ?now , some things that i 've done is gone into the record shop and i 've picked up these tapes .you might want to target a particular person , like elvis or bobby darin .we have little anthony , very popular tunes .and then , there 's generic , like just the 50 's or ,oh this is so much fun , grease .now , if you ca n't find tunes from grease , everybody loves this , even the younger generation knows of the songs from grease .in the next section , we 'll be talking about how to produce these in the studio .so , you 've got to come back .is n't this fun .
we 're going to talk about time stretching now .time stretching is applied when you have a sample that is a certain size. [CLS] [SEP]and you want it to be another size , but you do n't want to pitch shift it because you like how it sounds the way it is .i 'll show you how to make it longer or shorter without changing the pitch and doing a bunch of other cool stuff in the process .using the sampler with this particular sound is called hit. [CLS] [SEP]underscore g s.it 's part of the free loops package you can find .that 's what it sounds like by itself .now normally if i want to make it longer , i would do that .i would just change the pitch here , i would bring it down .i 'd bring it down five notes .so if it were a c , now it 's a g.it made it longer , but it also changed the notation .now for this particular sound it probably would n't matter very much .but if it were a sound that had an actual tone , that could ruin a song .so what you do is you go down here to this window called time stretching .you do n't want to do resample because resample is what we just did .so we 're going to go to pro default , which is another selection like with the slicer where free loops does all the proper corrections itself .so now i 'm going to go to time and make it really long .plainly tell that is way too long .so we go down a little bit , just a tiny bit .not as long , and you can also make it shorter if you only push it a little bit .play with that , you have to play with that really to get what you want .but that 's how you would do it .
let 's take a look .now , we 're going to learn this introductory phrase in two parts .now when the song begins , the bass starts playing .but when randy rhoads kicks in his guitar , this is the phrase that you play , okay ?so your index finger on the 2nd fret of the low e string , your ring finger on the 4th fret of the a string , then we 're going to use our pinkie to come to the 5th fret and come back off .okay ?we 're palm muting all of these , which means you just lay the side of your hand lightly against your strings ,okay ?we 're going to hit that low e string twice ,then to the 4th fret of the a , back to the e string , then to the 5th fret of the a string , back to the 2nd fret of the e string , 4th fret a string , 2nd fret e string .that phrase sounds like this .okay ?then the next phrase , we 're going to bring that index finger to the 2nd fret of the a string and kinda switch it around .we 're going to use the pinkie on the 5th fret of the e string and our ring finger on the 4th fret of the same string , where it 's going to go 2nd. [CLS] [SEP]fret a string. [CLS] [SEP]then 5th fret. [CLS] [SEP]e string , 4th fret. [CLS] [SEP]e string , back to 5th fret and again , then you end up on an open e string .okay ?slowly , those two riffs together sound like this .open string , back .to speed , that riff sounds like this .join us in our next segment , we 're going to take a look at a rock and roll great .it 's `` johnny b. [CLS] [SEP]goode '' by chuck berry .i 'll see you there .
so in the final step of putting together our bunraku arm control , what i 've done is to bend two little pieces of wire , drill a couple of holes and stick them in there .and you can a drop of crazy glue to hold those in place .i 'm going to take some lengths cut intentionally a little extra long of the dacron cord .tie a square knot at the very least , that 's right over left , left over right to attach the string to those homemade little eye screws .and then i 'm going to thread my dacron through my brass tubes .already done the other one .this is number two .all the way down to the other end .i 'm going to pass it , whoops , pass it through from the underside .so from the same side that the ,and i 've put a little hot glue on that stubborn cotter pin you can see .wrap it around through that divot. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 're going to tie a knot .i like to wrap it twice .and you 'll notice that i did that with the wrist extended , the hand extended straight and the dowel at ninety degrees .i 'm going to do the same thing with the other guy held in the same position .and then tie it off. [CLS] [SEP]so we can move the dowel , so we can move the wrist .so , you 're going to tie those knots .
this is our ride cymbal stand .we 're going to set up this other arm , and we 're going to loosen here and then pull this arm all the way up. [CLS] [SEP]and then you just kind of get it a little close , you know , as the rest of everything .we 'll adjust later .so we got that tight , and then we will go ahead and loosen this .this is the head ; get it to where we think it might be a decent angle .and loosen these two guys .same thing , it pulls out .it 's a space saving stand ; go ahead and put that back in .and then we 're going to tighten .so now , it 's not -- it ca n't move back or forth , but it can still do this , so we got to tighten this as well .and let 's see here .they look -- this looks like it could probably go back a little bit .so i 'm going to keep that there .and i want to adjust the head too , take it down a little bit with the angle and tighten it back up .and i think that looks pretty close for right now .we wo n't be able to tell until we get the cymbals on .
we ? re going to discuss a little bit about romance and astrology and this does not necessarily mean that astrology can create a romantic situation .but , there has to be a certain amount of romance. [CLS] [SEP]and there is already romance involved when people coming together .it may not be the same. [CLS] [SEP]but we are pretty free individuals that like to have self expression. [CLS] [SEP]so most of us can feel passion and romance .it is how we express it. [CLS] [SEP]that 's important .some signs express it more so than other signs. [CLS] [SEP]but , in all signs there can be romance and there can be passion and there can be excitement .so when we say romance in astrology , it does n't mean that it is just for cancer people or sagittarians or piscesians or leos , that all twelve signs have the ability to be romantic its just what level the one wants to be on and the endurance to maintain that romance .if the person can accept this then that 's fine .but to have on going romance you would have to look for that in specific signs .but romance already does exist so ; there is romance within the sign for each sign .and , all signs carry the romance ability and the passion and the excitement and the sexuality. [CLS] [SEP]it is just how it is expressed that 's really important .now when you think about romance in astrology you have to thin about the romance and the passion that exist within spirit .there is already a romance to life ; it 's a romance of living .this is explained through atlas , this is the celestial globe which has all the constellations .each symbol that you look at has romance that leads into other signs all the time .this entire globe is actually constantly moving .this just stops it for a small , small time in life but each symbol , one moves into the other , which creates movement and which creates passion and which creates change and transformation .so when you think of astrology you can ?t think of as fixed as this is but. [CLS] [SEP]the way that this picture is everything is within movement , everything is constantly changing within the movement to give like a romance to life .
there 's four different types of fire you can learn , and use them in different scenarios .if you want to cook , the best fire for you is use the log cabin fire .this is really good , because the log cabin fire is really ventilated , so it gets a lot of oxygen , which helps put off more heat , but most importantly is the logs freely fall on top of each other as they burn , and they make really , really good pieces of coal that put off really good heat , to where you can transfer them ; put them on top of a dutch oven , up under it in a different location .second type of fire is a tepee fire .this is going to be great in case. [CLS] [SEP]you are really cold .snowy climates this is good , because this puts really good heat off .it concentrates the heat into the area right surrounding you ; does n't dissipate very really very fast , so the tepee fire. [CLS] [SEP], you just pile it up just like a indian tepee , and let it burn , and it 'll keep you really , really warm .third type of fire is going to be your lean-to fire .this is when you have the big type , big log beside your fire pit , and you prop other limbs on this .this is going to put off good heat , but it 's also going to help light the area. [CLS] [SEP]really well .if your tent 's on one side of the log , put your fire on that side , and that log will block the heat and the light , and it 'll mainly force it towards your side of the campground to where you light your area really well .and you just want to keep piling wood on this. [CLS] [SEP]so it burns really , really bright , and always has a tall flame .and the fourth type of fire you can build is a signaling fire .with a signaling fire you want to sort of combine your log cabin and your tepee .this is so you have a really big base , and it burns really bright , and that you have an area that you can throw stuff on top of to make your signaling .and this is how you can demonstrate different types of fire .
some desert dwelling animals like to burrow a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]so i like to provide a little bit of depth .the rodent requires about 2 1/2-3 '' of bedding simply because you are going to be removing a lot of it while you are spot cleaning. [CLS] [SEP]and they used it to form themselves a nest .so that is really important for their well being. [CLS] [SEP]and then the jungle earth here. [CLS] [SEP]i like to put about 2 '' on the bottom of this .it 's easily cleaned up so when you do spot clean you are not going to be removing a whole lot of the bedding .the animals that are in these types of terrariums do n't like to burrow. [CLS] [SEP]so there is no need for a 3 '' depth .for the aspen snake bedding i like to put at least 3 ''deep simply because the snakes that live in that type of bedding are burrowers .they like to hide under it. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's a source of security for them. [CLS] [SEP]so providing that depth is pretty important .for animals such as turtles that live in burrows. [CLS] [SEP]naturally i like to use the pete moss and douglas fur bark .it 's like a soil. [CLS] [SEP]it 's not actually chunks of bark. [CLS] [SEP]it 's a actual soil. [CLS] [SEP]and i provide for 5 '' of depth for them to be able to provide a depth in which they can burrow and feel comfortable .
on stage , cast size is usually limited .we 'll look at some exceptions on this rule as well .in the modern theater , you usually want to have four to six characters in your play .that gives the actors a chance to have a meaty role .and also , if you 're a producing company , you want to get a play to where you 're probably not paying like 100 actors unless you 're on a broadway budget .in a cast size also to consider are the exceptions to the rule such as musicals or high school productions .it 's a big secret that musicals are probably the most lucrative form of theater ; they 're very spectacle orientated , and you can have a chorus line , and you can have all kinds of big events happening .and so , in musicals , you might require a lot a large cast. [CLS] [SEP]and you can get a large group of people to audition for a musical whereas a drama , you might have slightly smaller turnouts .also in high school , high schools are looking for a play that can encompass the entire class .you do n't want to have a four-person play , and then have the rest of the 20 students in the class having nothing to do .you can only have a few technicians and a few people on book , so at that point you want to have a large cast .you want to have something you get everyone involved .so there are exceptions to where you might want to go with a larger cast size .but traditionally , in the modern theater , if you 're writing a comedy or drama or something you want widely produced in colleges , in regional theaters and even on broadway , you probably want off of broadway , probably not broadway. [CLS] [SEP], you probably want to go with the four to six cast size .
and i might add -- go back and re-plop some red , but right now , i 'm just going to do a few big drops of white .not as many as the red 'cause i already have the whole piece of wood pretty much covered .so , i 'm just going to go with a few of the white plops. [CLS] [SEP]and then once i get those spread out. [CLS] [SEP]-- i only did , lets see , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight plops of the white .and so , when i get ready to squeegee in the next segment , you 'll see that i wo n't spread or cover nearly as much .but i did make these plops a little bit bigger so i will be able to cover a large area .and then if it 's too much white , i can always go back in and add red paint .and then , on the next color that i add , i 'm going to mix in a little bit of black .so , this is plopping the second color , and in the next segment , i will be squeegeeing , and then we 'll just keep moving and fill in this painting out and see what we 'll get .
in this clip we are going to talk about things to consider for families and students .if you have begun to look into home schooling that are considering teaching your own child at home , many times families do so in order to resolve an outside conflict .maybe there is a conflict at school or social problem or developmental problem with your child .maybe they need to learn patience or develop study skills .these are valid reasons why families might choose to teach their own children at home .you want to make sure you take into consideration hanging in for the process realizing that there are going to be things to work through. [CLS] [SEP]and there are going to be joys and benefits to home schooling .one of the greatest things to home schooling is the purpose to help teach our children self motivation and self direction .home schooling does n't require a parent teaching their child moment by moment but to help that child to learn how to become self motivated and things of life and direct themselves and learn how to follow instructions .these are important things to consider when families and students begin home schooling .
one of the things about water color pencils depending on the affect that you want to accomplish , if you want to keep a delicate line that you are going to just pull some color out of with some water. [CLS] [SEP]or you are doing an edging or something like that. [CLS] [SEP], you want to always make sure that the point of your pencil is really , really sharp .which means sometimes you ca n't work as fast as you like because you are always having to go back and sharpen your pencil .but that 's the affect that you want .so , make sure you keep your pencil sharpener handy and keep that point on there , once in a while it will break like that. [CLS] [SEP]but that will be a good chance , i can show you now what will happen you can see i can get a thick line and thin line out off of that .so , we 've got a thick line here and that might not be the affect that i am looking for .so , i want a real sharp pencil because i just want that one line like that. [CLS] [SEP]and there will be sometimes when i 'm working. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's all i need. [CLS] [SEP]is one line. [CLS] [SEP]and i need it to be real thin .so , that 's why i make sure i keep the pencil real sharp .you can go back in and you will get a nice , nice bold line. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's not too thick .where as if you go back into this one , it 's just a little thicker than you like it .so you want to know what affect you are going for , and if you need a sharp line make sure you keep sharpening that pencil because it will not hold the point for very long on this rough paper .
and i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]an actress and acting coach here in new york city .in this clip , i 'm going to talk about how to find monologues .it 's very important that you have a number of monologues ready your auditions .you 're going to need : contemporary monologues , shakespearean-classical monologues , comedic and dramatic .but , how do you find these monologues ?well , the best resource that i can recommend is dramabookshop.com .it does n't matter where you live , around the world , you can shop on-line .they do have a new york office if you live in new york city .they even have rush shipments .but , on dramabookshop.com , you will find hundreds of books that are compilations of monologues organized by gender , by age groups , you can find , you know , twenty-something female monologues , or you can , you know , whatever you want .also , you can go to , if you live in a city big enough to have a performing arts library , you can go to your local library and just look through the monologues , read them right there , and photo-copy them right there at the library .so , it 's just really important that you find a monologue that you relate to and that is appropriate so that you have a lot of options for auditions .this has been athena reich in new york city .
so the less you can move the better .that 's a good tenet to live by when you 're moving .so the more that you can find to sell or to donate or give away the better .so what i like to do is , if this option is available to you , you can go to your new house and or your new apartment. [CLS] [SEP]and you can measure , take measurements of the rooms and then put it up on graph paper .graph it out .so i did .i graphed my apartment , my new apartment on this sheet of paper .and then along the same lines i went ahead and measured my furniture and made little model pieces of furniture .and what this allows me to do is. [CLS] [SEP]it allows me to be able to kind of organize my furniture and to understand if i 'm going to be able to fit everything in to my apartment .and something that i found out is that i 'm not going to be able to fit any of my rugs unfortunately in to my new apartment .they just do n't fit in the spaces that i would like to put them in .so what that helps me know is that i can sell my rugs before i move. [CLS] [SEP]and then i wo n't have to move them .
here i have a pair of flared leg pants these are designed as jeans but the point of having flare legged pants is that is makes your legs look thinner .that 's one trick to minimize bigger legs. [CLS] [SEP]is to have them skinny along the leg. [CLS] [SEP]and then flare out at the bottom .it 'll make the overall look elongated and obviously with these kind of drawings , that 's not necessary but with a drawing like this and with a fashion model it just serves to reinforce that whole point even more so and almost like a character of a person .which is what they really are , but if you make your drawing extra skinny as a opposed to skinny drawing then it just drives home you 're whole idea to whoever your viewer is , to whoever you 're selling your collection to , to people who buying your collection .normally , woman want to look thinner , if you show them this they 're going to be like `` oh !those jeans , i want them , they make my legs look long , make my legs look thin '' .you 're mind. [CLS] [SEP]goes `` ah buy it '' and then cha-ching money for you the designer .
now i 'll discuss starting your own teleprompter business .when i started my business in dallas , texas in 1986 , there was not a lot of competition .dallas was a booming town in our industry .conventions , shows , commercials , and a great deal of corporate work to be had as well .before i started my business , i researched the market need in my city and even in nearby cities and states .i discovered there were just two teleprompter companies in the dallas/fort worth area .and only one had a computerized teleprompter at the time .there certainly was room for me .that year i attended nab or national association for broadcasters convention , and looked at all the teleprompter software and hardware companies there .i decided on telescript. [CLS] [SEP]and i 've used them ever since .my first computerized system was run on a commodore 64.my competition was running off of an atari .both of them were game computers , but at that time they could handle the graphics for teleprompting .in those days , seventeen inch monitors were used for shoots and shows .very heavy equipment indeed , but very effective .the cameras were larger and heavier too , so balancing the camera set up was less intensive .it took a few months , but once i got the word out that i was the new gal in town with a new computerized teleprompter system , my business took off .
today we 're going to do some demonstrations on how you can do creative coloring for your pet .we use completely safe nontoxic materials .one technique you will see we will wash off pretty much immediately .the other technique fades over time and it may take up to 6 weeks to wash off completely .okay , we 're back here with bella , our little yorkshire terrier , who 's actually grown to look a schnauzer .we had done her in the purple .you can see that on the darker hair , the purple really comes out almost like a highlight .then on the lighter coat , it comes out much more purpley .the deeper areas where we did n't work it in. [CLS] [SEP]so good .she has some of her natural coloring under there .it gives her a nice pretty layered look , and she 's all done .
you can take a plant which starts out as a bulb and just put it in a jar which contains water .if you do n't have a special jar that really contributes to the growth of a plant , you can just take any little small container , throw some water in it and just put your bulb in that water. [CLS] [SEP]and it will grow as you can see .and maybe if you get a small pot like this one , you can take this bulb and replant it into some soil into this pot .make sure that you keep the soil very very wet so that it is almost like living in a swamp and the plant will flourish .also if you have a small fish tank or fish bowl , you can get plants which grow in water .if you are taking a plant and putting it within a fish tank , be sure that you have the right kind of lighting which the plants need to grow .a lot of times people make a common mistake that a fish lamp which comes with most fish tanks is enough light to grow a plant within a fish tank .it is actually false .you will need a separate light to put over your fish tank in order for that plant to grow .but if you have a small fish bowl like this one , you can take a plant which once lived in soil such as a peace lily and submerge it in the water , place it under some rocks so that the roots have a place to go and you will notice in time that new sprouts and new leaves will grow and the plant will flourish there in the water .
we 're going to add on to our warrior sequence with a warrior 2 and a reverse warrior .from downward facing dog place the right foot next to your right hand in a low lunge .back heel on the floor .inhale by reaching the arms to the sky in a warrior 1.exhale open up into warrior 2.as you open up the left hip rotate toward the left side of the room if we 've got the right leg forward .important to keep the natural curve of the low back by blossoming the sit bones outward and the same time , very nice , pull the low belly in to counterbalance that action .then place the palm , right palm towards the sky inhale , and reach into a reverse warrior , very nice .keeping the front knee stable and the knee drawing towards your baby toe , the tendency is to collapse inward .can you show me a collapse for me debbie , yea on the knee ?really work to open that knee , strong base and a foundation .exhale both hands to either side of the leg , coming all the way back down into a downward facing dog .step forward with the left foot. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll do the same thing on the opposite side .inhale reaching overhead , exhale to warrior 2.very nice .hold for a breath here , very strong .warrior means to stand for something. [CLS] [SEP]so what is it in your mind that you are standing for ?firm , committed , turn the palm up , take the reverse warrior .very nice gentry , awesome .opening through the left side , pocket here stays at a 90 degree angle .beautiful .both hands to the floor and back in a downward facing dog .
i love it .i 'm just going to drizzle that all over the top .the whole thing .again , fold it all in .i 'm going to just put that in nice and easy .this is going to be some nice salad .i 'm just going to toss all this up all together .we 're actually going to put it back in the refrigerator for about 25-30 minutes .let it coat .if you really wanted to serve it , you could serve it now .it 's just nice when you get this all mixed up and let all these flavors fuse together .please go out and make this .it 's a really good one .
now , the round ones that you have , you can do two things with them .you can either form a roll or a french roll , we call it .roll it like that. [CLS] [SEP]and you have a nice roll .it will expand and it will get bigger , it will make a wonderful sandwich or you can flatten it , knock the air out of it a little bit and let it rise. [CLS] [SEP]and you 'll have a nice bun , like a hamburger bun .a nice heavy dough bun for your hamburger bun. [CLS] [SEP]or if you want to put some chicken , baked chicken , in the middle of it or. [CLS] [SEP]fried chicken. [CLS] [SEP]it 'll make a beautiful bun .so , from the dough , you can do all kinds of stuff. [CLS] [SEP], you can do a hamburger bun , you could do a french roll style or you could do your bagel and all of them would taste absolutely delicious and beautiful and wonderful .
there are many different drum sets , and when you 're a new time drummer , it can sometimes be very overwhelming because there 's so many different brands , so many different kinds of drum sets , it 's pretty crazy .but really it 's all about what kind of style of music you 're doing is what 's the best way to decide what kind of brand you want .there 's ibanez , the ludwig drum sets , but it all depends what style you 're doing .like if you 're getting in to a metal band you 'd want to get a bigger drum set , lots of toms and lots of cymbals do to all those fills and things like that .and a lot of times those are ibanez .for me personally in my band. [CLS] [SEP]i have ludwig which is simpler. [CLS] [SEP], there 's less drums , there 's not hundreds of cymbals and everything like that .i like to keep it simple .so , there are many different kinds , but really it all depends on what kind of style you 're looking for .and when you 're in a music store as well there 's also people to help you out with that as well .so , those are a few different kind of drum sets that i know about .
so here 's another red marker that shows us that we need to go up in this room .we can see that there is a portal-taking area up there , and that looks like pretty much it for the moment although we have a fan area up here .so maybe we should stop there first before we try to go all the way up .make our exit there and then entrance on the floor , we just hop right out .now we 're behind this fenced off area .and there 's a door. [CLS] [SEP]but of course it 's locked .and there is another piston here across the way that 's quite long .and we 're going to need to find a way to get on to that piston .so what we can do is make an exit here above it .at its point of being fully extended .and make our entrance here and just watch for the piston to come through .and jump on it when it gets close enough .now you can stay on this piston safely , it 'll go back and forth as long as you do n't move around too much , and we want to get up there across the way. [CLS] [SEP]so we can place an exit over here. [CLS] [SEP]and then we can use the height of this piston to do a momentum jump to take us across the way .
chinese writing is very different from most other languages in the world .in the chinese writing system , chinese symbols represent each character which corresponds to a single spoken syllable .a majority of words in all modern varieties of chinese require two or more characters to write .many chinese characters were adopted according to their meaning by the japanese and korean languages to represent native words , disregarding pronunciation altogether .chinese characters are also considered to be the world 's longest continuously used writing system .
if they did , you would have sort of ground beef , ground turkey soup which would still be just as delicious .but this is the traditional way .so you just drop them in one by one to the broth .i kind of like to re-roll them a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]and you do these with tongs if you do n't want to be too close to the broth .you just kind of drop them in there .they wo n't create too much of a splash .this gets them cooking sooner than all the other vegetables and things because you want to be able to cook the rice that is inside the meatballs .so we are going to re-roll them a little bit and then drop them in .
one more exercise with this incorporates the reverse lunge again but. [CLS] [SEP]this time , working more on the latissimus dorsi .so there 's a very common exercise we do in the fitness business called `` lat pulldown . [CLS] [SEP]''this exercise , pulling down , do the same thing here , incorporating a reverse lunge .you know , it would look like this , alternating like one side to the other .i 'm hinging forward slightly at the waist .
schmuel : when you 're making great macaroni and cheese from scratch , you make a roux .and a roux is a thickener that 's made by mixing butter and flour together and cooking it. [CLS] [SEP]and then you add your liquid to that , the milk and dairy and stuff .so we need for this recipe , we need a half of cup of butter .it goes into our sauce pan .and for this one , you need a large sauce pan because in this pan , we 're going to be combining all our boiled milk , our cheeses and our pasta .so make sure it 's big enough .and to that , we will add a half a cup of flour to the melted butter .it 's almost melted .we can just add that now like so , and you take your whisk. [CLS] [SEP]and you just whisk this together .i 'd say for about 5 minutes until it just starts to turn brown. [CLS] [SEP]'cause what happens is , you do n't want it to get too brown , 'cause you know how like brown butter tastes like brown butter and that will be a little bit too strong of a flavor of a roux for this .you can use darker roux flavors for different recipes , but like i said for this one , that would be a little bit too strong .so here we go , this is great .this is coming along very nicely .i 'll let you see how that looks , the roux .it 's just a flour and butter paste .absolutely lump free as it comes together .and we 'll just keep mixing this together .so keep clicking , and we 'll show you how what we add to the roux , okay ?keep clicking .
alright , what 's a good `` p '' word ?oh we have so many wonderful words in calligraphy .`` proportion '' , obviously the word proportion , you know having to do with a relative size of things , plays a very , very important place , and you must be very aware of this .`` patience '' is a really important word , it definitely takes patience to learn this , tremendous amount of patience .so what i would advise you is to be patient with yourself .i do n't think that many people think that way , they think about being patient with others , or being patient with something .but what i 'm going to say is in order to learn calligraphy , this needs to be paramount , you need to be patient with yourself . [CLS] [SEP]`` practice '' , is absolutely essential .there 's going to be no difference between practicing calligraphy and practicing any other thing that takes physical coordination and mind-fullness , so it 's going to be the same like playing a musical instrument , it 's going to be the same as doing a sport , dancing , swimming , whatever .`` passion '' and `` power '' ; if you do this enough , if you get to the point where you 're actually making beautiful letters and you 're discovering all the amazing wonderful things that you can do with calligraphy , you 're going to develop a passion for it , and this happens in all the arts .the power , the whole idea of power , i think has to do with the ability to make beautiful things , i consider that a great power , it 's not power over anyone else , it 's a personal power , and it 's a wonderful power .
so the next , to start adding to our four way coordination with jazz is to add a third limb .and what i 'm going to add , is the snare drum .i 'm going to play quarter notes on the snare .meaning , i 'm going to play , one , two , three , four on the snare drum .then combine it , with what 's going on , on our jazz ride pattern and the hi hat .so i 'll just put a couple measures of just the jazz ride pattern , we 've been playing .and then , i 'll just adding in .i 'm not slamming down .this is n't rock , i 'm not playing rim shots over on the snare drum .i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]just playing some light quarter notes on the snare drum .so this is a very basic coordination exercise .it will get that third limb involved .the snare 's not doing anything syncopated or anything weird .you 're just playing one , two , three , four .one , two , three , four .nothing crazy .and then , we can look at adding in the bass drum , next .
the quality depends a lot on where you 're going to be using the table .what i mean by that is a commercial table is very heavy .it 's made of ; the bed of the table is made of slate so that it can take a lot of abuse , a lot of use , a lot of wear and tear .a home table is normally not going to get near the play that a commercial table gets so the slate or that is. [CLS] [SEP]the bed of the table is normally a little thinner .the weight of the , overall weight of the table is going to be less , so it will do fine for home use .but in in a commercial atmosphere it would not last very long before it would start getting out of level and showing a lot of wear .once again , the quality of your table depends an awful lot on the cost that you put into your table .the more expensive tables have the heavier and thicker slate .so , the biggest thing is you need to determine whether or not you 're going to use it for home use or you 're going to use it for commercial use .home use will be less .commercial use ; the table will cost more .
in this clip we 're going to talk about the proper service procedure to inspect , remove and replace you steel brake lines and bleed the braking system on a ford explorer .in this step we 're going to talk about some of the tools required in order to replace the steel brake lines on a ford explorer .as you can see i have a whole bunch of them here in front of me .i 'm just going to go over them with you .i have my floor jack for jacking the vehicle up off the ground .i have a small hand-held torch here and some oxygen and map gas .i 've got one line wrench .a set of line flaring tools , some unions my standard/metric socket set , magnetic tray , hammer .jack stands , i got a set of them one here one over there .my creeper because i do n't like laying on cold concrete .a couple of zip ties and my replacement lines and hose .those are the tools required in order to service your vehicle 's steel brake lines .
you have on and off buttons , you have a corresponding list of what you want to turn on and off , which controls a module , this is a switch module for the wall .now , we 'll get into the specifics a little later , but basically all it does is , when it gets a signal from the remote the receiver sends a signal to the switch and turns your light on and off or even dims it .now , the main part of this is your receiver , this receives a signal from the remote , goes into the receiver , thru the electrical in your house wiring to the lamp module or wall switch module and turns it on and off .that 's right , the signal first travels thru the air from this remote to the receiver once it gets into the receiver the signal travels thru your house wiring , all over your house , so where ever one of these sits you can have this plugged into your wiring anywhere in the house in about 30 feet away from the remote and it will work , so you can have these modules all over the house controlling lights , appliances , spas , saunas , whatever you want to turn on and off the extend system will do it .now , where can you get this system , just about any hardware store , well any descent hardware store or you can order it from the web , personally i went to ... [CLS] [SEP].an got my system. [CLS] [SEP], so let me show you what this is going to go like , but first you have to wait until the next clip .
so again standing back to back , we are going to separate our feet about the length of one of her legs .we are going to turn back 45 degrees and our front foot is pointing forward .we are going to inhale and the tall person is going to bring their hands and their palm is down and the short person is going to bring their hand. [CLS] [SEP]so their palm is facing up .we are going to inhale left into our fingers and exhale ; this time we are going to drop up the front hand down , we 're gon na bring the backbone all the way around and let a little disco move , drop our hand towards our feet and smile at your partner .good .the back arms are going to come between your body. [CLS] [SEP]and it is going to swing all the way around to the other side .again , smile at your partner and inhale drop that arm through through , bring your arm around and come back to starting position .we come out of the pose just set your feet together and drop your arms .
something i 've mentioned in past clips is that a lot of even numbered tricks involve crossing throws , much like you would throw in a cascade .so , what i 'm going to teach you now is basically a crossing pattern with four balls .this is essentially a five-ball pattern with a hole where the five ball would be .so obviously it 's much more easier to do because you 're only dealing with four objects and you can kind of cheat a little bit on the timing to learn .the site swap notation is 5 , 5 , 5 , 5 , 0.it looks like this .from an asynchronous turn , throw all four balls in a high cascade pattern .from that you can return directly to four balls .now try to get it down on both sides starting left handed , and then once you can do it a few times on each side , try to switch back and forth .as you can see , my hand ends up empty occasionally where that fifth ball would be .now this is a great drill for learning five balls , but also because you have to work with the cascade style throws , will prepare you for other tricks .
i 've been teaching 3 year olds up to 50 year olds for 20 years , so if there 's one thing i know , i know how to teach walking and turning on a runway .i 'd like to start with stepping up on the runway .you can practice this at home or anywhere that you have a step .so i 'm going to start right here at the side of the ramp. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm just going to show you how important it is to focus into your camera , then to take your right foot and step up onto the ramp .the reason i 'm using the right foot is to block the inner-part of the body , the crotch so-to-speak .it 's really not professional to step up with the outside leg .so anytime you 're facing an audience in any type of performance , especially modeling. [CLS] [SEP], you want to be poised and graceful .it 's so important that you put the outside leg up in front of the audience .what i 'd like to do is make sure that you 've got your toes totally to the side of the ramp or the step because you also do n't want to stand back to where you 're lunging in .that 's not graceful as well. [CLS] [SEP], it over-strides your step .so i 'd like for you just to stand right at the edge of your step , right at the edge of the ramp .take the right foot and bring it gracefully up to the ramp and move up .notice that when i do that i do n't bounce .there 's no bounce in the step .what i want you to do is just gracefully get your toes close to the ramp and step up without a bounce , very graceful , very poised .i can do it backwards as well because that trains my body to stay poised , graceful and smooth without a bounce .notice that all the strength is coming from my knees , the strength is not coming from my back .i 'm not curling my shoulders to add to , and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm not moving my arms with my elbows bent to give me strength to get up .this is the way a lot of people take stairs because it gives their body strength to get up .well i 'm a model. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm already pretty strong , so to prove my strength. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to maintain my posture , pull in my stomach muscles which expands my chest so that it gives me strength by leaving my hands flat to my side , fingertips lightly touching the thighs , and just gracefully put my foot up on the ramp , slowly but surely , gracefully stepping up and down. [CLS] [SEP]so there is no bounce in my step .that 's so important for your first appearance when you 're approaching the ramp .that 's how we approach the ramp gracefully .
your french upstroke is going to sound like this .your full .your downstroke .your american grip with the three strokes are going to sound like this .but keep in mind this is in the center of the drum .you can have the variations of rim-shots , off-center and the rim .we 're starting with the upstroke .lastly , here 's your german grip doing the upstroke , down stroke and the full stroke .again , the most important probably being the down stroke as this is where the drumming comes ahead. [CLS] [SEP]and you get that power and that volume .here 's your upstroke .one more time , we 'll illustrate .you have your traditional grip and you have the three strokes , starting with your upstroke .
something else that you need to keep in mind when you 're working with your horse. [CLS] [SEP]is your horse 's temperament and disposition .if you have a fairly relaxed guy like ice-man , you can take longer to work on different areas as long as they 'll tolerate and they will let you know when they want you to move on and when they 're all done with it .if you have again , a young horse with a short attention span they 're going to be looking around more , they 're going to just not want to stand there for as long as you might like them to .if you have a sort of a flighty , anxious horse like many thoroughbreds can be , you 're going to need to just do everything really slowly , really carefully with them , make sure that you keep one hand on them all the time as you 're moving from area to area .just again , it all boils down to knowing your horse .if you have a bigger horse , a work horse like a belgian or something that you 're wanting to work on , again , they 're going to be pretty laid back in how you approach it. [CLS] [SEP]and they 're probably going to be happy to have you work on them anytime .
so now this is where the real fun begins .is that this is making a test strip .and doing this is very important and again. [CLS] [SEP], it 's back to being , it 's back to being a discipline thing .because a lot of times where i came into the darkroom where i just had a negative off my contact sheet , i just wanted to guesstamite .but guessing is bad .after awhile you see that you waste more paper and you waste more time guessing than if you just do one of these test strips .to do this , i have my timer set at 15 seconds .i have my paper under the easel .and what i do is i use this filter kit box. [CLS] [SEP]and i cover up about , maybe , from a 5 x 7 about 6 inches of the paper. [CLS] [SEP]and i expose .and what i do is i make several exposures while moving the box each time the exposure goes up .like this one would be the first one for 15 seconds .and then i would do it again , moving the box about an inch , and i go from left to right. [CLS] [SEP]and i expose it again .and i do this several times and if you think about it , it makes sense .i never move the paper. [CLS] [SEP]and i never move my timer .i only move the box. [CLS] [SEP]and then i look at what my exposures look like once i pull my print out of the developer .
and , the first part to every bit of the fundamentals starts with base , and the strength at the support of your fundamentals , or your foundation .so , what we 're going to talk about right now is the stance , and the stance is very important on defense .it 's a little bit different than a shot , or something like that .if you 're a shooter , you 're going to be pretty much shoulder width apart , but if you 're a defensive player , you want to be a little bit wider. [CLS] [SEP], you want to have a good , strong base in which you can jump from , in which you can move from , and also you want to try to cover as much ground , as you possibly can .so , the first step is , you want to have your feet a little bit more than shoulder width apart , so you have a good , firm foundation .the second part about the stance is , we 're going to have our butt down , in our stance .you want to have your butt down , and your shoulders or your back straight up .you do n't want to play defense leaning forward , and you do n't want to play it leaning back .you want to be good and have your back straight , so that you can move around , and so that you can work .the other thing is your hands .you want to make sure and have your hands either out , or right here , but. [CLS] [SEP]they 've got to be ready to be used .you know when i look out there , and i see a defender with his hands down , he 's useless to me .he 's got to be able to use his hands .and , the last step , and the last part about having a good stance is , you 've got to be up on your toes .you ca n't be on the balls of your feet , or else you 're not going to be able to move .so , when you get in that stance , you want to be able to kind of bounce around a little bit , up on those toes with a good , wide base , being able to use your hands .and , that 's how you start to become a good defender .
right now we 're going to show you the proper way to measure for a neck measurement on for your shirt .last thing you want is a tight shirt that 's going to make you choke all night .you 're going to be uncomfortable already. [CLS] [SEP]so we want you to be as comfortable as possible .there are three basic shirt types : there are wing-tip collars and there 's the lay down collar , mandarin collar .same thing is in common with all of them though ; they all take the same type of measuring to determine the neck size .so , you do. [CLS] [SEP]that is you go right around the neck above the shirt. [CLS] [SEP]-- there 's actually about three way you can do this -- but pull it tight and then whatever measurement you get add an inch to that .and that 's how i do it most of the time .but there 's another way to do it is you can go around the neck .leave your fingers on the inside of the tape and pull it snug , but you 're going to have a little bit of a gap because of the fingers in there .you really want the shirt to be about an inch bigger than what your neck is so that you 'll be comfortable .the third option would be just to find a dress shirt in the closet that fits nice , usually in the back of the neck will have the size of the shirt and in those cases just write down whatever that shirt size is and that 'll work fine .so , three ways -- all of them should work fine if you take your time and do it right , but leave a little bit of a gap .
when i add compost to my piles , a lot of time , they are really warm .for example , when i 've mulched all the tree branches , it was hot .it was steamy for like three months .at that point , you would never use the mulch .grass clippings and leaves , a lot of times , they compost much quicker and. [CLS] [SEP]when i 'm deciding whether it 's ready or not , the first factor is if it 's warm or not .if it 's heat ...if there 's any heat coming off of it or if you are standing near it. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's warm , then wait ; always give it a couple more months and wait until your compost is really cold .my compost here is almost ready to use .it 's only been here for three or four months on these grass clippings , but if i go underneath , from the very first grass clippings , it is starting to look like soil .it is looking really broken up .it does n't look that much different from the compost that i purchased from the garden center .so , i would n't say it 's quite ready yet , because the pine needles still look like pine needles and the leaves still look like leaves .but , when it 's totally broken down and looks like earth , then that 's a good time to use your mulch .the best thing about mulch and using all of my compost , i can use it as the base of my garden beds and then put the mulch that i purchased from the garden center on top. [CLS] [SEP]and it seems to be a great combination and that way i save a lot of money on the compost that i 've purchased .in the next segment , we 'll talk about how to mulch with compost .

today we are going to be drawing and we need to figure out what we are going to draw .like any writer usually will choose something. [CLS] [SEP]he or. [CLS] [SEP]she wants to write about , we need to be the same way when it comes to what we are going to draw .it 's got to be something that we are passionate or excited about because if not , we are going to lose interest quickly and abandon our attempts to drawing something .if i go back in my memory far back and think of some the earliest things i started drawing , i think of animals .i think of family pets and i also think of automobiles because i 've always been interested in them .so it is important to focus on something that you want to draw and then we need to consider where we are going to be drawing and where we are going to set up .for instance if you were doing a landscape drawing which we are not today , you would want to be outside and the same goes for natural type drawings in the field if you will with wild animals or. [CLS] [SEP]maybe the domestic cat that just from the right prospective kind of looks like a wild tiger .another little trick is maybe work from a photograph or photographs .the same can be applied to both figure studies , humans if you do n't necessarily have convenient model like your mom around or a sibling or automobiles something that i have also drawn since i was little .you do n't necessarily have to have ecstatic example on your driveway or parked on the street .a lot of this stuff can come from you guessed it , right up here .but it is important again to remember that you should draw something that interests you and that could come from your travels , come from just day in and day out activities , driving in town , looking up at architecture , driving on the freeways and noticing other cars .so find your subject , lay out your area and let 's get ready to begin .
hi there , this is melody mooney , and. [CLS] [SEP]today i 'm giving you some tips on how to fold your clothes .we 're going to be working with a t-shirt and folding that today .but first things first , i want you to go ahead and get yourself a flat surface .i always fold on a kitchen table , but you could fold on your bed or on the floor as long as it 's flat .alright , so what i 've done is i 've gone ahead. [CLS] [SEP]and i 've made myself a 1x1 piece of cardboard. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to use that to fold in just a minute .then i go ahead. [CLS] [SEP]and i get my t-shirt. [CLS] [SEP], i kind of shake it out , make sure there 's nothing in there , and what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to take the front and put it face down in my folding area .and this is a big t-shirt , it 's one of my husband 's .i 'm putting the sleeves out to the side. [CLS] [SEP], just make sure it 's neat , now take your 1x1 piece of cardboard and put it right in the center of the shoulders of the t-shirt .alright , next i 'm going to take the sleeve of the left , on the left here , and fold it right into the center .there we go .and fold it just a bit back towards the shoulder .so there i have a nice fold going down .let me show you that again on the right hand side .what i want to do , take the right hand sleeve and the bottom and fold it into the cardboard and fold it back towards the shoulder .there you go , you have it .so , next thing i 'm going to do. [CLS] [SEP], make sure it 's all smooth , is i 'm going to bring this fold up to the bottom of this cardboard. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm making a nice line .now , the magic part is , i 'm going to slide the cardboard out of the top , there we go , and one more fold left .here we go , taking the bottom , folding it up to the shoulders .and look at that , look how nice and neat that is , you can even see what t-shirt it is .it 's a good way if you 're traveling or if you 're storing things , you can actually get more t-shirts in your drawer than if you just throw them in .and that is how we fold a t-shirt !
okay , now that we 've got the gate hung on the hinges , we 're going to move on to the latch side .first item that we 're going to mount is the striker .here it is placed about chest height , which is just a matter of preference .if you do n't want kids to be able to open it , you can put it higher , or you can put it lower if you want them to be able to access it .make sure you get all your screws in nice and tight .and then grab the latch portion , and have one person hold it in place , with the gate in the close position , and line the striker up perfectly in the center , so the gate will be able to open and close freely , without binding on the latch .once you get the first two screws in , you can open your gate , and finish putting the rest of the screws in on the inside .
ok so you just got your iphone , or you actually just want to change some things around whether you have your phone unlocked. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to go to tmobile. [CLS] [SEP]or you 're going to be using another sim card than the one it came with .changing the sim cards is a little bit of a pain in the butt , but not the most imposible thing to do .of course the one thing you want to do is make sure that your iphone is off .what i find is the easiest is using a thumbtack , just like this one here .there is actually a little hole in the top of your iphone , right here that you 'll go ahead and press in and it will slide out just like that .this is a great way to take this out , because doing it with a paperclip and other things like that becomes a real pain in the butt .so here is your sim card , and we 'll go ahead and push it out just to show you .get it out of there .so here 's your sim card , here 's your sim card holder and of course here is your iphone with the sim card part exposed .so once you 're done , whether you 've changed your card or you 're going to put another card in , whatever it is , we 'll just go ahead and find the spot .make sure the hole is aligned with the hole right here on your iphone .lock it in place .it snaps back in , makes a flush little piece right there , and it 's all done .so once you 're done you can turn it back on or do whatever else you have to do with your iphone .that 's pretty much the easiest way to change your sim card .just go ahead and use the thumbtack .i find it the best way .
in this clip , we 're going to take the single paradiddle and apply it to the drum set setting .okay ?and how it can help you in your drum set playing .it is a very efficient tool if you will that rudiment .some rudiments do n't really apply to the drum set setting or ca n't be applied to that setting as easily or as beneficial to your playing as the paradiddle .so let 's go ahead and take a look as to make the paradiddle work in the drum set setting to make you a better player .so , what we 're going to do is take a look at the basic drum beat with the basic drum fill , how you would alternate sticking or just regular .let 's take a look real quick .one , two , three and four and a one .so that would be a drum fill and a one we just hit. [CLS] [SEP]would actually be the start of the next bar .now note , my left hand is over the floor tom and my right hand is over the cymbal that we just hit on beat one .if you notice my shoulders , the center of my body , i 'm kind of leaning over more towards the floor tom , i 've got to make it all the way back here for beat and of one on the high hat , and two .so your moving your whole body and you 've got to do this .now if we put the paradiddle in there , watch what happens to the drum fill and how more efficient your body movement is and your not wasting any movement .so let 's take a look with the paradiddle fill .same fill , we 're just putting the paradiddle in .one , two , three and paradiddle , four , and one .so now as you can see my body and the center of body , my core , is still in place .i did n't have to move it. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm back here on one with my left hand which needs to be back here on the snare on two for the drum beat. [CLS] [SEP]and all i have to do is move the right hand over which i 'm doing as i hit one on the cymbal with my left hand .that is why a paradiddle is important in your drum set setting .it helps you become more efficient. [CLS] [SEP]so you ?re not wasting a lot of movement and which is helping you be on time more which is the purpose of being a drummer .let 's take a look at our next step .
you 'll notice my look is up where the ipu is , so .okay , one , two , fourth part , uehi .so from hela , uehi .
welcome .today i 'm going to teach you how to iron like an expert .i 'm going to show you how to set up your area .i 'm going to show you what to do with certain clothes .i 'm going to show your some neat tricks , some advanced tricks that you might not already know .some you might know , but a way to do it. [CLS] [SEP]that 's a little bit more fun .and i 'm going to teach you a little bit more about what to do with your clothes once that they 're all ironed .we 're talking about everything to do with ironing .not only just the ironing itself , but your clothes and some of the upkeep of your clothes .why do we iron ?well we iron to make things clean .we iron to make things flat and nice and neat .trust me though .all of these steps that we 've taken up to this point will help you save time in the long run , i promise .and also if you 're kind of you know bored by doing ironing , if it does n't excite you as much as it excites me , you can flip on the tv .start watching your soaps or whatever .so stick around. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to teach you how to iron like an expert .
preparing things for reproduction is our subject .so remember i told you that i do an eight and a half by eleven every week day .well one day i decided that i wanted to write the word amazing because at that point in time i was feeling like everything was amazing .so i went ahead. [CLS] [SEP]and i calligraphed this word amazing and in the process of calligraphing it. [CLS] [SEP]i was making a bunch of mistakes. [CLS] [SEP]and so i wound up using what i would consider to be an awful lot of whiteout .there 's whiteout here and here and here. [CLS] [SEP], i was crisping up you know crisping up and doing all kinds of things .i did n't actually do a lot of tracing here .but in any event this is , this is the amazing that i wound up with .and then i decided that i was going to do this in reverse. [CLS] [SEP]and i do n't have equipment here that reverses things going from black letters on white ground to white letters on black ground. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's a very classic things for calligraphers to do .and you got to do it. [CLS] [SEP]you know put tech , modern technology , photo mechanics or whatever. [CLS] [SEP]and so i went to my printer. [CLS] [SEP]and i had him reverse it for me .so that 's the , you know working with magic machines .
so i wanted to talk a little about health care with your dog .some things you can do at home .one of the things that is really helpful with the dog is , if he 'll let you , brush his teeth .you can see , he still has a lot of puppy teeth here .they 're really sharp , sharp puppy teeth .but now would be a good time , see how nice and easy your dog. [CLS] [SEP]let 's me touch his teeth and everything ?would be a good time to teach him how to brush his teeth , to train him when he 's young like this to brush his teeth .because then you 're going to have clean teeth. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're not going to have a bad breath .and it also , later on , your puppy may not need to have to have an anesthetic to clean his teeth .and so , it 's really nice if you just kind of take your time now and make it like a daily ritual and make it fun for him .and when you get a toothbrush the first thing you want to do is not just start brushing the teeth , but just let him get used to it .so it 'll take about a month for him to understand what `` brush your teeth ''means .and then , the other thing is there are some special toothbrushes , but it 's very important that you get special toothpaste .the toothpaste that we use is stuff that has no detergent in it , because a puppy does n't know he 's supposed to spit it out .and so , again , we have it in different flavors so that they like the taste of it. [CLS] [SEP]and it makes your job a little bit easier to train your puppy , how to take care of his teeth .another thing that i think is pretty important and stuff that you can do at home , is puppies have a lot of problems with their ears and you can take a little kleenex , maybe a little mineral oil , and again , see how nice your puppy is , because i think you 've already been working on this because he lets you mess with him .a lot of dogs do n't like to be messed with this way .but you can see there 's a little bit of wax down in here .the ear canal goes deep down into the ear and what you want to do with that is just kind of clean the areas that you can see .if you leave the wax alone in there , he 'll wind up , a place for bacteria to grow and predispose your puppy to have ear infections .the other thing that you should be doing is to handle their feet .and you can see their nails .it looks like you 've already trimmed them a little bit , but if you 've handle their feet a lot like this , when he does go to the veterinarian or the groomer and have his nails trimmed , he 's not going to be all worried about somebody messing with his feet .i can see you 've done that .most puppies wo n't let you do that .when you trim his nails , you can see right here. [CLS] [SEP]and you can take off about this much each time .and you have to be careful because there 's a nerve supply and a blood supply that comes down .if you cut it back , even this far , you could make it bleed and it would hurt him .so , if they get hurt with one nail trim when they 're young , then they never want anybody touching their feet again .
i 'm here at everything peaceful in wilmington , north carolina .i 'm here to discuss what is transverse friction massage .transverse means to go across and friction means to just apply pressure to the muscle underneath the skin .so transverse friction massage is basically moving the skin with your fingers transversally over muscle fibers or across the muscle fibers .and basically the point of doing that is to break up any adhesions or muscle knots in the tissue , increase circulation and therefore , increase flexibility of that muscle .and any time that you bring circulation to a muscle , you 're going to decrease the problems that it has as far as pain and discomfort ; things like that .so basically to perform transverse friction massage , you bring the joint into full range , in to full stretch .and then take your fingers and just move across those muscle fibers .and that 's transverse friction massage .
now we 're getting into stuff that 's closer to you .so the closer it is the darker and the more dense what you 're going to be able to see because the reason why this stuff looks so soft in the background is because you 've got the atmosphere. [CLS] [SEP]and you 've got haze and dust. [CLS] [SEP]that 's softening the edges .that 's what makes it look like it 's off in the distance. [CLS] [SEP]and then as it gets closer , it starts changing color. [CLS] [SEP]and i can go on and on and on about it , but now we 're just going to take the black .we 're going to make. [CLS] [SEP]a couple cactus 's that look like they 're bigger and closer to you , actually this is purple .let me get the black .and then just make the bottom look black .and do n't be afraid .there 's no rules .you do n't know what cactus 's , floral cactus 's they grow everywhere , and that 's just basically lines is all that is , and then you can take and use your rat tails at the bottom to make it look like there 's not a lot of grass , but you can make it look like there 's shrubs , the cracks , make it look like there 's shrubs around there and. [CLS] [SEP]more dead grass and weeds and whatever , and you pretty much. [CLS] [SEP]that 's what you have for a foreground. [CLS] [SEP]is just remember everything is closer to you .
hello welcome back. [CLS] [SEP]we got some more fermented foods .i kind of a little surrounded right here by a few of the things we 've made including this ziziki that was a little nice demonstration for you .but what i really want to tell you. [CLS] [SEP]is that it helps with the digestive issues .people that have food allergies or digestive problems such as gurd or chrones really these fermented foods are their friends .stick to this puzzle whole natural food and you 're going to help your digestion so much more .a lot of these people spent years messing up. [CLS] [SEP]and i have to you know before i be came a nutritionist spent years messing up your digestion because in america we do n't actually even deal with that .it 's all about faster quicker better food that we can just ingest get out there. [CLS] [SEP]get moving , get shaken , and make the money .but in other societies and definitely other cultures this is where they place their emphasis on .sitting down relaxing eating food that is healthy and nutritious as well as easily digestible .adding these fermented foods to help them heal their digestion and to digest all together .so it 's good for you too .
every monologue or song , you want to show a journey .this is how you can really show that you 're an actress who could n't pull off an entire play .i mean , acting is about a journey .it 's about just watching a character go from one moment to another .so , in `` shy '' from `` once upon a mattress , '' for example , my journey is that i start out really shy and neurotic , but. [CLS] [SEP]then i reassure my partner , `` it 's okay .i 'm still lovable , ''but in the end , i 'm still really nervous , but. [CLS] [SEP]there 's a kind of transformation in that .i 've kind of , come to accept my shyness in the end .and i 'll show you what i mean : `` actually , because i 'm actually , terribly timid .i mean , i just feel terrible about this , and i 'm ugly !i feel horrible about it. [CLS] [SEP]but i kind of accept it , horribly shy . [CLS] [SEP]''
an essential piece of equipment in sharpening your turning tools is going to be a bench grinder .this is a two speed grinder .it operates at a slow speed and a high speed , but i almost exclusively will operate this bench grinder at the lower speed which is about seventeen hundred fifty rpms .it has two wheels and they 're eight inch wheels .this is a sixty grit wheel and i use this wheel if i have to do any reshaping of my tools , and this is an eighty grit wheel and this is a wheel that i will use when i need to just put a fresh edge , or fresh cutting edge , on my tool .it comes with some after market pieces of equipment that are underneath , mounted underneath the wheels , and they 're made , they 're called the wolverine jigs .the wolverine jig are these two sections that are mounted right beneath the two grinding wheels , and on one side we have a flat tool rest that slides in and out , and under this one a v-arm that slides in and out .
i 'm a dental assistant with solutionz. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to show you on how to floss your teeth .pretty much if you take a look over here , it 's pretty easy .what you want to do is you want to rip off a piece of floss .once when you ripped off a piece of floss that 's a foot long , the more floss that you have the better because therefore , it 's easier for you to work with .then you 're just going to go ahead and wind it around your fingers , you can even wind it around your pointer fingers or middle finger ; i like to use my middle finger , it 's a lot easier to work with 'cause then you can use your pointer fingers to manipulate the floss .so , what you 're going to do is you 're just going to floss , put the floss in between the teeth. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to do what we call. [CLS] [SEP]is you 're going to create like a c motion .you 're going to push the floss down , you 're going to curve it over like a c. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 're just going to move it back and forth , like such , push the floss down , curve it over to a c motion and just move it back and forth .so therefore you 're jiggling any debris that might be in between your teeth and then pull the floss through .you 're going to do that on each individual tooth , create a c motion and then just basically , jiggle back and forth. [CLS] [SEP]and then re-free that tooth free of debris .you 're going to do that in between all of your teeth. [CLS] [SEP]and then when you 're done , you always want to make sure that you brush your teeth. [CLS] [SEP]so therefore you can make sure you take the debris off that might be on the front part of your teeth .and once again my name is michelle , i 'm a dental assistant with solutionz. [CLS] [SEP]and i just showed you on how you can floss your teeth .
it 's energetic and it 's fast paced .i like to use bunny when the energy in the room is getting bogged down .when people seem to be getting shy or self conscious .we play bunny .and people start giggling and feeling really silly .and things can get rolling .so i would n't do this with a bunch of complete strangers .but with a group of people who have a little bit knowledge of each other .and need a little energy boost .and here is , how it works .we 'll be in a circle , in a room .and one person is going to start .and they 're going to be the bunny .and they go like this .now i never decided , is this bunny whiskers or is it bunny teeth .that 's up to you .that 's a thing , you can decide .they 're going to go like this .bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny .there 's going to be someone on their left .that person is going to be their bunny ears , on this side .and they 're going to be going , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny .the other person on their right , who is the other side 's bunny ears .and they 're going to be going , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny .so you can imagine , there 's three people here all going , bunny ,bunny .yeah , there 's this bunny , bunny .and this bunny , bunny .and so every one is going , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny .and the person in the center , when they 're ready .they throw the bunny to someone across the circle .and that person becomes the bunny .and the people on either side of them , become the bunny ears .so it 's this real , fast pace , silly thing .so it 's really hard to demonstrate by myself .but i 'm going to do a little try at this .and i 'm going to look , especially silly .bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny .bunny .and if that was me .bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny .bunny .like that and so on and so forth .that is the basic structure of bunny .it is just fast and silly and fun .it 's important to go fast or else. [CLS] [SEP]it feels kind of weird .another variation on that is morphing bunny .so if i was the bunny in the center here .and two people were my ears .and i went like this , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny .and i moved from having whiskers to an ear .suddenly , this person on my right , is now the bunny .they 're going , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny .and this person over here , has to join in , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny , like .so it morphs , the left or the right .so you can throw it across the circle .you can morph to the left or the right .and that 's advanced bunny and would n't try that , right away .but you can add it , once the group gets a hang of it .so that 's a fun .silly warm up called bunny .
how do i use the ba kua .as i mentioned before the eight sections of the ba kua related to every part of your life .so you have to learn the ba kua very well. [CLS] [SEP]if you can remember by heart .or i have one like the small version of the ba kua which is portable .you can carry it with you when you are going around the house .then you can see which part of the house is related with which position of the ba kua .then you can feng shui that section to get what you want .it 's easily to find this ba kua in the books , or you can make it up yourself .
some of the common mistakes you may experience while learning how to do a switch pivot grind will basically be that now you 're traveling up the ramp and. [CLS] [SEP]before you get there you 're building a little bit of a curve before you hit the coping and this gets you the momentum to get the grind going .so a lot of the problems are going to occur approaching the ramp or coping in the correct way and making sure that you have control of it because once you get into the grind position it may shoot out on you .so what you 're going to want to do is learn this trick with smaller grinds first meaning. [CLS] [SEP]just head up the ramp at a small degree , do a short grind and come in .the more used to get to the positioning and the grind feeling the better you 'll be when it comes time to get a long locked switch pivot and come in .so another problem you may experience while learning how to do these switch pivot grinds is you may find that different coping is going to be a lot faster than others .some coping as soon as you hit it it 's going to be very fast .some coping when you hit it. [CLS] [SEP]it 's going to be slow. [CLS] [SEP]and you 'll have to push it .the only way to do , to feel comfortable doing this , is to practice as much as possible on the obstacle that you 're skating and make sure that your speed and your approach , the angle that you 're needed , is the right one for the coping that you are skating on .you do n't want to make too much of a turn if your coping is really fast .you 'll need less of a turn to get into slick coping , and for coping that sticks you 'll need to give yourself more of a degree of an angle to get into it to force it across and to grind it .these are just some of the common mistakes with a switch pivot grind .
you know one thing that 's going to make your game look really cool , and spectacular is a 360 dunk .it 's not something that you 're probably going to need during the game , but it 's something that can take your game to the next level , and if you 're really looking for exposure , to make it to the nba , or to college , this is something that can really do it .hi , i 'm travis , and this is how you do that 360 dunk .what you want to do during 360 dunk is , it 's a little different than a regular dunk because when you 're doing a 360 dunk , you want to make sure that you turn your body once you get in the air .so , you step first. [CLS] [SEP]-- that 's the same thing as any other dunk .you step first , and then you take off .and once you take off and raise that right foot , or if you 're coming from the left side , step with the right and raise that left foot , you want to make sure that you spin , and keep in your mind exactly where that rim is , because you 're not going to be able -- you 're going to for a split second. [CLS] [SEP], you 're not going to see the rim .so , you take off , and you 're in the air .you make sure you spin your body .turn your torso and the rest of your body will come .turn your torso , the rest of your body will follow , and then make sure you get the ball high enough -- spot the rim , you want to spot the rim .it 's just like dancing .you want to spot it .you spot it on the way up , spin , spot it on the way when you come back around , and once you spot that rim , put the ball over and dunk it through .there you have it , 360 dunking .
now let 's take a moment to just bring our thoughts inward. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to focus for a moment on the meditation and mindfulness in our daily lives .so let 's go ahead and find a comfortable position .we can lay on the floor , sitting up tall and leaning against a wall and let 's go ahead and close our eyes bringing our thoughts inward .now let 's think about how we 've gone through our day today and how we have chosen to eat our meals today .have we been grabbing something on the run , have we taken the time to sit down and eat with friends or family ?let 's picture ourselves at one of our meals today , sitting down with a plate of food in front of our face , down on the table and let 's think about every color on that plate , every morsel of food , seeing it all on our plate , taking it all in and as we begin to eat our meal taking small forkfuls of food , small spoonfuls , bring that food to our mouths and savoring the flavors , enjoying the intricacies of the tastes in our mouths and going through our entire meal in that way , taking several minutes in our minds to go through that meal , slowly focusing on every smell , every sight and every taste .and let 's commit to ourselves now to use that mindfulness when we are eating all of our meals all the time. [CLS] [SEP]and we will enjoy our food so much more .
in this clip we 're going to be learning how to do finger spins .a finger spin is , here , when you put it on your finger and spin it over once .okay ?now , the most important part is , finding the balance of your kama .once you find the balance you 're going to have to be able to find it quickly , just stick your finger there , without messing up .so , you 're going to take your finger and put it right above that balancing point. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to throw it .you 're going to throw it , pull it towards you , it 's going to rotate around. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to catch that balancing point .put it in your hand. [CLS] [SEP], like this , hold it , you 're going to throw , flip it around , roll your finger with it all the way back into your hand .so , one more time from here , spin and catch .there you go , and that 's going to be your finger spin .now , when you get it down , go ahead and try and do two spins .so , you 're going to take your finger , put it about , way up here. [CLS] [SEP], two finger links above .so , you 're going to roll it , and then roll it around again , all the way to a catch .so , from here , two spins .there you go .one more time .okay , sometimes it might come off your finger ,naturally just rotate , just go in and catch it and play it off .but , if you ca n't keep your finger on it the whole time , you 're going to be moving your hand in this motion of spinning towards you .so , get those finger spins down , get real comfortable with it , make sure you can find the weight of your kama. [CLS] [SEP]so you can do some really cool spins. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's really going to add to your form , doing chops , spins , spin it back , spin it once over .alright ?or double it up , add two spins .
m going to show you how to make a cute little bag out of regular everyday fabrics .in this next step we 're going to sew together our bag .the outside of our bag .so you can see that i left it exactly how it was on the cutting table .i have the right sides pinned together and i have a half an inch seam allowance .and i like to use just a regular old simple stitch .if you have a good machine and you do n't really need to do an exaggerated heavy stitch you can just use a simple stitch .also the fact that we have a lining means that it 's ok for not using a big crazy stitch on the outside because we have a lining .so everything that goes in the bag is going to be in the lining .it 's going to take some weight off of the outside of the bag. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to have fewer holes and less worries .so we 're going to go ahead and start sewing .whenever you sew the very first few stitches , you 're going to sew forward. [CLS] [SEP]and then you 're going to press a button right here .it should be a button .sometimes you twist a knob on the side ; it depends on your sewing machine .but usually you 'll have a button right here .you 're going to press it .you 're going to sew backwards a little bit .and that 's just going to secure your seam .and make sure to remove your pins as you go .when you get to any corner , you want to go backwards and forwards a little bit because corners take all heat , all the weight .and what you want to do is whenever you are getting to a corner , instead of lifting up and moving everything around. [CLS] [SEP], you just want to lift up and twist so that you stay , so that you get a perfect edge .you want to make sure you 're on the line and that you get a perfect edge .ok .
for another edged weapon attack or defense from a straight stab we 're going to go to the inside now .and we 're going to look at another disarm .we 're going to use the same principle .off line as always .this time i 'm going to attack the inside of the forearm .it 's where i naturally am .and i 'm also going to attack the wrist as well .it 'll be simultaneous .obviously it 's pretty physically complicated to a degree .but i want to keep the motions nice , short and sweet and to the point .my goal is to strike this here .cause stretching of the tissue and then cut down to the wrist and as i do that i 'll begin to get a nice bend in the wrist .so as daniel comes in .boom .start to stretch it out .hold on to it .we 'll do it nice and slow .here , just like this .now , as he comes in .by striking here. [CLS] [SEP]i stretch the hand out .he 'll still have a little bit of control here and by striking into the wrist i get a natural flexation of the wrist which causes the fingers to stretch out which allows the knife to fly away .so once again as daniel comes in i 'm striking into the forearm , down into the arm , down into the wrist , hand comes up , the knife comes out .and that 's a nice inside parrying striking technique for a straight stab .
what we need to do now is dig the hole for gardenias .take into consideration the size .this is particular one gallon so we are going to dig that size plus at least one more inch .when you grow around it , let it be between 1/2 inch to inch .okay now let 's start digging now .well we are lucky today .this soil is so loose , it 's moist just like we need it. [CLS] [SEP]and it is going to be perfect for our gardenia .one more , there we go .we are going to check to see the hole is what we need ; the appropriate size .what we are going to do is we have our gardenia , pull it up gently .perfect .it is right above the ground level here .we have about 2 inches around it which is going to be fine because we need the roots to grow fast .this is great .we still have 3 more holes to go to .let 's attack them. [CLS] [SEP]and this is how we prepare the holes for gardenias .
the first step to becoming a web designer is to sign up for a host .they 're going to give you a little bit of space on the internet that you can choose to upload your files and maybe even a website name .let 's go to the computer , after you have your host , and i 'm going to show you how to create some web documents .let 's click on the start button , and we 're just going to launch word by going to all programs , microsoft office , and word .i 'm going to type a little bit of a text in here , and let 's do some formatting on that such as bolding it .let 's do a little more formatting , i 'm going to center this text .you would create your webpage in word with all the information that you wanted to include on it .once you 're done with your webpage , look at the little bar up here , the office button , we 're going to go to save as , and on save as type , we want to do is as a webpage .i 'm going to put this page on my desktop. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm just going to call it my page .now that you have your page created let 's get it on the internet .what i 'm going to do is connect to my host. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to use information that your host would have given you to access your website .we 're going to do so by ftp , by clicking on the start bar , opening up computer , and just at the very top here , type ftp and your website .once again , you 're going to need a user name and a password that would be given to you by your web host .these are the files that comprise my website .i 'm just going to upload my page , and as you can see , it has been added to my site as my page dot htm .now let 's pull that up in the web browser .you go to your site. [CLS] [SEP]and then the name of the file that you just uploaded .there is my webpage that i just created in word .my name is dave andrews , and i just showed you how to become a web designer .
today we 're going to learn a couple old school tricks .now the term old school just refers to tricked that were originated in the mid to late 80 's , early 90 's , usually have a lot of flair , just real smooth surfer kind of style influence , cruising tricks .one of the first tricks that was originated in the streets and on ramps is something called a power slide .you have a front side power slide when you 're actually facing the direction that you 're sliding and you 'll slide with your wheels in a direction like this .it 's just being light on the toes and back in the day they had soft wheels , and just power slide and make a lot of noise , have a lot of fun .you can , you know , put your hand down and make it a little more stylish , whatever you prefer .then you have the back side power slide .back side power slide is when you 're sliding , your back is facing the direction that you 're going , once again , you 're just sliding your wheels along the ramp light on your feet , just kind of putting your own style on the trick .another old school trick would be the bean plant , and the bean plant , you 're just going to cruise up to any surface , it could be a sidewalk , it could be an embankment , it could be flat ground , you 're then going to take one foot off , one foot on , and do a hop , and land back on your board , grabbing the board right in the center .i 'll now demonstrate how to do a front side power slide , back side power slide , and a bean plant .and that 's how to do old school tricks .
now we 've played one octave scale .one octave e major scale .but there are plenty of other octaves .okay !let me show you .here is the first octave that we 've played .now to continue our adventure .all we have to do is keep playing .just go up the scale for the next octave .shift !
so , now grace and i have shown you a multitude of exercises that you can do with your partner .now , we 're going to show you some stretches that you can do with your partner .it 's always very important to stretch after any exercise routine that you do .the benefits of stretching with a partner , is the partner will actually help you go a little further than you can do otherwise by yourself .so , grace and i are doing a back to back stretch with our legs crossed .and , this is really going to stretch our back. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's also going to stretch our groin area .so , what we 're going to do is grace is going to lean back on me. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to stretch forward .and , with her weight on my back. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm actually going to stretch farther than i would otherwise .and , then we 're going to switch. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'm going to put my weight on grace and push her a little further than she would go .so , this stretch goes like this .ok.lean back on me .and , switch .you want to hold this stretch at least twelve seconds .switch .always remember to breathe when you 're stretching to get more oxygen to the muscles that you 're stretching .so , this stretch can be very relaxing for both parties .and , you 'll definitely get the benefits of flexibility by doing this stretch .
okay. [CLS] [SEP]the drink we are about to make is called caribbean punch .first thing we 'll do is put ice in a glass and measure out one shot of our banana liquor .find that real quick , here we go .and , also , one shot of dark rum .here we go .and , some lime juice .about a teaspoon of lime juice .next we 're going to add pineapple juice and orange juice .there 's orange juice and pineapple juice .equal parts of both .and we 'll mix this up real good .and there we are .bring it up high .it 's going to be a nice beach side drink to enjoy in the caribbean or in the confines of your own home .set up the glass , give it a pour , and the last thing we 're going to do is sprinkle a little bit of nutmeg on top .oh !that 's a little bit more than a little bit .give it a straw and bottoms up !
we 've learned how to construct and play an a tonic minor arpeggio on the violin , but now let 's take a look at it on staff paper .this is our treble clef .now this is our first scale degree which is a , so we put a 1 under it .the second is c natural .c. [CLS] [SEP]natural , usually in an a major scale which is where this a tonic minor arpeggio is derived from , has three sharps .one of them is c sharp .now , we 'll natural it .we have to put that accidental next to it .third is. [CLS] [SEP]e. [CLS] [SEP]a has a 4 and also has a 0 over it .that 's for an open string .remember , we were talking about playing it with an open string .that 's what the symbol is , a zero .five , c natural .e open , the seventh has a third degree , third finger over it because it 's played with your third finger .the eighth has a first , nine has a 3 , and ten has a fourth finger .
one of the tools that i use , and you 'll use a lot is a hand spreader .now , you definitely do n't want get out the great big spreader to put out some seed or to put a little bit of fertilizer in an area where something ?s starting to look yellow .if you 've got something like this , it usually has a little handle and you 're going to apply it .it evenly applies it , and it 's easy to work with .it only holds about five pounds .five pounds is easy to handle .if you start working with something that handles hundreds of pounds , you better have your tractor or you better eat your wheaties to help get it across that area .if you 've got a small area , the little hand spreader is a tool that you 'll use on a regular basis. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]always amazed that i use it more than i think i 'm going to .so , you ought to have one of these in your garage because it 's going to help make those little projects of putting that rye grass seed out in the fall or if you 're putting fertilizer over. [CLS] [SEP]and you just want a light covering. [CLS] [SEP], the hand spreader helps make it easy. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's something that you 're going to use again and again .so , you can apply a number of materials with it : pesticides , some of the organic base materials , you can use with your hand spreader also .for on gardening , i 'm stan defreitas , `` mr. [CLS] [SEP]green thumb '' .
ok , our next step is going to be to label all the parts of the chair .this is an extremely important part of this process because if you do n't label them , later when the chair is in pieces , you 're going to get confused about what goes where .as you can see , all these spindles look alike , but they 're not alike in the way they join into the parts of the chair .so each spindle has to go back where it was to begin with .what we do is take a roll of masking tape and write on it .as you can see , this chair is already labeled .write on the tape right front , left front , these are the front legs .these spindles are labeled front one and front two going from top to bottom and all labeling is going to be done as you stand in front of the chair and look at it .now what i like to do is put my labels to the right side so that now i know this spindle is the front spindle on top. [CLS] [SEP]and this is on the right side .
okay .now we are going to start marking .with the fingers , with -- you can mark like this because as you 've seen in the pictures , those feathers , they are long .the feathers that are there in the end of the neck and they start in the chest and in the back .they are long feathers .then , do these kind of long strokes like this. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to make more or less the effect of the feathers. [CLS] [SEP]but it always has to be in the direction that they show in here .and just -- a last touch up here in order to make the things even from the back , from the front .take that crumbs of clay away .man : do you want to hold up the picture ?jorge benlloch :and then , hey , we have an eagle .now , we have to transform this one in about one -- and we are going to paint it in white. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'll put some little colors on it .i think you will enjoy it .
how often you should replace your furniture .i believe on couches , on sofas , you should replace your furniture every three to four years .the reason why , is because of foam .the foam on the inside of the couches starts wearing down again , because you 're sitting down all the time , so i believe that every three to four years you should go ahead and change your couch , and it will have that nice fresh feel so that you can have that comfort back in your seat , basically in your seat .okay , that also should go for your mattress .about every five years you should change your mattress .that 's another unit. [CLS] [SEP]also that should be changed a lot .people are letting it go a little to far .change it because , again a good nights sleep is a good night .you 'll have a great day the next day , that 's also one of the others things , but again .the most important thing is , upgrade your furniture number one , is when it 's not good to have , you do n't have a good feeling .number two when you want to change your life around , when you want to change the style , when you want to have a new look .change your furniture also , it 's very important .people 's attitudes and people 's lives change when they upgrade their furniture or change their furniture .the color , the design , the look .so those are very important things right there , but again , whenever you feel that it 's appropriate for you go ahead and do that .
hi there , and welcome to the wonderful world of washing clothes .we have been talking about washing your colored clothes , gone through some steps about sorting , about pre-treating , about prioritizing , everything to keep your colors looking great .after you 've done washing , the next step , the logical step , is going to be drying .but there 's a couple things i need you to do before you go on to drying .first is inspect your clothes .what are you looking for ?you are looking for stains .you really do n't want to move on to drying with a stain in your clothes .it 's very important to check front and back and get those stains out while they are still damp .you do n't want your beautiful colored shirts to be ruined by stains .also look for bleeding .we have taken every precaution for that not to happen , but sometimes it just happens .again , you want to catch it while it 's still damp .you do n't want to get it into that dry mode .so go through everything , take a lot of care with your colors .it 's important to look at your clothes while you take them out of the washer .just give them a good looking over .this will help preserve your clothes and that 's what we 're all about .we 're helping to keep your clothes , and especially your colors , bright .
hi , i 'm terri , and in this segment we 're going to be doing how to twist hair .now there 's many different styles you can do for twisting hair .now with the type of hair that angela has , i 've done a few small twists here , but i think what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to show how to do a large roll twist .so , we 're going to start at the top , and we 're going to take small ...a small segment like this .and we 're just going to roll it in , twist it in .and do it fairly tight so that it does n't get too loose and start to fall out .and then what we 're going to do is we 're going to slowly add pieces , and roll them in , or twist them in .and keep taking , and twisting them in .all right .and then once you get down to the nape of the neck. [CLS] [SEP]and there 's no more hair to roll on the one side. [CLS] [SEP], you can just go ahead and clip it so it does n't unroll .go ahead , do the other side .and this would be the finished product of a twist roll from the back , and what it would look like from the front .
i would like to explain how to shape eyebrows .this is a very important procedure and i am going to just clip the hair on the top and also the best way to shape eyebrows you have to use tweezers .just apply the tweezer and hold the skin up like this and remove it. [CLS] [SEP]and you can shape it perfectly wonderful. [CLS] [SEP]and this is the way to shape the eyebrows and remove extra hair from the top and at the bottom also and in the middle. [CLS] [SEP]too it is best to shape , try to do n't remove the arch , keep the natural line of the arch and it gives a lot of beauty .also for this shape we have to use scissors and cut the extra hair , try to do n't remove the tail of the eyebrows. [CLS] [SEP]and then we have to cut long hair perfectly .this is the best way to shape eyebrows .
hi , i 'm masequa myers and we will talk about the fourth day of kwanzaa .and as you can see , we have been alternating our candles for each day of the kwanzaa celebration .we are now on the fourth day of kwanzaa , ujamaa .ujamaa , cooperative economics .cooperative economics .the definition is to build and maintain our stores , shops , businesses in our community and to profit from them together .ujamaa .and when the lighter of the candle for the principle for the day of kwanzaa lights and says , `` ujamaa , '' you repeat , `` ujamaa , '' and when the english definitions is said , `` cooperative economics , '' all those in attendance repeat , `` cooperative economics . [CLS] [SEP]''ujamaa .in our next clip , we will talk about the fifth day of kwanzaa and the fifth principle of kwanzaa .
okay ,leaving off from pose nine , i want to take you right into pose ten .i 'm going to bring my right. [CLS] [SEP], excuse me , i 'm going to bring my left foot all the way to the front of my body .and i 'm going to do that again for you .it 's my left foot coming from behind and now coming forward to cross over .and i 'm just going to keep my hands on my hips for pose number ten .again , remembering the fingers must stay relaxed and upward .the elbows are forward and pressed .and again , if you want to , in pose number ten , it creates a little freedom and fun , kind of feeling happy , to tilt the head a little bit .so you can tilt your head left or right , just to create the feeling of this. [CLS] [SEP]is a very fun pose to do .and this is pose number ten .
and we 're going to take it out of its rind. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to chop it up .alright you have your garlic , your fresh garlic .you just give it a little squeeze and you 'll see the outer shell starts to come off .we 're going to use a lot of garlic today .i 'll tell you this is a great garlic .if you love garlic. [CLS] [SEP]like i do , you 'll love ratatouille .going to use seven cloves of garlic .just going to take , just going to take the butt end of the knife , give it a little punch on our board and. [CLS] [SEP]you 'll see easily , how easily the shell comes out .you 're going to have this hard point on the top .just give that a little cut .get that off as well and there 's your garlic removed from its shell .alright .just be careful .just going to slice our garlic one way .going to try to get it chopped up real nice .so you just turn it. [CLS] [SEP]and you chop it that way .be careful you do n't cut yourself .and then just work the back of the knife , giving it a chop .and that 's all you want to do with all these cloves .i 'm going to chop it up real fine .alright. [CLS] [SEP]you can see our garlic is chopped very , very fine .make sure you work with it .it 's going to take a couple of minutes .just working the knife back and forth .you 'll see i 've got a beautiful , nicely minced garlic .we 're going to just add this to our bowl. [CLS] [SEP]and then we 're going to chop our onion. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to saute them up in a nice pot .and that 's the beginning of ratatouille here on expert village .come back .we 're making it .it 's fun. [CLS] [SEP], it 's fast , its easy .
scoring systems in pinochle , there are three , actually three primary ways that scoring is accomplished in the game .it does n't matter which one as long as you know what scoring system is going to be employed .progressive scoring , progressive scoring combines the add on feature and the use of not having the subtraction option but having the add on feature .let 's look for an example .supposing the opponents have bid sixty-five and they do have the required twenty meld and let 's just say that we happen to have twenty-two meld which is very important .let us suppose that they only had thirty meld , this is thirty meld right here .now they obviously have to pull the difference between thirty meld and sixty-five , they have to pull thirty-five counters .again , here 's the relationship between this and this .they have thirty meld , they have bid sixty-five , and they need thirty-five counters , thirty-five out of a possible fifty available in the play of the hand .if they fall short , if they fall short , they do n't get that thirty-five , right , then they have lost their bid and their bid goes over to our score .now if they only pulled say thirty counters. [CLS] [SEP]then we would have pulled the other twenty and we add that on to our meld plus their sixty-five .that 's a big haul for us. [CLS] [SEP]is n't it ?
the next stretch that we 're looking at is the cobra , or at least that 's what it 's referred to in yoga .it 's , you can do an elbow cobra , and what you 're trying to do is , you 're trying to keep your back straight , and you 're trying to cut yourself at your lower back , and trying to open up your abdomen , your hips , and trying to get some blood flow going through into your quadriceps , and through the major veins and arteries of the front of the body .now if you find yourself fairly flexible , try to come up even higher .but if your hips are coming up off the floor because of it , go back down , you 're not flexible enough yet to actually get there .but the more flexible you become , the more you can start working with it and trying to get your body to relax .so i 'm not quite at the point of being able to grab my feet ,but i can relax enough to keep my hips on the floor and keep everything relatively loose and easy going .stretch forward just to help stretch the shoulders out a little bit , bend the neck and the head , and try to continue relaxing the lower back , and that pelvis down , keep your shoulders light and relaxed .
so what is an interview .well a job interview is a formal meeting between a potential employee and employer or a potential employer .the job interview has two purposes .for the employer , it is to find the best person that is suited for that job .for you , the employee , it is an opportunity to find the best job that suits your needs and this happens through a series of questioning and exchange of information .now , when you 're getting ready to start looking for a job , especially if you are in college .sometimes college kids start as early as nine months , looking for a job , because the job interview process is actually quite lengthy .i 'm going to give you some quick statistics .for every ten jobs you interview , that 's the average , you 'll interview for ten jobs , in order to get one .so we really want to brush up your interviewing skills .you may go on a average of twenty to thirty job interviews before you find the right job for you , that wants to hire you .so fasten your seat belts , here we go .
the next penalty we 're going to show you is high sticking .the hand signal for this penalty is like this .and this happens when you bring your stick above your waist and you hit another opponent above the shoulders .usually the face area or the back of the head .something like that .that 's going to result in high sticking .and i 'm going to demonstrate it .first on another player , the player 's got the puck. [CLS] [SEP]and you bring your stick up to anywhere above the shoulders. [CLS] [SEP], you 're going to get called .also , this penalty can be called on a goalie .if i 'm skating here. [CLS] [SEP]and i bring my stick up. [CLS] [SEP]and it hits his face , his cage , the back of the head , you 're going to get called for high sticking .now if you high stick someone and they get a cut and they start bleeding , that can result in a double minor compared to just a regular minor for a basic high sticking penalty .
more often than not served with coca cola or pepsi or whatever you want and with jack daniels certainly the most well known brand of whiskey from america. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]not sure i can name anymore to be honest , but jack daniels for you .
in this clip we will be talking about the time signatures that are less common .they will include 5/4 , 9/8 , and 12/8 .so the first 5/4 is a time signature that can be divided up into either 2 3 or 3 2 , and it refers to whether it 's 2 3 or 3 2 depends on the piece and the music and the feeling of the music will define whether or not it 's a 2 3 or a 3 2 , and this can come up with a couple of different time signatures , and it will say a little 3 2 above the time signature .so , the 5/4 and a 2 3 pattern would be down , left , right , right , up , down , left , right , right , up .and then , a 3 2 would be down , left , left , right , up , left , left , right , up .so , that 's usually how you 'll do it , and it will say it in the score above the time signature if it 's a 2 3 or 3 2.the next is 9/8 , and that is one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine ; one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine ; and it 's pretty straightforward .12/8. [CLS] [SEP]is kind of like 9/8. [CLS] [SEP]it 's just three extra beats , so. [CLS] [SEP]it 's one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten , eleven , twelve ; one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten , eleven , twelve .so you 'll go down , right , right , left , left , left , right , right , right ,right , up , up , up .and , in books and stuff if you look up conducting in books , the patterns will be described exactly like that , so it exactly creates arches , and then to the right , and then up .and it makes a little more sense when you see it in a book .
drew noah :so , i showed you how to create regular playlists and folders and that 's pretty straight forward , not that complicated .now , i 'm going to show you how to make a smart playlist which is maybe even if you already use itunes. [CLS] [SEP], it 's something maybe you have n't thought about making yourself because it 's a little bit complicated but not really .and basically , what it is , is you set some parameters for a playlist and throughout , it will automatically add any songs that fit those parameters and whenever you add new music that fits the parameters , either by importing , buying from the itunes store , it will be added to that playlist .so , let me just show you how it works .you go to 'file ' , 'new smart playlist ' and you get an old pop-up box .so , you just get to set up some rules. [CLS] [SEP]and then the playlist will be populated by songs that fit those rules .so , you see that the rules that we can set , these are all the things that you see in itunes .you see name , time , artists ; these are all the possible things that you can see .just for an example , i 'll pick the 'name ' which is the song name. [CLS] [SEP]and then you pick the parameter which is contains , does not contain , is ,is not , starts with , ends with .so , it contains all type of words , in any song name that has that word , anywhere in the name will be there and the opposite for does not contain is -- means , it is exactly that .so , if i type two words , it will be exactly those two words .is not , just the opposite and then starts and ends with , pretty self-explanatory .but contains is probably the easiest one to demonstrate .let 's just see -- make a smart playlist of every song that contains the word `` love '' .and then your other options are to limit it to a certain amount items and when you do limit it , you select by random or you select by these parameters , match. [CLS] [SEP]only checked items and live updating ; this is when if i import a new cd that match these parameters , it would be added automatically .so , probably , you want to keep that checked because that 's the coolest thing about smart playlist. [CLS] [SEP], it 's the way they will automatically be updated .so , that 's kinda cool .you see all these songs i have songs that have the word `` love '' on the title .but more practical smart playlists , this , the recently added is one that automatically comes with -- when you start itunes .and that 's pretty handy especially when you have a big library to just see what you 've put in recently .and what i 've done , i have these folders for genres and. [CLS] [SEP]what i 've done is i 've created playlists. [CLS] [SEP]-- that 's how you edit a smart playlist right there if you just want to right click , 'edit smart playlist ' .so , i got these regular playlists that are genre. [CLS] [SEP]so every time i import a new cd , i 'll just drag them into that , into this genre .and then i created this recent indie playlist that 's going to take anything in that playlist .the playlist is ipod indie. [CLS] [SEP]and then i created another rule by clicking on the + button and the 'date added 'is in the last two weeks .so , that way i can see anything that i 've added to my genre playlist that is new in the last two weeks or in my smart playlist .so , that just gives you an idea of what you can do with a smart playlist .and i 'm just going to go back in and show you a couple more things .remember to create a new rule or multiple rules , you just click this + button , you can subtract or take one off .and the more rules you create , the more narrow scope your playlist can be if that makes sense .'cause you have two parameters that a song has to meet just to be in your playlist .so , that is you smart playlist .
and now you know two pieces to this .the harmony parts and the first violin parts to them .there 's lots of other short pieces that you could learn that also have harmony parts , so that you could make it learning to play the violin a fun experience for you and your friends .
i 'm late for what ?oh , oh , hold on , hold on .hi , i 'm rokosz your digital life style expert .are you late for things ,where 's your calendar , you carry around that heavy day planner , uh huh , no more .i 'm going to show you how to put dates and events in to your calendar function on the iphone .first thing as always , push your home button to turn it on , slide to unlock it .then you can go right up to your calendar icon .now you can actually , you know , you can see when we recorded this because it 's obviously saturday the twentieth .alright. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's right. [CLS] [SEP]this. [CLS] [SEP]so you can always see it without going in to your calendar function .going to tap that little icon right there , and you 're going to see the calendar .now luckily you can see my calendar 's a little light .the little dots here tell me that i 've got an event .so let 's see what happened on september first on monday , oh , i got an important labor day all day long .actually one of the neat parts is you can subscribe to all. [CLS] [SEP]pre done calendar .in fact that one has been loaded in to my ical because i chose to assign all major us holidays. [CLS] [SEP]so i never forget them ,mothers day , you know what i mean ?alright. [CLS] [SEP]so that 's one of the things there .so if i want to see it by day , bloop , right there , i can see a list of all the things that i have coming up .uh oh , got to be careful of valentines day , presidents day , ohhh , halloween ,my favorite , day light savings time ; that all i really have other than ground hogs day , awesome .to go back to the calendars there , and now i also have all sorts of calendars that i work with , work , holidays we talked about , for the entourage. [CLS] [SEP], our crew schedules birthdays , then to a data base , and right back there .so we can go back and you can choose exactly what calendar you want to see and which events are coming up .if you need to add one on the fly , like everything else , hit the add button .got ta add , hit the add button .title and location , i can go ahead and put that in there , the title of it , a meeting , where , here at the studio , go ahead and save it , it starts , it ends .again , once you 've tapped that , you have one of my favorite features , it 's going to be on december nine at two o'clock pm ,same and all you do. [CLS] [SEP]is go down .you want an alert , which calendar does it go to ; it 's just that easy .when you 're done , hit done and you 're back to your calendar .with a couple of taps , follow the prompts , you want to add something , hit plus , add , hit plus and just put in the information you need .you take it with you , populates the other calendars , it awesome .and i 'm rokosz , your digital life style expert , saying stream you later .
now we 're going to work on some arm and leg cardio .so you were just moving your legs like so , but you want to make. [CLS] [SEP], you want to do a little extra work .we have this exercise tubing here on the leg stepper , the stair master , and what we want to do is we want to add our arms , just taking them up and down , up and down .now with this exercise , trying to keep my arms up , with the same speed as my legs .and i 'm really going to feel my heart rate increase .i 'm going to feel myself become maybe short of breath , but i 'm exercising both my arms and my legs .i 'm really feeling it in my shoulders , my triceps , my biceps .oh it feels great .only a hundred more , and then i 'll be to the top of. [CLS] [SEP], i do n't know , where am i going ?philadelphia , climbing the stairs , just like our friend sylvester stallone in rocky , there we go .keep going .up and down .push and pull , push and pull , getting the full range of motion .oh yeah , it 's a good workout today .and that is how you can do some great arm and leg cardio on the stair master .
hi , my name is vlad cardema .today i 'm going to show you how i make these peruvian flutes .i specialize in making these flutes , and i make didgeridoos and drums , but today i 'll show you how to make a peruvian style flute out of black bamboo .you 're going to need clamps to clamp down your work .to clamp down the material , i use this bench with this vice , woodwork vice .and this clamp system that i learned from woodworking , it 's just a piece of wood that has a `` v '' cut into it , and it enables a round flute to sit in there. [CLS] [SEP]and i use this rope to clamp it down .that way i can drill the holes , and make the mouthpiece , and it makes it easier and manageable .
so i showed you how to insert a battery , your other option for power is using your , plugging your camera in directly into your wall .obviously this is only going to work when you have an outlet nearby. [CLS] [SEP]so i definitely recommend getting those longer lasting batteries and not even worrying about this , but basically you are going to take your charger and instead of using it to charge your battery. [CLS] [SEP]you are going to use it to connect your camera to the wall. [CLS] [SEP]so we 'll hook up the outlet side just like that. [CLS] [SEP]and then we want to take this little doohickey and plug it in up here. [CLS] [SEP]and then just like you inserted the battery you are going to take this and open up your battery case and then with the arrow pointing toward the lens of the camera that is how you insert it .and just like a battery slide it in till it clicks .it releases the same way too , right here , but you have got this cord to mess with. [CLS] [SEP]so what they have done for that is when you close it. [CLS] [SEP], you see there is kind of a little opening here to let you run the cord out , that you do n't need when you have a battery obviously , but when you have a cord just open that up and let it go straight down and then just like the battery , to get it out. [CLS] [SEP]we 'll just release it right here. [CLS] [SEP]and it pops right out. [CLS] [SEP]so that is how you can plug your xh a1 into the wall if you need to , but. [CLS] [SEP]like i said ,i really like using batteries and not even having to mess with plugging it into to the wall .the only reason i would plug into the wall is if i was going to put it on a tripod and was just going to shoot for hours. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're not moving. [CLS] [SEP]so that 's how you plug your camera into the wall .
now we 've already melted the butter and as you can see the sugar is nicely melted in with the butter. [CLS] [SEP]so it is almost like a paste right now .once again , i emphasize do not turn the heat up too high .we just want this at a nice low heat just so that it simmers .we do n't want that sugar to burn .if you turn the heat up too high , that sugar will burn and it is going to give it kind of a burnt flavor. [CLS] [SEP]and that is not what we want .so it is a very fine adjustment when it comes to this .now as you can see , everything is blended nicely together .it is just bubbling slightly which is just where we want it .so now what we are going to do is add the banana liqueur .you can either use a banana liqueur or banana flavored rum .basically what we want to do is just add a little bit of that banana flavor into that sugar mixture just to give it that flavor .the thing about bananas foster is that it is a blend of all these that give it that really good flavor .
now in this clip we 're going to go over different ways to go into our wushu , and instead of doing the steps , different ways to build up our momentum .maybe just try taking one step , or we 're going to go over how to do a reverse hook kick into a wushu , or even do a cartwheel into a wushu .so the first one i 'm going to work on is just taking one step now instead of two .so now instead of going step , step going into a wushu , we 're just going to practice doing it off one step and just try to build up momentum from there .so just step one time around , dip , and go into it .so one more time , so i 'm going to put my other leg in front .and that is going to be my one step into my wushu .now let 's go ahead and do it off of a reverse hook kick .now instead of doing one step , we 're going to put our right leg in front because i always like to go off. [CLS] [SEP]my left first and then kick up my right .spin around , kick , set it down , dip , and go into our wushu .so it 's going to look like this .one more time .and that 's going to be a hook kick into a wushu .now the next one , the last one we 're going to do is a cartwheel into a wushu .one more time , cartwheel .so as you can see , there are several different ways to go into your wushu .if you just want to use a wushu for a performance , if you do n't have your butterfly twist down .but those are some good ways to go into it instead of doing that step , step , all the way around .
because when it grows in you do n't have a line of demarcation .it 's just the best way to blend it in .it gives it more longevity .when you color , one step color usually. [CLS] [SEP]it 's a little bit more maintenance .
now the next thing i want to talk about you might not even realize that you do it because some people just tend to be this way .now what i 'm talking about is avoiding an abusive tone .tone of voice says a whole lot .it can sometimes even say more than the words that we choose .so when you 're making a criticism , you do n't want to get a nasty tone or even a loud tone or any kind of irritated tone .watch your tone .because sometime your tone can be even more attacking .i , i did n't , i did n't like the way you did that .o.k .you chose the correct words .i did n't like .i made it about me but my tone is still very harsh and still very criticizing .so no matter how difficult it is , you 've got to pick a nicer tone when delivering criticism .
hi , this is yolanda vanveen from vanveenbulbs.com. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to learn all about the ice plant and how to grow ice plant or lampranthus .it 's a beautiful plant from south africa .lampranthus or ice plant is called ice plant because if you notice , the growth looks just like little icicles .they look like icicles hanging down .they 're really , really pretty. [CLS] [SEP]and they make a beautiful ground cover .and i love their bright purple flowers .i remember the first time i went to san diego .i got off the airplane and they were everywhere on the side of the road just bright pink carpets of color .and it was just gorgeous .and apparently they are invasive now and they 're becoming a problem down there , so they can become invasive in lots of different areas .so you kind of have to be careful with them .but i love them in areas of full , hot sun , around rocks , someplace where they can really grow and you can keep control of them as they multiply because they will take over this whole bed if i let them in the next fifty years .i love them .it 's easy to grow them .they pretty much do n't need you as long as you put them in another spot and as long as i just dig up a couple starts .and they 're very easy to grow .and really all you need is a couple pieces .you do n't even have to have many roots. [CLS] [SEP]because i 've noticed with them wherever they connect , wherever all the pieces connect , there 's a tiny root or a pub .but saying that , i just put little pieces on the ground and put some dirt on top of them and they 'll sprout right out of that .so you can try to actually take a perfect root , or. [CLS] [SEP]what i 've done pretty much with this bed. [CLS] [SEP]is i. [CLS] [SEP]'ve. [CLS] [SEP]just , i 've just kind of made a little trough , set them in there. [CLS] [SEP]and then just kind of let a couple of them come out of the ground and cover the rest up .and what happens is these others will make roots .and you can try with roots , but even little pieces .even though it was just like a handful of starts , it did n't look like much .i just put them in the ground and made three more starts out of it .it 's that easy .
white wine it does n't matter just something like this , give them a little spoon so they can spoon out a little bit of the salsa with the sour cream and a little chives .you just tell them to take a little dip in a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're in heaven. [CLS] [SEP], these are. [CLS] [SEP]so please make these cause they are that good. [CLS] [SEP]these are awesome .great super bowl half time. [CLS] [SEP], you 're going to have a great super bowl show with these so at half time put these out your guests will love you for them , they 're great for everything .to your appetizers , cocktail hour to your events make them as far as cost twenty dollars or less i actually made everything here that you see. [CLS] [SEP], it 's an army with a small army for about sixteen bucks .so depending on where you live , i say a little bit on the twenty considered. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]a nyc pour yourself some wine with your friends .eat with your friends , get your kids to cook in the kitchen. [CLS] [SEP]you 'll save money and you 'll be able to buy nice cookware. [CLS] [SEP]and it 'll pay for itself .my name is richard buccola on behalf of expert village. [CLS] [SEP]thank you for watching .
where in the heck can you buy and try ginjo sake ?what i like doing is i like pressing the ownership and the responsibility of buying and maintaining sake on the restaurants .one of my favorite things to do is to go to restaurants and try multiple brews in that restaurant before i go and purchase a bottle by themselves .now a lot of restaurants will move sake in the form of flights .they will actually have a little flight of three different brews , a ginjo , a daiginjo and a junmai , let 's say .but what i recommend if you want to start exploring and trying sake , definitely go to your local sushi restaurant , and you 'll know that they 'll have i , and then try to go to more cutting edge , western restaurants that might introduce sake on the menu as well .now if you 're in a place that does n't have a lot of sushi , you 're kind of out of luck ; what you 're going to have to do is you 're going to have to come. [CLS] [SEP], maybe go to some of the google websites that do some shipping , on line shipping .now , that said , i opened my store roughly six years ago and in that time i was the first dedicated sake store outside of japan , really in the history of selling sake .even in japan they do n't have dedicated sake stores , they have that sell , they 'll sell sake and shochu and beer and all the other things .but since i 've been , i call my store true sake , america 's true sake store , since that time now three other dedicated sake stores have come on line , in new york city and in oregon and here also in san francisco .now , go to your wine merchant , go to your local wine shop and ask those guys to start carrying some sakes too .they will , gladly .sake is the future .you 're hearing it here first .and they want to learn too. [CLS] [SEP]and they want to move products .more sake is being pushed sort of in the mid-west .the skins of the country are saturated with sake .you can get them in japan towns , in big cities , you can get them in asian towns and other cities , you can definitely get them in any sushi restaurant , like i said .but wine stores and even liquor stores are starting to carry some brews .i just recommend starting with sakes that maybe have been imported , and then definitely try some of our local brews .but again , i would go to your local wine shop and say , hey is there a way that you can start carrying sakes ?and i myself am from the mid-west. [CLS] [SEP]and i know that there are a lot of brews in the mid-west .you just have to be a little bit resourceful. [CLS] [SEP]and you have to find them .
in this clip , we 're going to talk about gem crafting .now , in the world of warcraft there are thirteen professions .there are three secondary skills and ten primary professions .now , the primary profession we 're going to talk about of course. [CLS] [SEP]is gem crafting .gem crafting is a skill that is exactly what it sounds like .if you go to a jeweler in the real world , he can cut stones to make facets .and , so you get your diamond ring and you get married and you live happily ever after .in the world of warcraft , you can do the same kind of thing .now , the gems that you 're using of course many of them have magical properties .for example , you could make a diamond ring in the world of warcraft .but , it would be a magical diamond ring .you can also use things like bracelets and necklaces .or , gems that you plug into your weapons or armor to make them more powerful .and , some examples of gem crafting things are different buffs that are inherent buffs .like , for example if you were to enchant something you could put a magical enchantment on something .and , give yourself more strength .you could do the same thing with gems .you could cut a magic gem and put it in your sword and give yourself more strength that way .it 's just another way of doing something. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's why you would take the profession gem crafting .so , if you have the profession gem crafting you would go down here to your spell book .come up here to gem crafting , go here and here are some things that you can make .now , currently what we are able to make are things like an inlaid malachite ring .in order to make it , we would need certain raw materials like copper bars and malachite .something we have the materials for right now is a pendant a malachite pendant .we have malachite .we have delicate copper wire .so , we could make a malachite pendant .now , if we were to do that that 's a necklace basically .and , if we were to wear that necklace it would raise our agility attribute by two points .so , that 's just one example of what you can do with gem crafting .you can make things like rings and that sort of thing and necklaces and stuff .
that is one of the reasons why it cooks so quickly is that it is much much smaller .today we are cooking this black bean in a pressure cooker .i have just done a quick soak with it .we have emptied all the water out and put the bean that we just cooked for 2 minutes. [CLS] [SEP]and we went ahead and put it back in the pressure cooker with 6 cups of water .we are going to go ahead and bring it up to 15 pounds of pressure , cook it for about 10 minutes .just let it sit there on the stove without the burner on or anything for about 10 minutes .these would be done and i really hope that you would be motivated to run out and make some black bean salsa it. [CLS] [SEP]so good .it is a great dinner for tonight .thank you so much .
now that we have all the rolls for our body we 're ready to roll the paper for the head .as you can see in this piece here , we have a wider piece and we 're also changing the direction of the roll so that it gives it more of the longer head for the body against the perpendicular more narrow shape of the body .so here we go. [CLS] [SEP]we 're going to cut about four inches wide .cutting a strip out of the same paper that we cut the body out of. [CLS] [SEP]and we probably do n't need it this long .we can give it a try , wrapping it up .that 's a pretty big head , i 'm going to cut it down just a little bit .if the head ends up going off the surface of the poster board , that 's okay .it 's still going to be able to attach it just fine .so once we have the right size and shape we 'll give it a try .that looks good .we 're going to need a long piece of masking tape as we go over the entire overlapping section of the head .and line. [CLS] [SEP]that up , you want to make sure that 's. [CLS] [SEP]it 's on both sides so that it holds it in place .we 're going to trim that off the edge .and that will give us our head .
biedermeier , biedermeier is your life style .what i could say because , we use this word today as well , especially furnitures that are very popular today .it 's the bourgeois lifestyle .if you have a biedermeier table , a bierdermeir arm chair , then you can feel yourself as a real as a real bourgeois , that you live in a calm family in a ,so it 's about also about community and family and warmness and so on .and that is the saying we can recognize on the painting , in the topics , in the style as well .
now i 'm going to talk about some reasons why your clarinet will not play .we are going to start off with our mouthpiece here .if your mouthpiece has any kind of damage to the face , or any chips on the mouthpiece , it surely will not play .as well as if your cork appeared does not fit the barrel properly , and it leaks up there , it will not play properly .probably the most common thing that happens while your clarinet will not play is because of this adjustment screw right up here on your a , a flat key .they 're usually needs just be a little bit of motion in between those two keys because one opens up the other .and you can imagine if that 's the screw is tightened down too far. [CLS] [SEP]then it lifts the other key up as well which in turn will make your instrument leak and your clarinet will not play .some other things are bent keys , anything something stuck in your instrument , your register vent could be clogged , that is another reason .but , mostly it 's either because the pad fell out , leaks , or adjustment regulations .but those are some reasons why your clarinet wo n't play .
i 'm a professional photographer from austin , texas .i 'm going to load my pinhole camera with polaroid 669 film .i 'm going to take my film .i 'm going to load it in with the paper side facing the lens .i 'm going to be very gentle when loading the film .i do not want to touch this film right there .very bad .this film is kind of pricey .take it paper facing the lens .i put it in. [CLS] [SEP]and i close the camera back .again the back is closed and that is how i 'm going to load my pinhole camera .once i know that the back is closed. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to make sure that it is working. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's in there properly. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'm ready to take pictures with my camera .
okay , now let 's bead our ... [CLS] [SEP]our picture frame .first , i want to put a little heart up in the corner .i 'm just going to draw the heart with my glue .and then just fill the heart in .i have a nice , thick amount of glue here , and this is a nice , thick glue that 's going to hold the beads .okay , you can fix the shape of your heart or design using a toothpick or ... [CLS] [SEP]or a skewer like this , just to kind of work out anything that you did n't like.there. [CLS] [SEP], i like the shape of that a little bit better .and then , you just sprinkle on your beads , being very generous .do n't worry about the ones falling , you 'll pick those up later .and you can pat them down , just to set them ... [CLS] [SEP]get them embedded in the glue .okay .let that dry a little bit , and then we 'll just shake off the excess beads .when the glue becomes tacky , if you want to fix up the shape of your heart at this point , you can do that just using a toothpick or a skewer .and you can just move the glue. [CLS] [SEP], it 's nice and thick , and you just move the beads around to shape ...shape up that heart nicely .
we also have some liquid eyeliner .this is important .this is in liquid form .we are also going to have some lip gloss which we are going to apply for a nice glossy look on our lips .we are also going to have a lip brush as well to apply make-up to our lips .in addition we are going to have our lip liner .we will also have a pair of slightly gaudy fake eyelashes we are going to use for our nurse .followed by some eye shadow again to color in the eye regions above the eye .and we also have a fun tool a lot of women are familiar with an eyelash curler for our nurse today .and last but certainly not least we are going to have some nice bright brilliant lipstick .
now it 's also good to smile .other types of business situations , compliments , praise , always when you are receiving a compliment or praise , you always want to smile .now , compliments and praise sometimes make people feel a little bit uncomfortable .again , if you smile that will help ease your discomfort , but it also shows that you appreciate being recognized , you appreciate the accolade .maybe the boss comes up and introduces you as the best secretary in the pool , or whatever it is. [CLS] [SEP], you want to smile , you want to show your gratitude , you want to show your thanks .the same goes for when you 're giving a compliment or giving some kind of praise .by smiling , it shows a bit of sincerity .i 'm going to give you this compliment. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to give you a friendly smile , to show you that i really mean it , that you 're doing a good job , that you are a good employee , that i really appreciate what it is that you 're doing for us here .so , smiling on compliments and praise in both directions , very important .
he 's a rose-breasted cockatoo .they 're native to australia , and floyd is approximately six years old .he can be quite a talker .many birds talk .some do n't .for those of us who love them , it matters not whether they do , or they do n't .it does n't change the amount we love them .however , floyd says a number of things , and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm hoping he 'll say them today , and i 'm going to test that theory right now .give me a kiss .give me a kiss .many people are curious as to why birds talk , or how they talk .they actually do n't have a voice box as we do .they have air sacs , and they 're able to talk by manipulating air , over and through those air sacs .why do they talk ?they talk for a couple of reasons .generally , they talk because they 've heard something that they like , and they enjoy replicating sounds .floyd says , as i said , a number of things , and he also says what a cute bird , what a cute floyder .i do n't know that he 'll go through that whole repertoire today , and i would tend to doubt it , because the other thing is , that birds do n't always do what you want them to do .they seem to exercise a fair amount of free will , so if you ever see someone performing with a bird , and the bird is talking quite a bit , that means probably that the bird is happy , and that the bird is very well focused .it 's very difficult to get a bird to perform in front of an audience , that they 're not familiar with .in fact , often , it 's difficult to get them to perform in front of an audience at all , so appreciate those people who train them , so that they can do that .floyd , and a lot of other birds , will also talk a lot when i 'm not paying much attention to them .i have , and some of the best talkers , are this little guy , again a rose-breasted cockatoo .also , a number of the amazons , and i have a couple of amazons , who will say hello , and say it louder and louder , until i acknowledge them .birds have learned that we pay attention , i guess , when they talk , and they do it for that reason , so let 's see if floyd is going to talk again .what a cute bird .oh , he liked that .you going to give me a kiss ?give me a kiss .give me a kiss .give me a kiss .he also makes the kissing noise , which is kind of cute , but he does have a repertoire .i think he 's going to limit it today , because he 's trying to play hard to get .if you 're trying to teach a bird to talk , just remember they 're a lot like children .if you want them to talk , you need to talk to them .a lot of people say to me , my bird does n't talk , and they sound disappointed in that .just speak to your bird , and you 'll find that like a child , many of them will respond .
i 'm gon na plate these together .again , this is our one meal , all out of oven , easy stuff , turn into entire casserole dishes .i 'm gon na plate this all together and see what it tastes like .let 's see. [CLS] [SEP], i see a piece of chicken right here .i 'll get the chicken right here .oh , my goodness .it 's nice and hot .get some of that rice .see if i can mix this together with the cream of mushroom soup .i love rice with cream of mushroom soup .oh my goodness .it is amazing .alright , get as much of the rice as you like .then let 's get some dump cake over here , too .you know what ?this corner looks so good .this is hot , so be careful .oh my goodness , look at that .this is great .this has n't cooled very long .if it cools , it would set a little bit more , so , i would let it cool , maybe ten minutes before you serve it , maybe while you 're eating the chicken .i could n't wait .let me get that right there .go back for a fork .let 's try that out .let 's see , look at the inside of the chicken .it 's just perfect .you can tell it 's really tender. [CLS] [SEP], it 's not dry at all .it 's completely cooked through .get a piece of chicken .i want the whole bite in there , all of it .it 's gon na be hot .it 's good .everything 's seasoned perfectly .just that little salt and pepper on the chicken really helps flavor that out .it 's so great to come home to , you know , your family comes home after school or work , this is a meal all right here , the chicken and rice .oh , that 's so good .really great on a cold day , too .okay , on to dessert .i want that crusty part .oh my gosh , it 's steaming .i 'm gon na blow it .it 's really hot .i love this dessert .it 's so good !and really , it 's not heavy .and i know we put butter on top , but the cherries are so really light .it 's not heavy at all .there 's some richness in the crust , but again the crust is really thin compared to all the cherries you got going on .so , it 's like a little icing on the cake on top .so as rich as that little crust is , the cherries are so nice and light .this is an entire meal right here .how easy was that ?
for women ’ s self defense you want to know how to strike whether it would be with your hands or your feet .if you 're going to kick , which is really effective , you need to know how to kick as well .for a round house kick you need to use the top of your foot here .you do n't want to keep your toes up because that could damage your toes or break them. [CLS] [SEP]and you do n't really want to use the inside or the side of your foot. [CLS] [SEP]but the top of your foot .if an assailant were to come in and you felt threatened by that , this would be a good opportunity to come either to the outside of the leg against the calf or the outside against the thigh here .it would be here or here .it 's really effective .i really like the thigh point right here .if you come in , use your hips here , or to the side .
so you take your sponge , and you 're going to have to get it wet , and then you 're just going to take your glaze , and you 're going to dunk it in the glaze , and offload it on the side of the bucket .you can even squeeze it if you like , although i do n't have gloves on .you probably want to wear gloves , and you want to take the part of the sponge , that has the texture , and we 're just going to put it around the wall , and the thing about sponging , that you need to overcome , that i think is not very attractive , is if you just do that sort of thing , so you want to be softer , blend it , have some movement .i 'll wipe that off , but not a lot , and you just move the paint around , and you can do this with multiple colors .start with one color , and today , since we 're using sort of a camel tone , you could use taupe ,a linen white , brown , and that is pretty much what sponging looks like .it 's very easy , it 's very quick , but you really need to pay attention , to not forcing the sponge on the wall , because you 'll get what i think , is just a sponged , not very sophisticated look .that is sponging , and i 'm lorna campodonico .
hi , i 'm travis corpening , and i 'm about to teach you , just how to do a reverse layup .here we are at carolina beach recreation center , and the first thing you want to do , when you 're trying to do a reverse layup , is you want to be able to jump from one side of the goal , at least to the other side of the rim , so once you take off , you want to position yourself to where , when you 're taking off , you 're already prepared , before you even jump .you 're all ready prepared , to make it , on the other side of the rim .now , by preparing yourself before you get to the other side of the rim , what you do is , you allow yourself more time to adjust to the defense , to have your mind and body adjust to the defense , for whatever may happen , while you 're in the air , so that you can complete the shot , so what you do , is you take off , reach with your opposite hand .if you 're coming from the left side of the basket , you want to complete it with your right hand .if you 're coming from the right side of the basket , you want to complete it with your left hand , but you can interchange , if you 're skilled enough .after you come from the other side of the basket , you want to reach around , and you either want to spin it , or you want to tap it , right in the middle of the box , over the top of the rim .once you do this , practice it a few times , and it 's a really effective shot , during the game , when you 're in a tight squeeze , and the defense is really playing you down low .there you have it , the reverse layup .
because this is one thing that you can not fake at all .sincerity is one thing that you have to have it. [CLS] [SEP]or you do n't .you can smile ; you can do these little things that really enhance how you 're going to sound .especially to the listeners .it 's one thing , when we 're sharing a medium like television right now , but when you 're communicating with someone on the radio , they 're listening to you .you may be talking to a whole lot of people , but it 's one at a time .and you 've got to have that sincerity .the way that you address the client , you 've got to know your audience .and with mic technique as well .we all want to have that big , bassy voice , but you 're stuck with what you 're blessed with .you can use different mics that may enhance and try to add a bit more bass to your voice .but once again , listeners do n't really care too much about that .they want to hear someone that they feel comfortable listening to .someone that has that sincerity , that friendly voice , someone that they can listen to .because they have that friendship , they have that bond with you .they 're going to listen to you for a long time .you 've got to have that sincerity .sincerity works , and that 'll keep you going for years to come .
for the next clip , we 're going to go over the platinum compressor .the platinum compressor , basically , is another compressor that 's on logic that is pretty good .i use it a lot .it has a couple of different options that you can switch from .so what we 're going to do is we 're going to go into our bussed track and go to `` dynamics '' and add the compressor .now , the platinum is the circuit type .there 's a lot of different circuit types in here. [CLS] [SEP]and you should experiment with all of them .opto is a more warmer one. [CLS] [SEP]and there 's a couple of different other ones .just basically , it 's just different types of circuitry , which produces different types of sound .now , when playing our track , what we could do is adjust things like the compressor threshold as well as the ratio .( music plays ) .i 'm going to put it a little bit higher .you can actually feel a little bit of that bass .so , what i 'm going to do , is i 'm going to turn it down a little ; turn it down. [CLS] [SEP]so we get around negative six as harmonic gain reduction and maybe turn the `` auto gain '' on .( music plays ) .
okay , those are just some examples of self-destructive beliefs that you might have .your self-destructive beliefs might be that you 're a bad mother , or that you 're a bad daughter , or whatever it is .the first thing that we have to do if we 're going to attack these self-destructive beliefs -- which is what we 're going to do -- because the self-destructive beliefs have to go in order for us to improve our self-esteem .so the first thing that we have to do , and you have to tell yourself , really whether you believe it or not , and probably in the beginning you wo n't , you have to realize and tell yourself that these things are unrealistic .you think you 're a bad employee .are you really ?well , probably not .it is unrealistic .are you really a bad mother because you did n't get your child to school on time ?no .that 's unrealistic , okay .you have to put all of these self-destructive beliefs in perspective , and realize that ninety-nine percent of them are unrealistic .and you have to start telling yourself that .and i 'm going to give you some tips in just a minute for how exactly to do that .
now we are going to clean up which is a really important part of the ceramic process. [CLS] [SEP]and it is a good time to unwind and gather your thoughts for the next day , what you want to throw , what you want to make and get all your tools , i like to take all my tools that i 've just used that have clay on them and throw them in my slop bucket including the wire and let them soak .while they soak i 'm just going to put this over here on my stool. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to get up and clean your wheel off because these things are precious and you have got a nice clean wheel and a nice clean work space. [CLS] [SEP]next time you go to get busy .it does n't have to be perfect but chunks of clay is what you want to watch out for because if chunks of clay get in your pots and. [CLS] [SEP]there is no point , you could have porcelain or you can be working with earthen ware or you can be working with a different type of clay body and. [CLS] [SEP]as you introduce that clay body into a different type of clay body it could be disastrous in the kiln .one thing melts at a different temperature. [CLS] [SEP]so you want to keep all your clays separate. [CLS] [SEP]and then this is going to go in my slop bucket .if i were going to be working for a few more hours i would keep this out until it dried out or i could wedge it and put it back in my clay bag. [CLS] [SEP]but it is going to go in my slop bucket. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to recycle in there .we will take all of this slop that i save. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm not going to throw any more and put it all down in there. [CLS] [SEP]and it will dissolve. [CLS] [SEP]and then you will be reclaim this clay and use it time and time again .
he 's one of the greatest rock and roll guitarists of all time , and mitch mitchell is one of the greatest rock and roll drummers of all time .so i 'm going to show you a drum beat that he used very often .he kind of popularized it .i 'm also going to show you the six eight field , which is used in a lot of blues .i 'm going to show you how those are played .i 'm going to show you what they look like on paper .i 'm going to show you how to add fills to them , and i 'm going to just break it down , and make it nice and easy for you to play .so , get out your drumsticks , and get ready to do some more rock and roll .
in this segment i 'm going to show you how to take care the redness .as you could see in the areas that i apply the wax and remove the hair his skin is red that is a complete normal thing , you could just tell you client that it should go away with in a hour or two .stay tune to the next segment which i 'm going to show you how to make a soothing booster .
alright , welcome back .i 'm bobby larew , your expert on diving .we 're in the hurdle phase of our front approach , ok.we 've done the approach , now we 're in the hurdle phase .here 's what we just talked about , pointing the feet ant the toes .now we 'll talk about your legs .this is a really tricky part , ok.so i want to walk through both legs .remember my take off leg is my right leg .so when i 'm in my last step , my fifth step , i 'm going to put my weight on to this leg because the more weight and power and push i get on this leg , the farther the board will go down , ok.so i 'm pushing the board down with this leg .my back leg , ok , it 's a little tricky , is going to come up in to a 90 degree position , ok , or a backwards l ,ok.so , in my hurdle , my right leg , which is my take off leg , is pushing in to the board getting ready to jump .my left leg is coming up to a 90 degree angle , ok.remember my foot is tucked against my other knee , alright .now , if you 're take off leg is your left leg , i 'll do it on the other side. [CLS] [SEP]so you do n't get confused , ok.my left leg is take off .my left leg and my feet are pushing in to board to get power , to make the board bend .my right leg is going to come up , still a 90 degree angle .it 's going to look like an l , ok.remember , you 're right foot now is tucked in to your left knee .that 's what happens on your legs in the hurdle part of diving .
before you start rolling you want to dust your work surface with some confectioners sugar and you want to keep that surface dusted throughout the rolling process so that we can lift up our sheet of fondant after we have it rolled .so make a piece like this. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to roll it sort of wide and flat .and you want to roll it until it 's about a quarter inch to an eighth inch. [CLS] [SEP]and it 'll be a little wider on the top and thinner on the bottom .this is probably the most difficult part about making the cake .but the fondant is actually very forgiving .it stretches and it molds .so i 'm going to keep going .now you want to check once in a while to make sure that it is not sticking to the board and. [CLS] [SEP]you can , see it 's stuck a little here , you can slide more confectioners sugar underneath , and then continue your rolling .you 're going to need to roll it out long enough to cover , wide enough to cover the skirt of the cake here .that 's about eight inches .and long enough to go around the cake .okay , you can continue to dust the board or your work surface with confectioner ?s sugar .and do n't worry if you get on the top , it 'll dust right off .okay , and when it looks big enough , we 'll apply it to the cake .
auto play mode is a mode for playback of images that will automatically play all of the images , in sequence , that you 've taken and shot , on your memory card .it 's useful for , it 's kind of like a slide show .it 's useful for displaying your work , without actually having to pull it off of your camera .what you can do , also , is hook up your camera to a larger screen for viewing .but in our case , we 're just going to play back the images automatically on our 40d .to get to this option , you need to press the menu button , which is in the top left corner of your camera .go ahead and press `` menu '' .and , i 'm going to scroll over here to the second playback menu .it 's a blue , it 's got a blue icon up here at the top of the triangle pointing to your right , and there will be two dots in the upper right hand corner .once i 'm on that menu , i can scroll down with my quick control dial to auto play .auto play is highlighted with a blue rectangle , and i 'm just going to press `` set '' .now auto play is loading .it should begin playing my images for a couple of seconds at a time , and then switching to the next image in that sequence .and you can see that it 's actually rotating through the images sequentially .i 've got 26 images , and i 'm playing number 14 , now number 15 , and number 16.and , to pause this , i 'm going to press `` set '' .the playback mode will just be paused .that image will continue to be displayed .but , if i want to exit from the auto play mode , image mode , i just need to press `` menu '' again up here on the top left of your body .go ahead and press `` menu '' , and that takes you all the way back to the menu .and you can navigate to a different option in your menu or exit completely .
so let 's take a look .if you 're not already there , we 're talking about the homepage. [CLS] [SEP]so you want to click on home on the right hand side of your screen .once you 're on the homepage this is basically a page that tells you about the status of what other people are doing on their facebook site .for instance that 's the news feed. [CLS] [SEP]so you 'll know if some of your friends have posted new photos or put up new information or written new wall posts , that the news feed portion of it .on the right hand side you 'll see something that people love to do , poke other people on facebook .you 'll notice that stephen has poked me , now i can either poke him back or i can remove the poke .so if we hit poke , he 's going to get a poke back on his facebook profile back from me .you 'll notice a great feature to his birthday 's , everybody tends to forget people 's birthday 's or there are so many people to remember birthday 's nowadays .this is a great reminder since you put in your profile information when your birthday is , when that information is coming up , the next friend on your list who 's having a birthday , it 's going to be written there .the homepage is a great information page to refer back to .as you 'll see new stuff , new stuff on the new stuff you 'll notice today 's new gift .for instance is a cuddled monkey , if you want to give the gift right there you can do that as well .so the homepage really gives you an overview of everything that you can be doing on facebook and what your friends are doing as well , as you 'll notice there on the news feed .now that we 've had a look at the homepage , another very important page is actually called your account page .in this upcoming clip we 'll have a look at the account page and also the privacy overview that facebook offers .
i 'll use the two together here in a second .this is a string driver like a violin bow , a violin bow you run it across the string and you can sustain that tone and that 's what this does .it sustains a string you ca n't do with a pick , let 's try the two together .( playing )
alright , guys , so now what we 're going to do is , we 're going to do a combo .we 're actually going to put all our shines we 've just learned , and put them all together .technically , this is what we actually want you guys to do eventually .when you 're dancing , you do n't want to just do one shine and then stop .you want to be able to put multiple shines together .so take a look , this is what it should look like .nice and slow , with a basic .five , six , seven .one , two , three , five , six , seven .one , two , suzy-q .one , two , suzy-q .front double cross .triple cross .kick and slide .tap , tap , step .front tap .two , three , five , and stop .let me do if from the back now .with a basic , five , six , seven , basic .one , two , three , five , six , seven .one , three , suzy-q .one , three , suzy-q .front double cross , triple cross .kick and slide .tap , tap , step .front tap , two , three , five , six , seven .
we 're going to go into a wide angle forward bend to stretch the hamstrings , strengthen the leg and get some joint mobility .so we ended up on a forward facing so bring your hands to the chest and push yourself into downward facing dog turning the toes under , coming through hands and knees and lifting the hips to the sky .step the left leg forward to your left hand and then pivot all ten toes. [CLS] [SEP]so they 're facing the side wall to the right .excellent .inhale , extend the spine , soften the heart , bring the weight forward in the bowels of the feet .beautiful .exhale , bend the elbows and draw the chest towards the floor .try not to round the back so much , yes , very nice gentry and then keeping if the hips are coming behind the heels you want to shift that weight forward just enough that you feel some pressure in the ball of your foot .go ahead and wiggle your toes a little bit and then draw the knee cap towards your thigh by increasing the energy in the quadriceps. [CLS] [SEP]so right here you are lifting up .soften the pose just a little bit .there you go .so you can go a little bit deeper .sometimes we hold tension in the legs so hard that we ca n't get a full stretch here .we do want a co-contraction , front and back of the leg equally engaged in this forward bend .that 's nice .deep breaths , open through the heart .if your head is touching the floor you may want to bring the feet in a little bit and then challenge yourself to go a little bit deeper like debbie is doing .awesome .to come out of this pose place the hands on the floor in front of the forehead , just below the forehead , extend the spine , nice .exhale , place the hands on the hips .inhale , come all the way up , squeeze the inner thigh .very strong through the legs .nice. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're done .
so i 'm going to take my rc print. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to tone two prints here today .a fiber print and an rc print .this is my rc print , my plasticy resin coated print .and i 'm going to put it in the ferricyanide first .ferricyanide bleach is going to work on bleaching out the highlights first .look at that ferricyanide go .ferricyanide is an amazing tool to most black and white printers .you can really change the way an image looks .this is n't like clorox or household bleach .do n't decide you 're going to get into this one day and pick up a bottle of bleach .it wo n't work .so the way i do it is just try to see how long that bleach is going in there .there 's no real set time .bleaches really strong like this is. [CLS] [SEP], we just made , it usually takes about a minute , two minutes .and you look it in there .the more you do this , the more you know what to look for .i 'm really looking for all my highlights back here are loosening up .i 'm going to go back to my water over here. [CLS] [SEP], it 's just clear water .you know , i do n't have a sink out here , but you could use this .and i look at this , and i could either bleach this out some more. [CLS] [SEP]or i could put it right back in the sepia .but i think i am going to put it in the sepia .and i should get a nice little brown tone in there .yup , right where that bleach affected it .and again , this is subtle stuff .now it 's a nice little brown in there .
so lets take a minute , to familiarize ourselves , with the equipment that came with our at home drug testing kit and just get an idea of what each piece is supposed to do and the purpose of everything .we 've already seen the at home question and answer , test instruction handbook , which is a , much more in depth piece of text than i have let on so please , always be sure to read instructions thoroughly , when using an at home health product .this is the at home urine collection kit , as you can see it is approximately one-hundred milliliter cylinder and the strip , at the bottom , is very important .this is a temperature strip , and in a freshly produced sample , it will generate a temperature between ninety and one-hundred degrees fahrenheit , representing the fact that the urine has just come from a body of regular temperature .if you were to collect a sample from somebody else who may or may not be messing with a sample , anytime the urine leaves your particular custody , you have no way of knowing if it 's been dumped out or swapped in and commonly people will obtain urine from a person they know , to be absolutely clean and free of any sort of illegal or prescription drugs and try to swap it in , for their own .what this temperature strip will tell you is , whether or not the urine has come fresh from the body or is cold , due to the fact that it has been out of somebody else 's body , for a while .the color green , in the strip , equals that the sample that temperature and if the sample is tan , on the strip , then that means that the sample has dropped below one degree fahrenheit and it could possibly not be your test subjects sample .right here we have the at home test strip .one , two , three , four , five .one is methamphetamine and/or ecstasy , two is amphetamines , three is thc , which is the active ingredient in marijuana , four is cocaine and five is opiates , which are again heroin or any number of prescription pain killing medication .this test is timed , so once it 's dipped , you 'll see that there is a mark to tell you when the result is ready. [CLS] [SEP]and then there is a mark to tell you when the result has expired .should you want to have the further conformation done , on your urine sample , you would then place another sample , into this vile , take this personal identification number for yourself , attach it to the booklet , so you have to call in and identify yourself with the sample .this is an anonymous process , that 's what makes this process anonymous. [CLS] [SEP]is the pin is attached , to the sample itself .check off one , two , three , four or five , what drugs you want the urine screened for , drop it into the bag , follow the little handy check list on shipping conformation , cap it up tightly .you do n't want any urine to get loose , box it up , attach the proper postage and mail it off to the laboratory , for further conformation of drug use or abuse or of no drug use or abuse .
okay , let 's learn a new finger pattern now .we 'll call this finger pattern 2.it 's the first few notes of the minor scale , so we can get into playing that .we 're going to go over the note names , and remember to keep playing with a nice steady tone .on the g string , our pattern is going to be the g , a again , with our first finger , and now we 're going to use our second finger to play b flat .so you hear the difference ; here 's the first pattern , and here 's the second one .one way you can check your pitch on. [CLS] [SEP]that that 's kind of fun ; if you play up and down the pattern you 'll have that little king tut kind of sound , so you can always check your pitch with that .let 's try it , playing four notes on each one ; g , a , say the note names to learn them , b flat , back to a , to the open g.now remember , if you have your tuner , you can keep that handy where you can see it , and that 'll help you to check the pitch , or if you have a friend who has a keyboard , or if you have a casio in the house you can use that to check it , as well .
alright so now we 've got to get back to that japanese tea cup from yesterday .i 'm going to show you how to make a clay chuck , just in case you do n't have the extra two hundred dollars to buy a giffin grip .alright. [CLS] [SEP]so this is what you do , this is the piece of clay that was left over from throwing off the hump , just left it on my clay wheel and decided this would be a good time , since it 's already on there , decided it would be a good time to trim my bowl from yesterday .i took that out earlier today to dry up .so what you want to do is dry this piece out , by drying it out. [CLS] [SEP]i mean rub , rub it down with your rib .i mean not your rib , this potter 's knife .dry it all up , dry up the sides and give it kind of a conical thing going on here .so see what i did there , this is going to allow you to trim something with the mouth , this big or a mouth this big .and that , the angle right there is probably at a good inch difference .so just by looking at my thing i think that 's going to be the proper size .so i 'm going to take it from there .
well now we 're going to bring you to what everybody dreams of becoming. [CLS] [SEP]and that is a model at a live photo shoot .it 's so exciting to be on set and. [CLS] [SEP]here at w we have some great people working for you .joe 's an amazing photographer as you can see and he 's shooting nikki right now. [CLS] [SEP]and this is what we call photo movement .photo movement is actually the lessons of how to work your body and face in front of a camera so that not only do the clothes look great but you look great in the clothes .here we have a prop which we use all the time , a chair , and we have nikki doing the variation of looks that always create what we call an s. [CLS] [SEP]an s is a standard movement that makes everything look beginning , middle and end , just like a storybook .we have joe , who 's an amazing photographer who shoots all of our composites , all of our headshots , and does all of our shoots here at w , working with nikki. [CLS] [SEP]and she 's giving him a lot of look .she 's moving her arms in a way that 's really beautiful , not only for her , but also for the dress she has on , the top she 's got on and also interesting for the camera cause every picture tells a story .right now you see nikki is telling a story with her eyes to camera , with her smile , with her stance. [CLS] [SEP], you see what she 's doing right now ?a little kind of sexy long leg look and also with her propping .joe is doing all kinds of angles because with with every angle he uses , he gets a different look of the same outfit. [CLS] [SEP]so this is part of what we can show you how to do at w , how to become a print model .
you want this to sit in a very relaxed way this is really tight. [CLS] [SEP]you want it to sit nicely around his neck .so i 'm going to loosen this up there. [CLS] [SEP]we go just so it is not pulling to tight on him .again always remembering your keepers .then the next thing you have to do is under the girth and the bottom part is going to come between his legs .the girth is going to slip through the loop on the bottom .you want to make sure as you adjust this that the martingale is even between his two legs not off to the side .we are going to do the girth back up .now when adjusting the standard martingale you want to put first put the nose band through the loop .then reattach the nose band .you know that it fits if when you lift this up. [CLS] [SEP]it comes easily to his throat latch which this one does .if it is to tight like this and it would not go up. [CLS] [SEP]it is going to restrict your horse to much .
and when you do , you take a deep breath in and then tilt your head up. [CLS] [SEP]so the throat goes long and kick out a deep breath , `` haah '' .and then inhale , come in look at your knee , and then tilt your head up and then kick out , `` haah '' .inhale , come in deep , and exhale kick out , `` haah '' .each time deeper and deeper as you reach within with that knee and then lift up , `` haah '' .now one more time with the right side .just bring that knee right in deep and look up and kick out , `` haah '' .and then take the right knee down. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to take the left knee in .each side of the body is different .down towards your left knee , take a deep breath in , look up , tilt the head and kick , `` haah '' .inhale , come in , look at your knee , lift up , kick out , `` haah '' .inhale , come in look at your knee , lift up , kick out , `` haah '' .inhale , come in look at your knee , lift up , kick out , `` haah '' .inhale , come in look at your knee , lift up , kick out , `` haah '' .inhale , come in look at your knee , lift up , kick out , `` haah '' .inhale come in , lift up , kick out , `` haah '' .and one more time , inhale come in and lift up , kick out , `` haah '' .and then release , just straight right up .
alright let 's talk to f major scale .you 're going to be up in the side keys , high , real heavy again just like the last time .starting on f we will just go through the fingerings .it starts off with the low f , g , a , b flat , c , d , e , f , your middle f , f , g , a , b flat , c. [CLS] [SEP]moving up after that d with your side key. [CLS] [SEP]then you go to e and e is played with these two side keys and also this little guy right down here , it is the top side key with the right hand. [CLS] [SEP], that is your e and then to move to an f you play the last side. [CLS] [SEP]key here. [CLS] [SEP]so you have got all three side keys with the insides of your fingers just like that , the octave key and this side key. [CLS] [SEP]and that is your high f.it is actually kind of difficult to play as a beginner .i think i struggled with the high register of the horn a lot .so it is something that you need to practice , do n't get frustrated. [CLS] [SEP]just work it out and. [CLS] [SEP]like we said before you can always start up high just to get yourself up there .so you are really going to need to work the upper register out .we went over the f major scale , let 's play it , here we go two octaves , f major .pretty simple , work that out nice and slow .you can go up in speed nice and slowly but remember to work out that upper register you can use a few keys up top to keep practicing that .there is no need to go up and down on the scale but use your metronome and get it right , okay .
okay , our last cue ball action that we can use in conjunction with the tangent line is backspin .backspin is nothing more than the same spin that we put on the cue ball when we were using a draw shot .but , now on our draw shot , that was when the two balls were lined up straight for a straight in shot , we could get the cue ball to come straight back to us .but what happens when we 're at an angle like this ?we already know that we ca n't get the cue ball to come straight back because of the angle .so , what 's going to happen here. [CLS] [SEP]is we have to look at our tangent line again. [CLS] [SEP], we 're going to identify it as running , pretty much , that direction right there .now , if we have a backspin on the cue ball , what 's going to happen here is , it 's spinning backwards , comes over , hits that contact point , starts out on the tangent line but only follows it for a very short distance , once again .that distance is only about an inch .maybe a little more , maybe a little less , that 's depending on the speed that you hit it with .but , it 'll start out on that. [CLS] [SEP]and it 'll go that direction for a very short distance. [CLS] [SEP], then the backspin will take over , and it will arc back this direction , to the right in this case because our cut shot is to the left .so , a draw shot using backspin would look like this .comes over that way .
i would like to show you a couple of examples real quick of a good corner and a bad corner .a good corner would be when the two edges meet and they line up. [CLS] [SEP]and they are nice and straight and flush .this right here would be an example of a good corner .now i 'm going to demonstrate to you what a bad corner would look like .this right here would be a bad corner and the reason it would be a bad corner. [CLS] [SEP]is because both drywalls from both sides of here do not meet up straight inside here and since it did that there is no meat for this to grab on to right here. [CLS] [SEP]and it just makes it harder for it to set in place .now as long as it is straight which is it , when we installed it we made sure that the corner bead did go on straight .it is still alright .although it would be better if the drywall ran underneath this .now the reason this happened is probably a sheet was cut and put into place and it was just accidentally cut wrong which happens .so we try to avoid that .it is kind of like screwing your screw in too far .we really try to avoid that. [CLS] [SEP]and we try and get all our corners perfect but once in a while when one does happen , if we can still make it look perfect and it will work out then sometimes we just go ahead with it .
hello .i 'm here to tell you how to create a really relaxing atmosphere for your massage therapy clients .now the first thing that you can do is you can set candles up and light them , and dim the lights .this is a really relaxing way to , first of all , just set a relaxing atmosphere .it kind of softens the mood , and helps people really , really relax .the second thing you can do is , of course , to dim the lights and set soft music .now , of course , your choice of music is going to be appropriate for relaxation .you 're not going to set ,like , the ramone 's up , or nirvana , or anything like that .you 're going to set really nice , relaxing music .and you can find any of this type of music in any bookstore , or , of course , used record store .the third thing that you can do is you can use an aroma therapy room spray .now this is one of my favorites .what you like ... [CLS] [SEP]what you can do is just spray the room and let the air settle , and it lets the clients take a really nice , relaxing , deep , and most of all clean breath of air .and this is really important for a massage .the next thing you want to do is , you can either set fountains up with nice , trickling water .it really sounds like they 're outside , and it sets a really nice mood .you can use mirrors , and mirrors are really actually very helpful for people after a massage .and it 's kind of a considerate thing to put in there so that they can check their hair , especially if they 're females and they just got their hair done .they want to make sure that they are not too messed up .and the other thing you can do is just use some nice pictures in your room .and this helps set a really nice atmosphere as well .and of course , your own personal choice .you know , put your own personality in it , but just make sure it 's still simple and sophisticated .so , candles , mirrors , nice music , dim lights , aromatherapy and fountains are a really nice way to set a nice relaxing mood for a massage .i 'm sundae with natural sundae .have a wonderful day .
so you have access to everything here .we 're going to start with the body here. [CLS] [SEP]and you know your guitar will collect a lot of dust even though you 're playing a lot , so you want to get in all the grooves and this will help preserve the body of your guitar , keep the paint good , even though this is an old guitar .i still like to keep it looking good .shine up the pickups , also there are parts that come off here. [CLS] [SEP], you want to take the bridge off here , it will just slide right off .every guitar is a little different , the bridge might be a little different .set that aside !there are these pads underneath that spin , they will raise your bridge up and down , you want to make sure when you 're dusting in between here , if you like the setup of your guitar. [CLS] [SEP]make sure that those do n't spin .you might want to put your fingers on them , to keep those from spinning as your dusting around those .make sure you get in between the volume knobs , something you can also do when your cleaning your guitar is get a can of compressed air and blow underneath these knobs to get some dust out , if you wish .i 'll flip it over and get the back .you also want to do , this is the fretboard here where you put your fingers .i like to clean in between each fret , because as you play you have oils in your fingers and you 're going to build up a lot of crud in there , and while you have the strings off you. [CLS] [SEP]might as well get that stuff off .i 'm going to go in between each set of frets and clean that off .you can see there that we 're getting some dirt off .
the light really effects how visible texture is .so right now you can see i 'm using a very hard light. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's extremely directional. [CLS] [SEP]so there 's just one light pointing very strongly at my little still life here if you will .so you can see the viewer when you take this picture will almost be able to touch the feathers because you can see how soft they are and the wrinkles in this fabric are extremely apparent .as well as this smoothness and the reflections on this ball .now the best time of day to get this is outdoors is when the sun is just first coming up or first coming down cause it 's extremely directional light .now if you want , if you want to do this with a little less contrast , you can flatten the light out a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]but then your subject has to have a little bit more detail .so you can see if i even just kind of move my light away and make it. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's a little bit more diffused. [CLS] [SEP], it effects the quality of the textures especially here in the feathers , you can see it 's not quite as defined .so think about that when you are taking these pictures , especially if you are trying to show pattern or if textures are an important part of the story you are telling with the image .
the next category of herbs were gon na talk about is the aromatics .the aromatics work because they have volatile oils .they have oils that make them hot , make them exciting .capsicum is well known as cayenne pepper , you know you go to the mexican restaurant , and its like. [CLS] [SEP]oh !thats capsicum .ginger , a lot of people think about gingerbread and its all nice and soothing , but if you have ever had real ginger root , it will burn the mouth right off of you .cinnamon , cloves , these are all high in volatile oils .the point of the aromatics is they are hot and dry .what they do is bring energy .they bring energy , vitality and excitement to the body .they open breathing passages , they open veins and arteries .they help blood flow .just think energy , energy .so i have a little bit of capsicum here , and i 'm gon na put just a itty bitty bit in the water here and let my lovely assistant tell me what happens when he drinks it .how does that feel for you ?hot ?ok.how about some of this to counteract it .swish it around a little bit .that will help cool the heat .better ?ok.see how the counteraction goes here ?ok.thats the aromatics .
what we 're going to start with is we 're going to start with square piece of paper , it does n't have to be yellow .you can use whatever you want .and as you can see , i 've already got this pre-creased here .and i 'm going to show you what i did to get it to this point .what you 're going to do is you 're going to start off by folding your paper into thirds .and how you do that is you just bring this side over until this length is equal to this length .now , as you can see mine is just a little bit off .but , that 's fine .fold it this way in thirds .and then once you have your lines there you can just take this side and fold it straight into that line which will give you your third over here .and do the same thing here on your horizontal side .on your horizontal side we 're doing it the same way .now after you have that , you 're going to have this checkerboard shape here .what you 're going to do is you 're going to take your point corners and bring them in to the edge of your line here .you 're going to do that on all four sides , all the way across .and then you 'll have this checkerboard this way .basically , you folded your paper into thirds on your diagonal side .now that you have this , what you 're going to do , is you 're going to take. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to fold over like so ,and you 're just going to open. [CLS] [SEP], it 's almost like an open squash fold is what this is going to be .you 're going to open it up , take it , squash it down like so .you 've got this little off shoot here .what you 're going to do is you 're going to do the same on this side here .just going to bring it up .open squash fold it .like so .now you 've got your two points .now we 're going to do. [CLS] [SEP]is we 're going to take our bottom point .do the same thing here .open it up .and bring it out like so .and then the same thing here .we 're going to come out just open this up a little bit .and bring this .what you 're going to do is you 're going to open it up and bring this across like this on the bottom .then fold it to where it has that boat shape .and then fold it back over .this is it .this is your windmill , or your four pointed star , or your pinwheel , or whatever you want to call it .there it is .my name is robert segundo , and enjoy folding your origami .
the smart tool with the audio is very important .it definitely helps you affect all the audio in the right way. [CLS] [SEP]and you can do a lot of things really quickly .within my audio , i can trim it , very easy as long as i grab it right in the middle of the waveform , i 'm able to trim the waveform pretty easily .if i grab it on the bottom , i can add cross fades .if i grab it at the top , i could grab , i could do regular fades , i could also take this out pretty easily , just by highlighting them and going to edit to way fades .i can also grab it as long as i grab on the bottom half of the waveform , i can grab it and move it .if i grab on top half , this is how it selects certain parts .i could always cut , you know , fade it and move it and trim it with the smart tool pretty quickly , just depending on where i grab the actual waveform .
we have got our lid ready to go so. [CLS] [SEP]let 's get up on it and take a look at it .never cut off more clay than you think you 're going to need. [CLS] [SEP]and you cut at the right angle. [CLS] [SEP]and i like to have an angle like that going that way , watch .since this is wet enough we do n't to stretch and slip it. [CLS] [SEP]but if your clay has dried out a little bit you need to stretch and slip it .so you just kind of bend it into itself right there and then bend it in again. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's what i like .it looks like grandma 's ribbon candy up on there ,just a little doo. [CLS] [SEP]dad like that .you come back and give it some patterns. [CLS] [SEP]like i like to do like eyes or something to look like a snake. [CLS] [SEP]so it looks like it has been buckled on there so there , nice lid .come back and go like this , like that. [CLS] [SEP], now you see what i 'm talking about and see how that 's working with all that there .
and what we are going to demonstrate and talk about is how to clear the obstructed airway .the obstructed airway can be cleared by using the finger sweep technique .before we attempt any type of finger sweep technique we have to determine if the airway is actually obstructed .the first thing we would do is tilt the head using the chin lift technique and try to deliver rescue breathes after we look , listen and feel to determine if the victim is exchanging air .if they are not exchanging air because of an airway obstruction , we would deliver two rescue breaths like forcefully , pinching off the nose and covering the patient 's mouth and blowing air down through the airway .if air will not go through we would reposition the head unless we suspect a spinal cord injury .if there is a spinal cord injury we would leave the head in the position found and use the jaw thrust technique of reaching into the mouth , grabbing under the chin , grabbing the tongue and pulling the jaw and the tongue forward , towards the feet .we would then look inside the airway to see if we see the obstruction and if we see the obstruction , take a finger and do a blind finger sweep through the mouth and the airway to try and eliminate the obstruction .then try and deliver rescue breaths once again .activate the emergency response system and wait for arrival of responding emt 's and paramedics .i 'm captain joe bruni , stay safe and we will see you next time .
we reviewed how to get out of a fire. [CLS] [SEP]but now that you 've gotten out , it 's 2:00 in the morning and your phones are inside .do n't forget having cell phones now days. [CLS] [SEP], you can always make 911 calls from there .some things to keep in mind is yes , most of the time you call 911. [CLS] [SEP]the computer system can tell who is calling .but with now days cell phones , they ca n't tell where you are calling from .make sure if you call 911 from your cell phone that you can give them a direct address so that they send the appropriate people as fast as possible .other important things to keep in mind is perhaps in your inventory list you should keep other important numbers such as the police department , direct line or fire department direct line or emergency contact number .it is recommended now days that you keep one emergency contact number in case that were to happen to you , in your phone list .maybe as an emergency as the heading so that the 911 people can look at your phone and call that number and get any information that you need as quick as possible .
 , we 've beveled the edges of the holes , and we 've hit every surface with the cutting tool , and now for the last step of cutting we 're going to do the edges .and i talked about it before .as you get the polish on , if you have a sharp edge like this , the more you polish , the edge is really going to become actually sharp .you 're going to cut yourself .so what you want to do with the edges is , if you want a smooth edge like this , rather than a rounded edge , you could still do it. [CLS] [SEP]but all you have to do is go along the edge really quick with the cutting tool .and at this point , when you 're doing the edges , you can do shape .if you want this line here a little bit more caved in , you can still just take a little divot down in there at the same time going over the top .and that will make everything all smooth all the way around .if you want it rounded , obviously just round around until you get it. [CLS] [SEP]the roundness you want .i like my edges sharp and flat , so that 's what we 're going to do in the next step .
donna , have you ever worked on a cruise ship ?[ i would love to work on a cruise ship !how do you get hired ?and what are they looking for ? ]well , there 's not a trick to it .i have to tell you , i loved working on a cruise ship .i felt like it was a job. [CLS] [SEP]...well , i did n't feel like it was a job .it was something i did. [CLS] [SEP]and i had to convince myself that it was a job .even though we worked hard , it was easier to work everyday for six months than it is , for me , to work monday through friday , nine-to-five .that 's harder than working on a cruise ship .but people have to know how cruise ships work .in most cases , the ships are registered in other countries .by doing that , they do n't have to hire u.s. [CLS] [SEP]help .they do n't have to follow the u.s. [CLS] [SEP]labor laws .they do n't have to follow minimum wage .so a lot of the jobs , they hire international crews .so if you are interested in working in the dining room or as a cabin steward , often times , they hire international crews that will work thirteen hours a day for maybe one hundred dollars a week .in some cases , and i wo n't mention cruise lines , they even pay to work on the ship .and americans usually wo n't do that .if you are interested in those jobs , you 'll need to work on a few of the u.s. [CLS] [SEP]registered .but some of the other jobs ... [CLS] [SEP]like i started out taking care of the children- a great way to get experience .working as cruise staff , if you have an entertainment background , they like actors , singers ,people who are n't afraid to be in front of groups , people who can do exercise classes , dancing classes .you might want to apply for the cruise ship ... [CLS] [SEP]for the cruise staff .pursers office ; if you 've worked at a hotel , it 's very similar to working at a hotel .it 's the same customer service type skills , the same type of billing with credit cards and such , answering questions ....so. [CLS] [SEP]you might want to work in the purser 's office .shore excursions .are you good with accounting and detail ?shore excursions are the tours they take .thirty-five hundred passengers , they are taking a lot of shore excursions. [CLS] [SEP], you 've got a lot of details if you are good at that .then you might be interested in working in the shore excursion office .if you are interested in the shops , the salon , and the casino , a lot of the cruise lines hire concessions that hire for a number of other lines .so you 'd want to go on their website to see the names of those concessions , so you can apply to them .princess and crystal hire their own people .so , you would go directly to the cruise line for that .captain 's secretary ...do you have good administration skills ?that 's another position that people often forget .so you want to look at a specific job , and what are your talents in that job ?
we 're going to be working on shoulder development as well as some core strength. [CLS] [SEP]so a lot of upper-body work on this one .what we 're going to do -- we 're going to use the bag .we 're going to walk into the bag and , again , we want to have a good wide base outside our shoulders .we 're going to take the bag .we 're going to rotate it around without moving our hips .leaning to the bag slightly , move it around the other way .try to keep the hip squared up .you 'll feel a lot of rotation through here .we 're calling in a lot of obliques ; we 're getting a lot of shoulder work ; we 're getting a lot of stability and control at the shoulder blades .this is a great motion to develop core strength and shoulder strengthening .so again , round , back around and make sure you breathe .
now , how could you possibly teach someone how to make art ?does n't it just spring from the primordial ooze deep in my soul ?no , it 's not true .in fact , there are some techniques that you can learn for how to make great art .most artists want to tell you `` i do n't know how it happened '' because they generally do n't ; they 're incredibly talented and they usually find the intuitive part of their brain to connect with and that , that part of the right brain which never informs us of how we do it ; it just brings out an idea. [CLS] [SEP]and so they go with it. [CLS] [SEP], they hear some leaves rustling across the street and go ( gasp )the leaves rustling inside my soul ; feels like it makes me whole. [CLS] [SEP]and they just go with it right ?and they do n't know what they 're doing ; they do n't know where all those connections come from. [CLS] [SEP]they just do it .however , what they 're doing actually has patterns to it .it actually has things that we can measure ; that we can go and see how to cognitively do what they just magically do all on their own .a lot of times stuff just springs into my mind ; i go with that ,hey man. [CLS] [SEP]if i get a free idea like that woohoo , but if i do n't , then i need to have some ways that i know are guaranteed to help me make good art .i can do it with either side of my brain ; the left or the right side of the brain , the right side is the free and crazy and wild side ; the left side is the planner the orderer , i will make sure that everything fits into a box that makes sense .so let 's learn how to make art .
for this i 'm going to stand up on my toes , if you 're trying to do this move in tap dancing shoes or any kind of dance shoes that are not irish dance shoes , you might want to go out and get a pair of irish dance shoes and come back because for this you need the toe piece to be able to stand on your toes .so what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to stand on my toe and then roll up. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to bring my foot height like this .so the best way to practice this is if you have something to hold on to and to go on your toes and then to roll up .the ultimate move is where you hit the floor hard , you make a sound toe toe .you can either do front back or you can do back front , either way. [CLS] [SEP]it 's good .some people like to do this in combination where you 're doing like toe walk and toe turns and everything .but the basic move is to pull up , you want to do your foot height and do heel toe .
so you are going to start with putting the powdered green tea in to the cup .i am going to put about 3 tablespoons worth in to a small cup .then the next step is to dissolve with a little bit of water .so basically what we are doing , we are actually treating this almost like as at an espresso shot because we are going to be pouring steamed milk in to here .so make sure it is well dissolved .i am going to take my milk and pour into the pitcher .make sure you only put enough milk for what you are going to use .it is really important to actually steam the milk like you are doing a latte .you want it to be really liquidity , do n't want to have it foam up too much .when it gets to the point that it is unbearable to hold with one hand under the pitcher , that is when its reached its optimal temperature .make sure your steamer is clean .then i like to just stir it a little bit more .then we pour slowly into the middle .it is a little bit harder to make art in the matcha green tea latte then with a regular latter but you can defiantly achieve so .there you go .and that ?s a matcha green tea latte .
so if you decided a different seat would work better for you the first step is obviously removing your seat .the seat post that we have on this bike is made by a company names thompson the fairly standard design where you have 2 bolts holding everything on .you can see by changing which bolt is tighter you can change the tilt adjustment .to fully remove the seat what you have to do is unscrew one of these bolts until it is fully undone and you can see that way i could slide a new seat right on without much trouble .the thing to remember when you are taking your seat off. [CLS] [SEP]you know your post is on there. [CLS] [SEP]and you are doing to your bolt. [CLS] [SEP]is try not to loose this little threaded brass piece. [CLS] [SEP]cause it is not at all like anything you are going to find at your local hardware store , it is a odd piece it uses a metric thread , it is very small and the brass that it is made out of actually serves as a barren to help you adjust the tilt .so next we are going to put a seat back on .
so for two inches , you 've got one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine .so that would be nine stitches over two inches .most patterns call for ten centimeters , or four inches .so it would be eighteen stitches to four inches .i like to try to do it a couple times , like measure up here , measure down here in the swatch just to get an accurate representation .and again , what you want to do with your fabric is do n't pull it too tight one way or the other .but it 's best to steam it and pull it. [CLS] [SEP]so it just kind of lays a little bit flat .so it 's not too compressed nor is it too stretched out .just let it kind of hang as it will hang when it 's a finished product. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's on your body .
okay , resources ; what do you need to improve your game ?you 're going to need some tennis balls , you need a racquet , but i think you need a concept of the game .so , trying to find a coach will help .if you 've got somebody in your family like a parent , a brother or a sister to practice with .getting these nerf balls so you can hit against the wall , and also tennis balls and find a good wall to practice against .but when you go on the internet , there 's a lot of great resources and there 's a lot of videos you can watch to watch the great pros technique ; how they do stuff .you want to get fitter .you want to join the usta and get tennis magazine .if you do stuff like that , you 'll start reading and watching and knowing th game better and better .plus you 'll enjoy it more .so , if you ever go to a pro tournament , that 's unbelievable to watch the pros play and practice and of course , there 's a lot of matches on television .so , the most important thing is to just get out and start hitting ; whether it 's drop and hit or whether it 's hitting the wall .try to find a good coach ; somebody that you like working with and then find some other people to practice with. [CLS] [SEP]and i think if you can do all that , your game will once again improve pretty quickly .
alright .now we 're ready for capital letter b where we 're going to talk about date , year , time of day and season .again , go through the script .these are not assumptions .these are specific statements within the script about the year the season the time of day .for example , i have page two .tab over , quotations `` it began one monday last month with hester 's visit . [CLS] [SEP]''ah , ok.one monday last month .now , there may be three .there may be thirty-three and it can vary from section to section here in the environmental factors .the important thing is , that you scour the whole script and find everything .if there 's not but three , that 's ok.if there 's thirty-three , that 's ok too .
hello , my name is hector inga , owner of lane four swim shop in austin texas .i wanted to talk to you about girls ' swim goggles .these are girl specific , speedo makes a junior hydro specs , however they started making them in the pretty color for the girls , like this one is in pink , they also come in the metallic finished lens , also have the junior futurity you see in the coral color , tear has swimple in this pretty color as well , and finesse also makes a goggle with a pink gasket .all these companies found a need to make more feminine colors also for kids , they were making woman goggles so they decided to also get into the arena of the youth girl goggles .and it 's very popular , as you know the female population is the population that spends the most , or likes to go shopping the most. [CLS] [SEP]and this is some of our biggest sellers here at the store .if you need to come and take a look at some of them , we have them available , and we can also fit you .
yeah ,and this is the three dimensional way of doing t-shirts .i 'm gon. [CLS] [SEP]na -- i drew this on a patch .i 'm going to cut this patch off. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'm going to glue or sew this onto the actual t-shirt .this just gives it an extra pop and it adds another color , the color white .you can actually see exactly all the details of making any kind of three dimensional t-shirt on my segment about that .so , but right here we 're going to do it , as i finish drawing , and now i 'm going to cut it. [CLS] [SEP]so i can put this patch on .grace fraga : what shape are you going to cut it ?like just a square ?chantelle tibbs. [CLS] [SEP]: i do n't know .i kinda want it to be circular. [CLS] [SEP]so it looks almost like a cartoon .grace fraga : really ?well , how fun .chantelle tibbs :yeah .grace fraga. [CLS] [SEP]: so you need my help ?chantelle tibbs :no , it 's actually cool .we 're good here .grace fraga :great .chantelle tibbs :but i 'll see whatever shape. [CLS] [SEP]it comes out .i just want it to look kinda comic 'cause there are some comical facial expressions on the characters .grace fraga :yeah , very funny .so now you 're cutting it. [CLS] [SEP]and then you went -- chantelle tibbs :and , again , i did n't. [CLS] [SEP]-- i went big enough , but. [CLS] [SEP]i like --i also like it when people , like , want to read people 's t-shirts. [CLS] [SEP]and they get close to them. [CLS] [SEP], it just causes us to be more , you know , social .grace fraga : get attention , that 's all we want .chantelle tibbs :so yeah .grace fraga : there you go .see , this is an attention getter for sure .chantelle tibbs : uh-huh .grace fraga :so there you finished cutting that patch .and now you 're gon na. [CLS] [SEP]-- the next thing would be to glue it on the t-shirt .so that 's coming up next .
i 'm going to use the gray one because it 's less messy .then i 'm going to put this away .we have here this --let me tell you that this project , it 's really a very good project also to do with the sculpey. [CLS] [SEP]but i do n't have enough material to do the size that i want to do in order to show -- to look good on the show .but with this -- in the way that i 'm going to do it , you can do it at home. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to last quite long because we are going to protect with a special coating. [CLS] [SEP]and you do n't need to put it in the kiln , no .just in the way that i 'm doing it , it will last very , very much .then this plasticine or plastiline , then we are not going to use it. [CLS] [SEP]but also it 's good to make a model and later to make a mold on the figurine .well , then the materials that we have for that particular project is one base that i 'm going to do a little structure , very easy ,just in order to hold the body of the figurine , roller pin , these two pieces of wood , the cutting wire ; some little tools ; and , of course , this in order to cut this -- this is aluminum wire , very , very nice and soft , one screw , and something to work with that , and that 's almost it .let 's start .
what do you need to play baseball ?well , let 's look inside the bat bag and find out .bat bag is the number one thing you 'll find every serious baseball player has .it 's an easy way to get your equipment to and from the game .first thing you need , obviously a baseball .this is a standard baseball .they 're all pretty much the same .you 'll need a glove .gloves come in various sizes .we 'll talk about that a little bit later .this is just a standard outfielder 's glove here .you 'll need some cleats .these will help you to navigate the field of play , help you dig in on the dirt a little bit better so you wo n't slip and slide .these are an optional piece of equipment for your batting gloves .these help you get a better grip on the bat .some people wear them under their fielding glove to add a little bit more padding .they 've got a nice , sticky surface here. [CLS] [SEP]that gives you get a good grip on the bat , helps you swing and control what you 're doing .and then , probably the most important thing , especially for those of us who like the offense of the game of baseball is your bat .this is just a standard aluminum bat .you 'll find this all over the country and various forms of the game .in the major league game , they play with a wooden bat .but this , you 'll find on most other level .and that 's pretty much all you need to play the game baseball .
now , i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]pretty sure you guys know what it is , but i want to go over the specifics of it , okay ?first , we 're going to go ahead and lie down , we got to make sure that we have five points in contact , okay ?both feet , one , two , your hips , three , the small of your back , four , and your head , okay ?so five points in contact with the bench and the floor to begin .and also , when you 're line yourself up. [CLS] [SEP], line your eyes up right underneath the bar. [CLS] [SEP], that 's a good spot .then go ahead -- ryan , bring your hands up .we want to work with a grip that 's just outside your shoulder width , okay .grips will vary , especially the more you progress .but right now , let 's just work with a grip that 's just outside your shoulder width , okay ?ryan , you 're ready for this ?ryan regensburg :yup .mike rosengart :okay , here we go .so ryan 's going ahead and lift the bar up off the rack .he 's going to bring it down to just below his nipples , basically , to the bottom of his heart and then work all the way up with a full extension .as you 're lifting up , try to exhale .as you exhale , it 's going to help give you more power ,okay ?we 're working for ten reps here , okay ?and once we get ten reps , then we 'll see how he feel with the weight and if you can do ten reps quite easily , it 's time to increase the weight .good .and go ahead and take a break for a second .another thing that you can do as a variation , if you do not happen to have a barbell , you can use dumbbells instead , but still , just remember that , when you 're working you want to bring the weights down in line with the bottom of your heart. [CLS] [SEP], okay ?how did that feel , ryan ?ryan regensburg :good .mike rosengart : alright , think you could do more weight ?ryan regensburg. [CLS] [SEP]: i think so .mike rosengart :yeah ,i think so , too .okay , so just remember , five points of contact , bring it down to the bottom of your heart , working for a full extension , okay ?and make sure you have a spotter if you feel that your weight 's getting a bit questionable .okay , so that 's it for this exercise. [CLS] [SEP], we 're going to take a break , grab some water .we 're going to wait about 3 to 5 minutes like we did on the deadlift before we do the next set .
what i am going to show you know is the difference between an in and an out .so were going to take out three pieces .make sure there good and separated and were going to over just as before .just keep going over and make sure we collect all that hair and as you can see with the in braid its rather difficult because you do have. [CLS] [SEP]to constantly just really you have to pick up your hand away from your other hand just a little bit further .to get it out and to get to go down .you just braid all the way down going over the middle on the in braid and for the out braid which is my personal favorite .we go under .and for me this is easier hand positioning because i really do n't move. [CLS] [SEP]i can just move my fingers with out having to move my hands to much .i get my three pieces. [CLS] [SEP]and i prop this up with my thumb. [CLS] [SEP]and i just go under and. [CLS] [SEP]you will see my fingers are really helping guide the hair around these middle pieces .to help it go backwards to help the hair go out and around .that ?s why it ?s called the out braid and the other one is called a in because they face forward and in towards the middle .now that we have these two braids we can compare side to side how they look .the out braid has the hair going in outwards directions as the in has it facing inwards .when it comes to a hanging braid this is more common but in any type of french braid or stylized braid to the scalp. [CLS] [SEP]this is the way that the work generally because it is easier on the hands and a little bit faster to do .
and this is actually a white building .now , how did we create this pink glow ?somebody said to me when the exhibition opened , that i must of used a pink filter .no .this was shot in the middle of the summer , during a thunderstorm .and the thunderstorm had just cleared over the building , and most of the sky was pretty dark .but just as the sun was going below the horizon , it just popped out , hit the underside of cumolonimbus clouds , and reflected onto the building , creating this amazing pink glow .so do n't be scared when the weather is bad to go out and shoot , you might get some amazing results .this photograph was taken with the telephoto lens , actually this lens here , a 100 to 400 cannon image stabilize lens .the essence of this , is that you need to go out during inclement weather conditions to create unusual photographs .do n't be scared to go out when the sun is not out .
now if you 're talking about using a hose end sprayer , well this is one you might try to think about .its got different attachments and you can actually kind of change the dial a little bit to make sure you use different patterns for your plants .you normally do n't want to go in there with a gully washer .you know something that 's going to blow the poor plant out of the container .this happens to be a good one where you 've got an on and off little switch here , so if you have to put the hose down you can .in fact most communities today , if you do n't have some type of an on and off switch well , the water police can sometimes you give you a ticket .so it 's good to make sure you 've got this on and off valve on your hose end sprayer .i know you think if you 've got your hose. [CLS] [SEP]you 're not under the same restrictions that everybody else is .o ' contraire , you need to make sure you follow the rules like everybody else does .also when you 're watering , water what you need to water .do n't water the street , do n't water down across the way , do n't water the neighbor ?s yard .make sure you 're putting it where it needs to be .a good hose and a good sprayer is half the battle in having a good looking plant .on gardening i 'm stan defreitas , mr. [CLS] [SEP]greenthumb .
seated at the desk , just use the spine aligner and roll feet over the ridges , you can also do it standing if you 'd like , but if your balance is n't stepping we recommend you do it seated .this way you 're massaging all of the reflexology points in the bottom of the foot which coincidently also correspond to all of the meridians and organs in the body .every meridian in the body has an ending point on the bottom of the feet , so this way you 've got all of these different points on the bottom of your feet and it feels fantastic .
alright the drink we are about to make is the flaming rasta .so you want to have some reggae music going on in the background while you make this drink or while you drink it. [CLS] [SEP]that 's totally up to you .we are going to do this as a shot and go ahead and chill our first two ingredients .which will be one shot of amaretto and one shot of grenadine there we go .and lets go ahead and shake that up , get it nice and chilled , that will do .and grab your shot glasses go and line them up here .and a strainer and strain what we have so far .and last thing we are going to do. [CLS] [SEP]is add a half of a shot of one fifty one to each of these drinks .light that on fire , grab some friends to watch , make sure you put out the flames before you take it down , bottoms up .
now , let ’ s talk about the hardness of the bullets we are casting .this bullet here was cast with a combination of wheel weights , tin , and antimony .what you can do is get the blend that you need from a commercial source to use with your wheel weights .this will make your bullets harder .this bullet here has more lead content in it .i can tell by being able to scratch the surface of the bullet. [CLS] [SEP]and you can see you where you scratched .in this bullet you can not do that .there is something called a brinell hardness of bullet .this bullet has about a 22 brinell hardness .this bullet here has about 10 hardness on it .this is meant to be driven at lower velocities than this bullet .
in this segment i 'm going to talk about controlling a swing .to swing only as big as you can control .for example , if you were trying to hit a nail into a wall and with a swing or a hit this big , you bent the nail , bent the nail , bent the nail. [CLS] [SEP], what are the chances that you could hit that nail straight in with this swing ?slim to none .you 'd have to be very lucky .and that is the point with the hammer swing .and something that helps tremendously , and that is to swing only as big as you can control .for example , if you could control a swing this big and hit it straight in , and you practice it , then you could get a little bigger and practice it and a little bigger and practice it .but , when you get on the first tee , if you have trouble hitting a nail in at that speed and that length , what are your chances of hitting that nail straight in at this speed and this length ?you have to be lucky .and that 's why you have to be realistic with the hammer swing .so , when you hit and you practice , practice small and hit that nail straight in .practice a little bigger , hit it straight in .but , as soon as you start hitting it crooked and bending that nail , take it down a notch .swing only as big and as hard as you can control .and that 's what 's so great about the hammer swing .it gets you realistic .hit it in little .hit it in a little bigger .hit it in a little bigger .hit it in big , oh , you ca n't hit it straight like that ?take it down a notch .hit the ball straighter .swing within yourself with the hammer swing .
what you use for this game is some kind of soft , cush , caterpillar gummy kind of toy that 's really hard to hurt anybody with , because they 're going to be flying around the room .lots of them are , and something that 's easy to catch .it has a nice sticky texture .so something like this is good .what 's going to happen when you start. [CLS] [SEP]group juggle is you 're going to get everyone in the room in a circle .go over names. [CLS] [SEP]so you make sure everybody knows each other 's names .then one person is going to start .if i was starting , i 'm going to make eye contact with someone else in the circle .see over there ?i 'm going to make eye contact with david .i 'm going to say his name , david .and then i 'm going to gently underhandedly toss him the caterpillar or the ball .once he 's caught it , i 'm going to cross myself off and make a little x in front of myself , because i only want to toss the ball once .and this is going to let people know not to throw it to me again .so once david has it , he 's going to throw it to angela , angela 's going to throw it to steve and so on and. [CLS] [SEP]so forth until everybody 's received the ball once and everybody has crossed out .the very last person , they 're going to throw it back to me , shana , and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to catch it .so that will be our pattern .i 'll remind everybody to remember the person you threw it to because you 're going to continue to throw it to that person .so then what we do is we repeat the pattern , just to make sure we 've got it .i throw it to david , to angela and so on .then what i do is i say , we 're going to try this with more .so we 're going to have four going instead of one , on that same pattern .so we 've got these balls tossing in the air. [CLS] [SEP]and they 're going to sometimes collide with each other , people are going to get stressed out because more is coming down the line .and suddenly things are getting kind of chaotic .once we do that , then i say , o.k. [CLS] [SEP], i 'll take one. [CLS] [SEP]that 's maybe a little bit of a different color or shape than the other ones .and i 'll say , this one is going to go in the reverse direction of the original pattern .so then we try that out .what is it like to go in the reverse pattern ?so angela throws to david , david throws to me and so on and so forth .once we 've got that down , we add these back in .so these three are going forwards in the pattern , this one 's going reverse in the pattern .and what that 's going to do is these guys are going to sometimes go to the same person at the same time .we 're going to have this multitasking situation .and we 're going to see how people deal with that , when this person 's wanting this from them and this person 's wanting that from them , and they 're feeling on the spot and under pressure .once we do a round of those , then i add in a totally different kind of ball like this and these go around the circle .so you have to say the names and toss them around in the circle .so i 've go three of these .so i have three going around the circle , three going in the order .one going in reverse order , and that 's when things are really crazy and chaotic .it 's super fun though when you stop at each round. [CLS] [SEP]and you talk about what 's going on inside your head. [CLS] [SEP], what is this experience like and how can we achieve it better ?people start learning how to slow down , to take care of their partner and connect with them , to make sure they 're ready for whatever ball or whatever idea you 're receiving them .it 's a fun thing to think about .what is this in your group ?is this a client ?is this a concept ?is it a student ?what does it mean for your organization ?and there 's a wonderful debrief or conversation you can have about that activity .make sure to have the debrief and then give people a second chance to try it again , more successfully , and see how the group dynamic changes when people think about making eye contact , slowing down , taking care of each other , making each other look good and working well in the moment .
you will be able to manage your anger better .also , every cell of the body will be oxygenated with oxygen .you will be able to have a calm , cool , collected mind , and anything we do with this state of mind always comes out beautiful .the other plus benefits are , one is less susceptible to coughs , colds , asthma , and even bronchitis by doing the complete yoga breath .also , the additional benefit is both lobes of the brain , that is the right and the left , become balanced .so these are the benefits , now just a line of precaution , only one precaution , breathe through the nose .thank you .
are your wrists killing you at the end of a long day 's work ?maybe you drive a car , grab onto a steering wheel all day .maybe you work at a keyboard all day , cash register .maybe you 're a musician .if so , you might suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome .in carpal tunnel syndrome we 're using our wrist muscles rather than using all the other muscles in our arms , and so all the pressure goes to our wrist .we end up with an inflame medial nerve .one of the things that we can do is to try to stretch and use the other muscles and bring more blood flow into the wrist .so using a simple wrist circle is a great way to bring blood flow into the wrist .if you 're just in a seated comfortable position and bring your arms forward .you want to tuck your thumbs in and then bring the fingers around your thumb .bring your hands together and just begin to circle , keeping the hands together and keeping the elbows straight .do n't bend your elbows and allow your shoulder blades to sink down your back .you 'll also feel this in your shoulders 'cause what we 're trying to do is work our shoulder muscles .as you rotate in one direction , you want to rotate in the other direction .and this is going to stretch the tendons in the forearms and also bring more blood flow for your wrists and hopefully soothe some of your wrist pain .i 'm cindy mastry , namaste .
hello everybody , how are you ?he 's here to join us to help us move it along .well first we 're going to talk about action and movement .now juan as a stuffed figure , he has to animate himself. [CLS] [SEP]so people will believe he 's alive .so how does he do that ?he does that by small gestures and movements that you 'll see in normal everyday people .you know , moving their hand .whether it 's looking around , looking down , fiddling , and looking up , snoring , snoozing , things of this nature .and this again is all contributing to the illusion that the character is actually real .the next thing when juan speaks , he 's always going to lip sync .his mouth is going to match the words coming out .hello , my name is juan pablo .okay , now a lot of times when people will have a puppet for the first time they want to overdo it .so make sure you practice you know , not opening the mouth wide every time .but actually just picking the words you want to emphasize and maybe opening slightly on those and getting into a rhythm .and you 'll know when your character 's believably speaking and when it 's not .so that 's again a thing to practice .the next , we 're going to want to work on your voice to make your character come alive .my character is form south america. [CLS] [SEP]and he talks like this .okay , he 's very proud and he 's very spanish , and he 's very sexy man .so he has a very bravado attitude .so he talks like this .hello , my name is juan pablo francisco montoya .as you can see , he 's a very expressive character .while he does n't have expression in his eyes , immovable eyes and such , his expression comes from his voice and his large movements .thank you again for joining us on expert village .
it is true that japanese people say `` sorry '' a lot .i did it , too .so here are two important words you need to know , especially going to japan .the first word is `` i 'm sorry '' :gomen nasai .repeat after me :gomen nasai .sounds good .be careful with those two `` n '' s right here , try to separate them .the first word `` gomen '' is sorry .and `` nasai '' adds politeness to it .gomen nasai .sounds good .second one is `` excuse me '' .sumimasen .sounds good .now we use `` i 'm sorry '' or `` excuse me '' - gomen nasai , sumimasen - instead of `` thank you '' , because we think the other person did all the trouble for you ; therefore you want to apologize to them .but actually means thank you .for example , you give me a gift , i will say , `` domo sumimasen '' .`` domo '' is `` oh ... [CLS] [SEP]''and ' '' sumimasen '' is `` sorry/excuse me '' .those two words are very reversible .it can be sorry. [CLS] [SEP]/excuse me .so instead of `` thank you '' , you might hear those words .
first you have to decide what you want. [CLS] [SEP]and i decided that i like to put a little bit of ivy on this board to give it just a little bit of umpth something of interest .we have talked about different type of stickers and applicate. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]using a rub on it comes with a stick popsicle stick and. [CLS] [SEP]you actually just rub it on to the item that you are trying to color .make sure that you rub it on every single piece of the colored side it does n't really give a indication if you have or have n't but just make sure that you cover the whole thing with some rubbing so it would transfer this to your board .alright. [CLS] [SEP]so you can see that we have taken just this design. [CLS] [SEP]this is the one want to have right there. [CLS] [SEP]this is where i want it. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]just rubbing until this is being had pressure on it so it would transfer this pattern onto my board .now i 'm going to pull it up just a little bit just to see to make sure i tucked in there which was not a very good thing to do , ops do n't do that there. [CLS] [SEP]alright unstuck .i 'm going to pull this up here and show you what i ended up getting. [CLS] [SEP]and this is actually stuck on here. [CLS] [SEP]this is part of my board now in my next segment what i would show is a little bit more about putting on stickers and applicate to make something more boring look more interesting .
one of my favorite places to see one day when i get the opportunity is the great asian countries .the scenery is just wonderful , especially in shenzhen and guangzhou .if you want to book train travel from this selection , this area of shenzhen to guangzhou the first thing i suggest you do is go through a qualified travel agent .that 's because when you get to asian countries the language is a bit hard to interpret , and if you go through a travel agent you 're likely to get a good deal .although it might be a little more expensive than buying your ticket directly at the counter , once you get to the station , they 'll be able to speak to you in english and give you some good qualified advice on how to do this travel .now , the trip only lasts a little over an hour , but it 's a wonderful trip .when you get to the station follow the english signs .there are english signs everywhere , so that 's going to make things very easy for you .follow the english signs .now , it is suggested that in and around these areas in the train stations that you keep aware of your surroundings , and keep your luggage and handbags very close by , but the best advice i could give you in booking this travel via rail ; it 's a short trip , a fun trip , but definitely go through a qualified travel agent to make sure that you get the most for your money .i 'm russ handler , and that 's how you do it .
ok , so here we have our , our vase , and it has , been on the drying rack for a few days , and as you can see , it 's come off the wheel .so , we know it 's ready to trim .if you had trouble getting it off the wheel , you might want to draw a wire under again , using the same method as we did before .now , the first thing you want to do when you 're trimming , is check , and if you can get your hand in there , check to see how much clay you have on the bottom .so , i 've done that .we have about half an inch .and now , what we 're going to want to do , is prepare a bat , to trim , this part .and , this really is a big time saver , if you ask me .you want to take care of as much of the work as possible .preparation is ninety percent of the game , as , as it always is .and what i like to do is take a pencil and a bat , and draw myself some concentric lines .now , they make different kinds of bats for trimming .you can get bats that have piece of carpet on top , or felt , so that you can put a part on that does n't slip around .they also make what 's called the giffen grip , which has three points that close in on itself .so , another concern when throwing a , a vase like this , is how sturdy your top edge is , because we 're going to be turning it over on to that edge .now , on this one you can see , i have a nice thick , strong , top to it .so , i 'm going to be able to turn this over and simply place it on to the bat .if we had more of a delicate neck , i would want to throw what 's called a chuck , and you can find out more about chucks in other series , in , within other lessons of this series .but first , i 'm going to take my pot here , and turn it over ,and then i 'm going to match it up with those lines. [CLS] [SEP], that i 've put on my bat .and again , this is going to make centering this , a lot easier .and , as you can see i 've lined it up there .and when we turn the wheel on , we have it almost approximately centered .ok , so we have prepared a bat .i 've told you some of the things you need to know about , in order to trim this part .the next thing we are going to do , is center it , on the wheel , and we 'll be doing that next .
now we are going to clean the blinds .this will take you a little longer obviously because you are going to go through every blind individually. [CLS] [SEP]which i wo n't do right now. [CLS] [SEP]but i 'll just talk you through it .now if you have again , if you have wooden shutters you are going to use again your pledge or whichever type of wood moisturizer and shine that you like .but because my blinds are vinyl then again i am just going to rinse out my cloth that i just done my ledge with and use the same cloth to make it easier on yourself .you just want to go from one thing to the next .you want to make cleaning the bathrooms as easy as you can. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm just going to use this damp cloth to dust them .it is going to disinfect them all at the same time and that is all you are doing .you are just going to run along each blind and just rub it a little bit .it depends on how often you clean your blinds as to how hard you need to rub on them. [CLS] [SEP]but you just need to go up and down them and that will take you a good 5 or 10 minutes just to do that one project .
hi !i am from kohinoor club sucundrabad with my team .no i show you the support ribbon .we use a support ribbon to hold the wings , both sides .we start from back wing with the red color .first we have to open this thing .with the red side we marked red side .we lock in the red corner .after that the blue side wing and similar to the red side .now we have to lock this velcro .now it is ready to fly .we have to tie the thread , center , and right corner , this left corner .we have to tie the thread here one , two and three .it looks like this .now three dimensional delta kites is ready .thank you ! !
i 'm going to show you the next segment of this training the palm .first one , low hand hitting .one , two , three .okay. [CLS] [SEP]so that is low hand hitting .let me show it to you again .from here , you want to bring your left leg to your right , you want to open both hands , inhale , then you want to step back , push out hard .okay .next segment , step back ,okay. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to put my hands coming one , two , three , four , five , six , and on the seventh one you want to strike , as if you 're breaking a bricks .okay .then you 're going to continue the same way a repetition on the other side , one , two , three , okay , so when you 're going coming this way you want to inhale , when you 're going this way you want to exhale , one inhale ; exhale , two inhale ; exhale and on the seventh one you want to strike down .okay .and its the closing movement is after this , one , two , and you want to focus , close your eyes , inhale , exhale to your mouth .do this twenty eight , twenty weeks , for forty nine times .and this concludes the training palm exercise of the shaolin training palm classes .
once your child has mastered being able to identify the numbers 1 through 10 , make another chart with the numbers 1 through 20.once they can count 1 through 20 and they can also identify 18 without counting up , then they can start counting things around the house .make counting a lot of fun , take out some beans out of a jar , have them count the beans .take a loaf of bread and let 's count how many slices are in there .take the eggs out , have them count the eggs .have them count how many shirts they own .how many socks , they own .how many people are in their family .how many people are in their play group .they 'll be running around the house , they 'll probably take over before you need to give them much encouragement and they 'll be telling everybody. [CLS] [SEP], daddy guess what ?i have 3 or this. [CLS] [SEP]and i have 20 of that. [CLS] [SEP]and they 'll go up to total strangers and say hey , mr. [CLS] [SEP]how many of this do you have ?but the important thing is to just make it a lot of fun and to say that 's great. [CLS] [SEP], you counted that correctly and just take it from there .
so let 's break down this essay process and let 's start with the introduction .something that you want to do. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's very important for the judges to see. [CLS] [SEP]is to start with a very catchy introduction , something that just automatically catches their attention .and it 's always a good idea to tell a story about yourself .in this particular essay , i 'm going tell you what this young lady put in her introduction .it says , `` i can understand why some youth behave the way they do .i was teased in high school so bad that sometimes i would eat my food in the bathroom .i was anorexic , self-harming and poverty-stricken for a time .this particular young lady 's platform is empowering our youth for a better tomorrow .so what she 's talking about is the struggles that she went through as a young person and how she overcame them through her platform idea .
and she meets on the island of kauia her lover. [CLS] [SEP]and then she ends up going to the big island of hawaii. [CLS] [SEP]and she decide she wants to bring her lover with her .so she sends her sister out to go to the islands to find her lover .the story is , her sister ends up stealing her lover and pele is very angry .there she erupts in a volcanic form and the island which is hawaii that she had settled in , is known as the big island because it 's always growing .so there are hulas about pele and there are cultures about pele where she , you know , travels , sends her sister out , meets her lover and erupts and makes the island grow .
o.k .so now you have your ring on here with your 1 too few knots .so now you 're going to take your two ends that are of the ring , make sure you do n't grab the ends that are from your knots and you 're going to pull them together .you 'll pull one end to take out your slack .if you 've tied , tied your knots too tight. [CLS] [SEP]it 's going to be make , make that a little difficult for you. [CLS] [SEP]but you should be able to do it .so now you 've got this whole bunch of knots together. [CLS] [SEP]but you have a lot of room on your ring with no knots .so you 're just going to go back and kind of space them out .again if this is too , if you 've tied the rings , if you tied the knots really tight you 're not going to be able to make the space .and you might have to go back a couple times to get the spacing right .
using a telescope can be a lot of fun .and , if you get into amateur astronomy in any depth at all , you 'll probably wind up with a pretty big telescope , something eight to ten inches , maybe even larger .they 're getting more affordable , more sophisticated these days .there 's always a time that you 're going to take a trip to the beach , or you 're going to want to do maybe some bird spotting in the backyard , or you just do n't want to lug out the big guy , the big gun .and it 's nice to have a small , portable telescope we call a `` grab and go . [CLS] [SEP]''this is a little eighty millimeter refractor .it 's got a tripod mounting block on the back .i can sit it up on a lightweight photo tripod , bring this up in a minute or two .in fact , i can carry the whole thing in one hand from indoors to outdoors with no problems .it cools down real quick .you can use it immediately , enjoy the night sky , and then go back in the house to hit the world series , if that 's what your heart desires .
i 'm here to answer the question. [CLS] [SEP], how do i find someone by their driver 's license ?well , in many states , you ca n't find someone by their driver 's license , because it 's protected .in fact , there is a federal protection act , known as the driver 's privacy protection act , abbreviated dppa , which protects driver 's licenses , and information about those driver 's licenses , to a large extent .however , if you already have access to that individual 's driving record , you may have the driver 's license information , which you can then put into various databases , to find out whatever information you 're looking for .in other words , you already have the driver 's record legitimately , and therefore , this opens a lot of information to you , to find out about this particular individual .one other possible source , is to hire an outside third party service , to obtain this information for you .i would recommend that a third party service is probably cheaper than a private detective , and you may consider this for the cost .again , i 'm robert todd , and thank you for watching .
i 'm not able to control the orange portal just yet .right now the portal gun i have only shoots out blue portals .i can jump down here and see that there 's really no way for me to get out of this space. [CLS] [SEP]like you would in a normal game .there 's no ladders. [CLS] [SEP], there 's no staircase , there 's nothing like that .in portal you have to come up with clever ways to use the portal gun .i can shoot the blue portal and make an entrance here. [CLS] [SEP]and then i come out the orange portal which is there on the wall .again i can put one here. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'll come out that spot again .so , the early part of the game encourages you to just play around and see what different kinds of fun you can have with the portal gun .now , i need to get over here to the exit where the elevator is and again there 's no way for me to get there by conventional means .and the orange portal is stuck in place , i ca n't move that one .what i have to do now is put my blue portal over here. [CLS] [SEP]and then i can walk into the orange and come out the blue .and that 's chamber 03.off we go to the next one .
we went through the basic butt lift .now we 're going to take that basic butt lift and take it up a notch by adding resistance .the first level of resistance was , remember , gravity .now we 're going to add your level of weight. [CLS] [SEP]so if you 're a beginner , grab a five , intermediate , grab and eight , if you 're advanced , grab a ten .you 're going to place that weight on your hip bones .and if you want to put one hand on the weight , you are more than welcome to .and put one hand on the ground for support .and remember to relax those shoulders .and we 're going to inhale while your body is on the ground , and then we 're going to exhale when we come up on the movement .and remember to squeeze as if you have a penny in between your butt cheeks .and remember that your knee is in line with your hip , and your toes are in line with your knees .so we want to keep a straight line .so let 's do that one more time .so the weight is on our hipbones , safely and securely .and we 're going to raise our bottoms up , squeezing those glutes .and your hamstrings are also working as well .and remember you want to engage your abdominals as well .so we 're going to take that up , exhaling on the movement , and releasing it down .so , inhaling when your body is on the ground .so you 're adding that weight : for beginners , it 's a five .and for beginners , let 's do about twenty to thirty reps.and if you 're intermediate , give me forty to sixty reps. [CLS] [SEP].and if you 're advanced , give me about sixty to eighty .and if you 're really feeling eager and you really want a great butt , give me a hundred for advanced .okay , so that 's the booty-licious , lower , basic workout with weight .
 , you see. [CLS] [SEP]up here there 's dripping that comes down .you want to make sure you get that correct .if you do n't , that will happen .so , if you 're going to repeat the window , wet it down , do it all over again and do it the right way 'cause you do n't want to leave those drippings .you want to clean the window .there 's no need to having the edges clean .it 's tough to clean. [CLS] [SEP]so it looks terrible .here 's another method .you can come across , get to the edge and come down in one stroke .and you see , i 'll do that one more time .i 'm going to come across straight. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'm going to flip the back of the squeegee around and come down , and that just serves the same purpose as the other thing .that 's more of a modern method .i 'm going to clean that edge , but i 'll also make sure it 's clean .get all that .there 's a little bit of drying out here. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm just going to touch that , just a tad bit and. [CLS] [SEP]because it 's so cold outside .generally , in the winter and summer this is definitely rough .we 're going to clean the top edge. [CLS] [SEP]so it does n't drip down , just using the edge in the window .and in the next couple of steps , we 'll have a clean window .
so , once you have a glaze that you are happy with. [CLS] [SEP]and you are ready to make a full-sized batch .i like to make 20-25 ,000 grams usually .in this case , i am going to make 15 ,000 grams because i will have some of the glaze that i am making left over and i will be mixing them together .but first , you want to get a large bucket .this holds ten gallons , which is appropriate for about a 20-25 ,000 gram batch of glaze .so , you want to put about a third of the bucket of water if you are making a full batch .a little bit less if you are making 15 ,000 like i am today .so , that is prepared and that is where we will be transferring the ingredients .now in this case , my gorsley borate for this recipe is 30 percent , so it is going to be 45 ,000 grams .now , i ca n't do that on my small triple beam scale in one measurement , so i have got to split it up .but first of all , when you are doing more than what shows on your balance , you are going to need additional weights .this one is a thousand grams or one kilogram and it just hangs right on the edge. [CLS] [SEP]and i have got another one thousand gram weight. [CLS] [SEP]and i will hang that on the other side .i have still got my 62 and a half on the main part of the balance , so now when i measure this out , it is going to level out at exactly 2 ,000 grams of material .so then i will need another 2 ,500 grams .so , i will do 2 ,000 again. [CLS] [SEP]and then 500.now , when you are having to split ingredients up , it is important to keep a list of how many times you used what amounts of materials so that you are sure you have got the exact amount that the recipe calls for .i have already showed you how to measure , so i am going to go ahead and measure out the ingredients for this recipe. [CLS] [SEP]and then i will show you how to deal with mixing , civing , and hydro metering a large batch of glaze .
prerecording is a very important and very cost saving or cost effective method when you go to record a project .now prerecording essentially means you 're going to record the entire album on your own .you 're probably using a four track or maybe recording into your computer via an inbox or something or on a keyboard .some keyboards like the triton allow you to put drum sounds and add any number of string or horn simulated sounds so that you can hear how this whole album is going to sound in a rough form before you get to the studio .maybe if you do this process and you find. [CLS] [SEP]oh maybe the horn section does n't sound so good on the beginning of this tune. [CLS] [SEP]maybe try a string section instead .mess around with the different possibilities so that when you get to the studio you 're very confident about all your ideas. [CLS] [SEP], how you want the song arranged and where you want these instruments to be .this is also very integral when you 're writing other parts .so you can hear all the parts played together and perhaps the guitar part and the piano part that you wrote do n't really sound too good together. [CLS] [SEP]but they sound good on their own .this way you 'll be able to make that assessment before you get to the very expensive studio .
ranging from about $ 9 you can get them from creativethoughts.net. [CLS] [SEP]and what it would be , is. [CLS] [SEP]it would just take. [CLS] [SEP]i think. [CLS] [SEP]two names and. [CLS] [SEP]it would tell you what they mean .which mine means beautiful meadow , kyle means handsome , erica means honorable ruler. [CLS] [SEP]it would just do different things like that. [CLS] [SEP]and i think there would be poem underneath .it would be just a very nice gift .the reason why this would be a very good gift is because a name is a very personal thing and when you have two peoples names together and the way you can display this certificate it would be in a frame or you can put on the refrigerator just anything you want .so do n't forget to get your boyfriend a personalized name meaning certificate .
in this section , i 'm going to be showing you a basic women 's freestyle ski .there is a difference , so for girls , you want to go out and learn the tricks and learn all the free style moves and stuff .so if you 're a woman freestyle skier and you 're learning freestyle skiing tricks , you definitely want to pick a women 's freestyle ski .these skis are designed for women .there is a difference because the stiffness level , how they 're side cut going down it , the graphics are a lot more feminine. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're definitely just going to want to be on a ski that 's designed for you as opposed to being on a ski that 's designed for a guy who could weigh a lot more than you .they 'll have different strengths and weaknesses and stuff like that .so if you 're a women freestyle skier and you want to keep progressing as a freestyle skier , i would definitely recommend getting a women 's park ski .they 're still going to have the same tail , the same nose .you 're going to be able to do all the tricks .it 's just going to be better designed for a woman .
in winterizing your car , coolant protection is the number one thing you want to be concerned about .protecting your car with antifreeze will raise the boiling point and it will also lower the freezing point in your cooling system .the freezing point is very important in your winter months .a fifty , fifty mix of a good quality antifreeze should bring your freezing point down to minus thirty four degrees .also , antifreeze protection will keep your engine block from rust or scaling as they call it , sending small particles into your radiator which will clog it up .rust can also damage your water pump causing it to leak over a period of time .antifreeze is one of your cheapest ways of protecting your cooling system .
o.k. [CLS] [SEP], so to start with your bag you need some fabric .this is a quilted fabric. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's two sided .sometimes they 're reversible and they have some crazy stuff on one side and something else on the other .this is just solid black .if you 're really rough on your drum or you travel a lot you might want a double layer , you can put like a layer of canvas on the outside or something really thick .this is pretty durable. [CLS] [SEP]but if you 're going to say go to mexico for the winter and drag it on the dirt ; you might want to get something thicker .so just for today we 're going to one layer of fabric .so to start , measure the top of your drum because that 's going to be that biggest part. [CLS] [SEP]so just measure twice cut once they say .so be sure here how big your drum is .you do n't really want to go with the measure of your ring in case. [CLS] [SEP]you measure your ring because if you have fur on the outside of it , you got you 're fingers under there .so we have 53 inches around so that 's going to be the top of our cylinder .so i 'm going to use chalk to mark out the , the fabric .
all right , in this clip we 're going to teach you how to do a backside boardslide .so , this one 's nice and easy ,as you come off the lip of the jump , you 're going to turn your body towards the bottom of the hill , towards the end of the rail .so , when you ollie , you 're going to turn , put your board right in between the bindings over the top of the box of the rail or whatever you 're hitting , keep your knees bent and look to where you want to go and follow it out all the way to the end .now , when you get to the end , you 're going to turn your shoulders and just ride off clean .so , make sure you keep your knees bent .and on this one you want to try -- maybe try it a little bit slower at first , so you can get the feel of the box or the rail or whatever you 're hitting. [CLS] [SEP]and then you can kinda progress up a little bit quicker .so make sure you land flat based , 'cause if you 're leaning too far on your toes , your edge is going to dig into the metal or the plastic or whatever you 're sliding , you 're just going to fall forward .if you lean too far back , you 're just going to slide out on your butt like that .so , make sure you land flat based , keep your knees bent and look to where you want to go .
hi. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm evan from gregg 's cycles and. [CLS] [SEP]today we are going to cover how to remedy a mis-shifting derailer or poorly shifting bicycle .the first thing you want to do is give a general check of your gears , just kind of run through them and see where it 's skipping if it 's skipping at all .it looks like it is not really going around quite all the way there .one of the main reasons that your derailer will mis-shift is due to lack of cable tension .if you can pull your cable down that far the easiest thing to do is just add a little cable tension .the first thing that you can do is use your barrel adjuster which is here on your shifter or many times will be here on your derailer and turning the barrel adjuster clockwise will add cable tension so you can continue to add cable tension until the bicycle shifts appropriately or however you would like it. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'll give that a shot. [CLS] [SEP]and it looks like. [CLS] [SEP]that is a little bit too high now .so you can turn the barrel counterclockwise to release some cable tension and that looks good right there .many times what can also cause a derailer to shift improperly is a bent derailer hanger which we will cover later .again another thing which would cause your derailer to shift improperly would be too short length of cable housing or also too long .if it is way out and curvy and a lot of cable has to pull through there it can get hung up inside there and not shift properly and also if it is too short then the cable will be kind of trying to pull itself out of the derailer because it is so short .another quick fix that you can do is also if your bike is little bit older. [CLS] [SEP]it may or may not have barrel adjusters. [CLS] [SEP]so if you ca n't seem to find one of those either on the handle bar or at the derailer , just take your 5 mm allen. [CLS] [SEP]and you would loosen your derailer cable anchor. [CLS] [SEP]screw there. [CLS] [SEP]and then just pull the cable through taut with your hand and then lock that screw down again and then do the same task , give it a little more or a little less based on how well the bike is shifting .it looks like a little bit too much so give it just a little bit less .great. [CLS] [SEP]that looks good and that is how you adjust an improperly shifting derail .
now , you 're going to put bench on an incline .you want to make sure you have good form .your lower back , your upper back as well flat on the bench .okay ?so , you want to control the dumbbells. [CLS] [SEP]and you want it to be in the hammer position .so , you want to curl it , flex the bicep , bring it down slowly , again , and you want to do about three sets , eight to ten reps.again , coming , bring it down , you definitely want to control the bicep , flexing it when you come up , and then stretch it when you come down .now , you can also switch it up and do the traditional if you want it to .but again , we 're just going to concentrate right on the hammer , if you want it to , you can alternate hammer curls , and you can go back to doing the two , two hands at the same time .so it does , it definitely is your choice , you can switch it up , and that 's how you do the incline hammer bicep curls .
hi , in this clip what we 're going to do is continue with our pencil and start powdering .we already lined amalia 's eyes with the black pencil .that 's really to hold the powder on .with her eyes open and looking straight ahead. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to have her ...just keep looking ahead .i 'm going to mark with my pencil. [CLS] [SEP]how high up a want to blend this .so now i 've marked it .we can go ahead and have her close her eyes .so i know i can blend this pencil all the way up to that area .so use this brush and blend it out .by using the cream , we 're going to allow the powder to set and hold on to the eye a lot better than if we were just going in with the black powder .blend it out a little bit .okay , now we can go and start adding the black powder to amalia 's eyes .the idea with the smoky eye look , or this goth look is to really build .so we 're going to start with this black eyeshadow here and start right on the lash .and since we have that pencil down , it 's really going to hold nicely .lifting it up to that area that i had marked before ...okay , it 's looking good .we 'll continue with the other eye .
alright , we 're going to do another beat. [CLS] [SEP], it 's from a song called `` booty '' by erykah badu .this is of her , l think ,like , 2000 release `` mama 's gun '' .this is somewhat recognizable beat in my kinda r & b world .it 's got ta a lot of space .and it 's a very unique drum beat .so , let me just firstly we play it for you .it 's in 4/4 , and all that stuff. [CLS] [SEP]but you 'll hear what i 'm talking with the space and everything , one , two , three .okay ?so , you can hear if they 're really utilizing all -- just a lot of space .basically , the second bar , it 's almost all rest .okay ?and he does and variations in that. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll kinda talk about a couple of those things and like kind of the couple of different fills that you can do to kinda come out of that second bar and lead back in to that first bar , so take a look .
hello , my name is jesse and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm here today to help you out with what i hope will be an educational and informative and a practical guide to selecting a telescope and explaining the various varieties that are available to you .for instance , you may recognize a typical refracting telescope right next to me here but what about this big fat guy right here. [CLS] [SEP]and what about this little guy that sits on the ground right here .how is an excited , enthusiastic , beginning star gazer come in and start choosing a telescope ?well , that 's what i want to help you out with today. [CLS] [SEP]and i want to do it in a way that cuts through all the technical babble .sometimes i think that confuses more than clarifies .after all , my friend brian is fond of saying that astronomy is much more fun when you 're not an astronomer .however , that being said , there are a few basic things you 're going to need to know about telescopes for this tutorial to be of value .for instance , did you know that magnification is about the least important factor you should consider when purchasing a telescope .we 'll cover that and many other things coming up here in the video .
and i 've fused some transfer paper onto some of my fabric. [CLS] [SEP]and i only did it to whatever size i needed to make the heart .okay. [CLS] [SEP]so we 're just going to go ahead and cut up to the edge. [CLS] [SEP]and now we have our fabric. [CLS] [SEP]and as you can see it 's a little firmer. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to go ahead and put our heart on there .and pin that down .and then we 're going to go ahead and cut it out and your going to use your paper scissors .again do n't use your fabric scissors. [CLS] [SEP]we still have the paper from the transfer paper on here .we 're going to peel it off in a minute but not yet .okay. [CLS] [SEP]so now we 're just going to take our scissors and just cut right around the shape .and i 'm going to turn it toward me. [CLS] [SEP]so i can see what i 'm doing here .you can see that i 'm just going right along the edge .okay. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm just about done here .alright now we take out our pin and take a look and see .that 's a cute little heart , and now we 're going to peel off the back. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to go ahead and fuse it onto the shirt .so i 'll see you at the next clip. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'll show you. [CLS] [SEP]how .
the next type of trail we are going to be talking about is the bunny trail .this is generally where learners first start off , where lessons take place and where people who have just come out of lessons or do n't want to move on to a real trail yet go .you are not going to be using a chair lift most of them use something that looks like an escalator and think of it as a moving sidewalk. [CLS] [SEP]and if they do n't have that and a little bit of a rope tow then you just stand up and hold on to a ring and pull yourself up .as you move beyond the bunny slope you are going to have to start tackling the chair lift. [CLS] [SEP]but right now on the bunny slope you are probably not going to have to deal with that .the bunny slope in tradition is usually the shortest and least steep trail out of all of them completely flat .it is just supposed to help you gain your balance on the board or skis .they do n't want to you know throw you to the wolves and have you on some kind of terrain that you ca n't control yourself on and basically it is just there to help you gain confidence on the board .
the next game we 're going to talk about is the bunny hunt , and the bunny hunt works as follows .one player volunteers to be the bunny , and everyone else are the hunters .now you have two options where the bunny is concerned .you can have all of the hunters have unlimited paint and the bunny can have one hopper full of paint and a shield , and you can have a shield that 's made of a trash can lid or a small piece of plexiglass .just something roughly the diameter of a garbage can lid or option b.you can give the bunny as much paint as he can carry , as much paint as he wants to carry and limit each of the hunter to twenty rounds per hunter , and when the hunter is out of paint then he has to walk off the field .no sharing of ammunition among the hunters .so the game is very simple beyond that .once you 've decided upon the option the bunny will then be given a five minute head start to enter the field .the bunny will take his position up on the field and after five minutes the horn will go off to let the bunny know that the game has begun .then the hunters enter the field and then the objective of the game of course for the hunters is to kill the bunny .the objective of the bunny is simply to survive .
so let me explain scoliosis .there are two parts of scoliosis .all the other ones have a simple curve , either out or in , does n't matter it has a curve .scoliosis has an s and a c curve so your spine is doing some wacky stuff at this time .so regular c curve means that you are kind of pushed in , like one side is dominant and one side is lax .then you have an s curve which means everything here is fine and everything here is fine in a way. [CLS] [SEP]but maybe this side shifts a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]and then this side shifts .you really ca n't tell the s curve unless you favor one side more than the other , the upper side or the lower .the majority of people have an s curve deficiency because one side is more dominant than the other .that comes from when you grow and you do not really treat the curve it is always going to tend to go to one side , the one that is more dominant .we are now going to work on ways to treat the s tendency curve .
here i 'll show you double right stroke on the third stroke .so we have eight strokes altogether alternating hands .right , left , right , left ,right , left , right , left .let 's just put this down first .okay ?now you have four right strokes .on the third let 's go ahead and add a double hitting the drum twice .once we feel comfortable we can go ahead and loop this .and then we can play it faster .
i 've won championships both as a coach and a player .let 's talk about the shooting motion .a really good shooter will tell you that establishing a shooting routine is crucial .what i mean by that is always making sure that your feet are set .always making sure that your feet are pointed towards the basket .having them be no wider than your shoulders .having your knees bent , ready to receive the basketball .when you receive the basketball , being ready to shoot the basketball .it does n't matter if somebody 's running at you , or if you 're wide open .your motion is the same every time , ever time , every time .receive the basketball. [CLS] [SEP], we 've got our feet set. [CLS] [SEP], our shoulders , we 're -- our feet point towards the rim ,our shoulders set for the receipt , we catch the ball , we go up in our range with the ball in our fingertips , not resting on our palm -- on our fingertips .as we release the ball , it comes off of our fingertips , and we always finish high .release the ball , finish high .ball on the tips , release off the tips , finish high .feet set , shoulders set , ball on the tips , finish high .feet set , shoulders set , receive the ball on the fingertips , off the fingertips , finish high .that is the correct shooting motion , and should be done the same way every time , every time , every time .learn how to shoot , become a sharpshooting basketball player .
so let 's just turn it on really quickly .with our vanilla beaten into our cream cheese and butter mixture , we 're going to add two and half cups of powdered sugar .so we just want to scoop this in here carefully so that we 're not spilling powdered sugar everywhere unless you 're going for the snowy look in your kitchen .now , with most icings and frosting , the measurements for the sugar are going to be not terribly exact .because powdered sugar is so very powdered , it can absorb a lot of moisture including from the air. [CLS] [SEP]so the level of humidity is going to affect how much sugar you actually need to add to the butter and cream cheese mixture to get the right consistency .so we 're going to start with the two and a half cups and we 'll see how it goes from there .now that i 've added my two and a half cups of powdered sugar ,i 'm going to slowly start mixing , gradually bringing the speed up as the sugar gets incorporated .with all of our sugar mixed into our cream cheese and butter , this is the nice spreadable consistency that you 'll have with your cream cheese frosting .
okay , let 's talk about a hot tip for dialog processing .now , as we remember we sent all of our dialog tracks to a single bus , right .we took all of our dialogs into the bus one , all of our effects into bus three , four , and music to five and six .let 's go down to that auxiliary bus , okay .i 'm going to be setting up what 's called the dialog chain .now this is one things that some mixers like to keep private or secretive , but this is one of the things i 've learned when i started working with sound mixes in an analog studio , working with film magnetics stock back and forth and. [CLS] [SEP]so forth in the mixing studio .i do the same filtering essentially , and i 've just converted to pro tools .i take all my dialog , send it to a group of plug-ins all chained together .but in this case , i 'm going to put all the plug-ins on one dialog auxiliary .so the first thing i like to do with. [CLS] [SEP]all of my dialog is i like to go through and run it through a equalizer .i 'm going to pick an equalizer , and this case we 'll use a seven band e.q .that 'll work fine , but i 'm only going to use the top and bottom .all dialog needs a little bit of processing and band passing .so what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to put a band pass and take out all the low frequencies that do not belong with dialog .human speech only goes from around one-hundred hertz up to ten , fifteen k , so anything below that is occupied by rumble and wind , all the stuff we do n't want on our dialog tracks .so we take care of that , we put that filter in .and then we , i put a filter on the very , very , very top .this is to get rid of mike noise , hiss , and those sorts of things , back when i was working with sixteen millimeter meg , it used to be just a tape noise .so in this case , i 'm going to be a little more forgiving. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to actually put tha band. [CLS] [SEP]pass up way high. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to put it around fifteen k.so , as you can see here , i have a nice little curve , top and bottom gets rolled off .okay , after that , i gp ahead. [CLS] [SEP]and i put in an equalizer ,i 'm sorry , after the equalizer , i go ahead and put in a compressor .now the compressor is something that , generally when you start with these , they have a built in band pass .look at that , this one has a built in band pass in it .a lot of these compressor come in with nice presets .that 's something you 'll have to find out for yourself .but , basically the way they work is , they will limit the dynamics of the audio .so if somebody gets too loud it keeps it down and that 's a good way of containing your dialog .i like to make sure that the dialog just kisses the compressor , and sometimes you do n't need to put any compression on it at all , and the way we affect that is by the threshold .we want to play our track. [CLS] [SEP]and we want to adjust the threshold so that it 's not actually hitting at all .and that 's an optimal setting right there .so , i 've set it. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's just touching , and that gives us a good setting for our compressor .
to begin , we 're going to look at the different types of writing tools that you might use .you have a choice .easiest , cheapest and most readily available , i hope , are calligraphy markers , which work like so .they have a broad nib and a skinny side .however , as with all things that are cheap and easy to find , the calligraphy nibs eventually soften over time and you 're going to see that your hairlines get thicker and the edges of the nib get kind of squished down .so the alternative is to use a steel nibbed pen .and a steel nib pen is going to give you the beautiful broad lines , just make sure i do n't have too much ink , and also beautiful hairlines and a little more control than the marker .so my recommendation is if you at all can , and sometimes people ca n't manage the pen , i would suggest starting out with a steel nib pen which is the historic tool for writing , for beautiful writing .the nibs come in a variety of sizes .here i have a c0 , which is a big one , and a c1 , which is the next size down .you can see there 's a little bit of difference there .what you want to avoid are the nibs that are pointed because pointed nibs , this nib is not the correct nib to use , will not do the proper writing technique that we 're going to be working on .now here 's another one , a different brand of nib .this one comes from japan , it 's a tape nib .so to start i would say get a large nib and work with that , whether it 's marker or steel nib .
in order to take a chip shot , you want to try and kick the ball over the top of the goal keeper to dip into the goal , so we have to be aware of the goalkeeper 's positioning .when the goalkeeper is not in the goal on his or her goal line , that is a opportunity for use to take a chip shot .the technique behind taking a chip shot. [CLS] [SEP], it involves getting underneath the ball to create loft so that the ball will then come back down and into the back of the net .let 's show that with the demonstrators .our non kicking foot is placed beside the ball , our kicking foot , with the toe down , gets underneath the ball to create the chip that we require , over the goalkeeper and into the goal .that is how we take a chip shot .
it 's a very position race .it 's run two laps around the track .first lap , you usually run between 50 seconds and to 55 seconds for the first lap .this is event more of a combo of speed and an aerobic endurance so most of your energy are geared towards your first lap of the 400 meters .the 800-meter is also a staggered position so meaning the 800-meter will start top of the turn into the first 100 meters .each runner stays in their lane after the first 100 meters , then they break through the other lane .
next i 'm going to show you the slow method of what the hands are doing but forget about the bass drum for now .the best thing to say is the first thing we 're going to do. [CLS] [SEP]is we 're accenting three alternating , three of the same hand. [CLS] [SEP], that 's basically the first thing .then , we switch , we play a non-accent here. [CLS] [SEP]and we switch to two accents on the far hand .then , to get us back to accenting with the left hand , in my case , we 're going to play two accents , so. [CLS] [SEP]what we 've got is ( playing drums ) .to end it we 'll play another left hand accent ( playing drums ) .
okay , prior to doing the actual chains , i just want to point out one more time .i hope i put the information out a little bit earlier .make sure you always check your owner ?s manual and get what the vehicle manufacturer requires for chains .there are some vehicles where they 're not recommended use on , other applications , four wheel drives , where they recommend you have them on all four wheels or not at all .it is a good idea , if you can have chains on your rear , that just gives you that much more breaking and cornering stability .it wo n't help you on acceleration too much on front wheel drive cars but the breaking is dramatically increased .so , that being said , this is standard type s chain and that 's a rating used for automobiles .that basically means it 's requirements , it needs about an inch and a half of over tread clearance and somewhere in the neighborhood of between a half and three quarters of an inch on sidewall clearance .what that means is how much extra space you have to have around the tire to give the chains adequate clearance. [CLS] [SEP]so they wo n't damage the vehicle .we 're well within our parameters here .now we just want to drape that over the tire and get it centered real good .go kind of front to back and all the way around .we 're going to want to make that rear connection first .that 's down around the back side of the tire .to give you a little better idea , we 're going to give you a little different shot of that. [CLS] [SEP]so we can give you a good view. [CLS] [SEP]and i can show you how you can do that with a feel of your hands instead of having to get down there and try to see what you 're doing .if you remember the connection on the inside of this tire chain is just one notch .we do n't have multiple notches to choose from .so i do n't have any tape or any indicator on there. [CLS] [SEP], i only have one option .it 's going to have to be able to be notched .we know it fits correctly , when it 's off the car .so it should fit on there when the vehicle , when the tires mounted back on .so if it 's not going to pull together for you and make a connection .you need to move the snow out of the way or what 's ever impeding the chains ability to come all the way down here to the bottom of the tire .once the rears connected , we just simply make that front connection all the way down to the last notch .then the next step is to put the tensioners on .please watch our next segment ; we 'll cover installing the tensioners .
in restorative yoga , there 's many benefits .not only , we could distress and center yourself more and be able to face your day. [CLS] [SEP], you sleep better and things like that .a great way to find a relaxation is think of several parts of your body .for example , to relax your jaw and these are things to think about as we go to the serious postures later on .relax the jaw , just swallow a few times and let the jaw hang open .at the same time as you start to relax , your cheeks will feel hollow , allow them to feel hollow , jaw 's slightly open .focus on the breath and just let yourself melt into the floor .and these are good indicators to figure out where you are tension-wise .you want your hands to relax , so you do n't want to keep them out too far , you want to have them just nice and relax on the floor as you lay down in these postures that i 'm about to show you .and when you close the eyes , let the eyelids be heavy , let the bottom lid meet the upper lid and let the eyes roll back in the head and find that nice peaceful tranquil feeling of being relax .many people are concern , `` i ca n't relax , i ca n't relax '' .if you focus on trying to find relaxation , you will be frustrated .but if you focus on concentrating on individual body parts , it will help as a whole body relaxation .
we are going to show you again some basic composition ideas for creating chords or chord progression in the key of g flat major .so we are going to stay basically in the key of g flat. [CLS] [SEP]so let 's start right on the key of g flat and go to a flat minor. [CLS] [SEP]it is 2 minor .3 minor and then let 's go into the 6 minor. [CLS] [SEP]and then we are going to do the minor 2 ,5 and go into the major the 1 major g flat major .minor 2 ,5 , 1 major and let 's go to the 4 , get that lydian sound and mix the group 1. [CLS] [SEP]and then you can do 2 ,5 into the minor .those are just some simple ideas for creating some basic chord structures in the key of g flat major .
okay , right now we 're going to talk about white balance .white balance is how you compensate to try to get pure white from different kinds of lighting situations .let 's say for example , that you 're outside in daylight .well , daylight , because it reflects off the sky , is more of a blue type light but if you go into lighting on an interior of a house that 's incandescent lighting , it 's got more of a yellow tone to it , so everything is toned yellow .it 's got , in cameras. [CLS] [SEP]today you 've got automatic white balance. [CLS] [SEP]but you can also adjust it to get perfect balance and custom balance depending on your capabilities .so let 's start out and take a look at this .we 're going to click on this and white balance. [CLS] [SEP]is the first thing that comes up .so you can go into the white balance by going to the right because it shows a little arrow there , and then we 've got. [CLS] [SEP], that 's daylight and it shows you the different colors .right down here , it 's blue. [CLS] [SEP]so it gives you a sort of blue filter effect , when you 're using incandescent and it will do an automatic white balance as well too .but for some people that 's not good enough .you can click on this and go to white balance adjust. [CLS] [SEP]and then you can adjust your white balance , and it shows you what you 're doing to your subject when you do that .you can adjust it in different ways , so it will change your tint and coloration of the while balance .
okay , so that we 've established a safe distance by putting your hands on the shoulders and after we 've established eye contact and let the other actor know what we 're going to do. [CLS] [SEP], now we 're ready to do our punch or our slap and that could be with either hand depending on where you 're audience. [CLS] [SEP]is and we 'll go into that later about positioning .but a few things that you need to know about hitting someone or fake hitting someone ; first of all before you hit anyone ( turn a little bit to the camera shaun )if i was going to punch shaun. [CLS] [SEP]i would not want to punch him like that and stop short of his face .what you actually do is you form a frame around shaun 's head right there or whoever you 're acting with. [CLS] [SEP], you want to for a frame. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to punch outside of that frame or. [CLS] [SEP]you want to slap outside of that frame .you never want to just slap and stop and you always want a good follow through so that the audience knows that you went through with the whole punch or the whole slap .another important thing to know aside from the distance from the person and where around the head you 're going to hit them is that you always want to work slower than you actually would if you 're really hitting somebody .if you 're doing something on stage the audience is there to watch the action not someone really get punched .so you really want to over exaggerate. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to go slower .when you get it all practiced out. [CLS] [SEP]you want to go at the most 75 % of the actual speed. [CLS] [SEP]you would if you were really hitting him .once again when you 're practicing and you 're first learning your moves you always want to start at quarter speed , you want it really slow just so you can get the physical movement down and start memorizing it that way .those are some basic things you need to know about hitting or punching someone .
in this final clip on how to audition for a broadway play , i 'm going to talk about how to keep up your stamina .do n't quit , it 's a hard business , there 's a lot of rejection .it 's not just about how talented you are but luck .do you look the part , do they love you ,are you luck enough to fit in with the other cast members to have the look that the producer 's going for .there 's so many factors that are beyond your control .if you find yourself burning out , you know what ?take a break , take a month off , take a vacation find a side job a side passion .produce your own play , then come back to it do whatever you can to try not to quit .even if it means taking breaks to rejuvenate yourself .do n't go crazy and overboard on it , try and have realistic expectations .remind yourself that it 's beyond your control to a certain extent .if you 're doing everything that i said , if you 're going to your lessons , you 're doing this. [CLS] [SEP]you 're doing that .you have a great look , you 're going as the character , if you 're doing research you 're doing follow up .i mean what more could the world ask of you .give yourself a break , be nice to yourself , surround yourself with good people who encourage you and believe in you and love you .take breaks when you need them. [CLS] [SEP]so you do n't burn out and just keep at. [CLS] [SEP]it do n't quit .
hi , we 're cartooning today .we 're drawing all sorts of animals and now we 're going to keep the story going by adding some things to show what kind of story you are trying to tell with the kind of characters and pictures you are drawing .now this dog all ready looks pretty excited .but how can we tell even more ?well , by drawing a word balloon or a word bubble .just basically a circle with a little thing pointing to his mouth to show where it ?s coming from .this guy could be saying , i want that bone .and that dog is pretty hungry .so , what are we going to do with that dog ?well , i 'm going to make him running towards the bone , and we 're going to draw it right here .oh , that is a scrumptious bone !and he 's running , he 's running. [CLS] [SEP]run run , as fast as he can .but how are we going to show that even more ?well since we 've drawn the body , we 're going to draw these actions lines .more action lines jutting out the back .a puff of smoke .and you know what ?we 're going to draw his tail even bigger .and draw these little quotation lines. [CLS] [SEP]it looks like .and you can tell that is tail is wagging .so now that we 've added object , speech and movement we have a better idea of what these cartoon animals are actually up to .
the g natural minor scale is extracted from the b flat major scale .therefore it has f sharp turning to f natural , e going to e flat , and b going b flat , so we have g , a , b flat , c , d , e flat , f , and g. [CLS] [SEP]quite a difference from the major scale .the g minor scale once again .
willie : hi !my name 's willie .i 'm from carson 's saw shop , here in eugene , oregon , and. [CLS] [SEP]i 've been sharpening tools here for 25 to 30 years. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm here with expert village today .now , i 'll show you hot to dress a wheel here .this is a quarter-inch wheel .i 'm going to put the file in on there there .this is the correct one .this one already has paper on it , so i do n't have to add that .and of course this wheel dresser is real versatile for -- i can cut like -- on this one , i want to cut a 45 degree on this one .also , i can use it on the sides of the wheel to clean those up if i 'm going to use the side , get some new , fresh particles out .and one thing about grinding wheels is they 're pretty safe .
hi , today i 'm going to show you how to play a piece by vivaldi. [CLS] [SEP], okay continued , alright , in a minor .so , let 's play a little bit .( violin demo )so , that 's a little excerpt from the piece we 'll be learning soon to come .
the gouge , the spindle gouge can also be used to make beads on a tool , on your work .one of the things you do to start this off is to take your skew , make two v-cuts at each side .you want to get a little bit of relief in .you then take your spindle gouge , starting at the top in the center , bring it down , raise your handle and twist .if you do n't start with your v-cut on your relief you are not going to be able to rotate to the sides .again bring it around until your top edge of the skew is almost perpendicular .you want to try to do a smooth rotating motion to prevent any type of dimple within the work .you can also typically finish it off on the opposite side by rotating it in to the center .
right now , we 're talking to the soloist , the guitarist .he 's not the lead singer , he 's the guitarist .he has a personality and not all the time -- most of the times , people do n't see it .he 's traveled a long way , he 's toured and everything. [CLS] [SEP]and he gets to this venue. [CLS] [SEP]and then he comes up and just does that .no , alright .so , what we want to talk to you about now is how to project this to the people out there .the first thing you need to do is -- as i said before , who you 're performing to ?sterling :the audience .alex boye :okay , now go and perform to them .okay , stop there .see , again we know that the talent is good but these people -- sterling : go to the audience ?alex boye :these people -- if there 's a way that you can do that , alright , if you 're motivational , speak up , alright .if you talk like this , `` anyway , i 'm going to do this show right now .do you like my jeans ?yeah ,you know what it 's like . [CLS] [SEP]''it does n't do any good for the audience .might do it for a little bit of your ego , but that does n't sell your cds .and so , the key is you want to get out there to the people now .when you play , go like this .i guarantee if you look at one person for long while you 're doing your solo , that guy is going to buy your cds , going to buy your hat. [CLS] [SEP], he 's going to buy your badge , everything you got because you have to own the stage .it is your show ![ indiscernible ] , it 's not about the lead singer ; he 's off there drinking his water .it 's your turn to get up there and give them some serious [ sounds like ] wailing .in england , it means we 're the program , alright ?so anyway , we 're going to come back on the other side .i 'm going to stick with him a little bit more when i talk a little bit more about how to be a soloist when your time comes .so stick around .
observe what their style is .does the teacher inspire child ?does she help them become for confident ?is she encouraging to them even if she knows in her heart that a large percentage of them will not dance as a career , but she can still teach them confidence , elegance , flexibility , discipline , and self-esteem .dance should be a type of stress reliever for a child , as opposed to a new source of tension or frustration .make sure that the teacher is in control of the class and that she 's encouraging to be expressive in their movements , but that 's she 's not condescending in her approach .is she patient ?is he or she a good role model for the children in the classroom and outside of the classroom ?is she knowledgeable in the type of dance that she 's teaching ?the class time should not be chaotic .the teacher should clearly be in charge without having to raise his or her voice .
do you really want to pluck your eyelashes ?this is c.g with lips and more .how do you pluck your eyelashes , if you really want to do that .i do n't recommend it because it 's very painful .but if you have an eyelash that say is real unruly , you could consider using a tweezers .as always make sure your hands are clean before you 're working around your eyes or anybody else 's , but i would n't do this on somebody else .but if you do and it 's really crooked .say you have one right in the middle of the eye. [CLS] [SEP], maybe you ca n't get it curled .very carefully , because your eyes are very very important to us .you could go as close as you can , try to wiggle it around and get it out .i recommend maybe using it or just turning it back initially .see if that helps it .maybe it 'll grow out .because your eyelashes will grow out again and in about four to eight weeks .so if you trim it up that way , lot less painful. [CLS] [SEP]and i think you might be happier than plucking .because if you get in a bad habit of that you 're going to have really sparse spaces on your eyes. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's going to look terrible if you have a bunch of eyelashes missing .so ladies , consider carefully before plucking your eyelashes out .this is c.g . [CLS] [SEP]with lips and more and the greatest gift is the gift of beauty .
you snug the feet in , nice and tight and hold onto the ankles , or the tips of the toes , like what he 's doing and use your elbows to try to press the knees outward and downward , just like that .and his goal is to try to breathe slowly and deeply and through the nose and out through the mouth and that 's sort of a relaxation technique to get the body to sort of loosen up , a little bit .another variation of this , would be for him to slide back and put his lower back against the wall .some people like. [CLS] [SEP], i find that at times , my back can be tight , some people have a harder time doing the stretch , out in the open , so he can sit back , like this and. [CLS] [SEP]the wall does some of the work for him and he can stretch that down to the ground .notice he 's able to get his knee down , just a little bit lower to the ground when he does this .it 's also a great way where , if he wants to actually stretch his hands forward , it actually is a good , sort of , starting position where he can try to get , into that stretch .this next stretch we call a figure four stretch because the body kind of makes the shape of the number four .he 's got one knee that 's bent right here .some people are huge about this knee being flat , some people like it up , that 's a preference thing .basically his head is down , his eyes are closed and he 's relaxed and some people are going to feel this a lot , in the hamstring .some people are going to feel this actually a lot more , in the lower back or potentially in the back hip , right here .notice he 's changing how his hands are .sometimes switching hands , who 's doing a cross hand grab , sometimes he can do both hands , sometimes he can just grab his toe with his finger , just like that but notice each time. [CLS] [SEP], he 's got his eyes closed .now , the eyes closed , that 's a personal preference thing .in yoga , they 're very adamant actually , about keeping your eyes open , most of the time because they feel it puts you more in the here and now .some people , including myself , like to stretch with their eyes closed because it really helps them to withdraw , within themselves , relax a little bit more and kind of gain a little bit more muscular control or relaxing of muscles .you would normally spend a little bit more time , in each stretch .he 's kind of abbreviating them , just a little bit , just to show you some different variations .and again , he 's probably trying to loosen up and stretch out of some of the tight areas like his lower back would be .most important , i notice he 's not intensely pushing , any of these stretches , it 's all about just going to the edge of , where your stretch is , and getting your body to loosen up .he 's doing a lot of switching , to go into a lot of different muscle groups here , now he 's going to bend his leg back , behind him .when you do this , when you get your knee over to the side like this , it now makes the stretch a lot more intense , on your front hamstring .notice he 's going to reach forward , with his hands , his eyes are closed again and there 's varying opinions , as far as this back knee , back here thing .some people , they do n't like it. [CLS] [SEP], they think that it 's hard on the knee , if you do it and your knee hurts , i certainly would suggest shying away from this stretch but. [CLS] [SEP]generally , if you can keep this back part of your leg tucked in behind you , then you 're going to keep from getting any pain , in this knee right here .like with any stretch , if you have any discomfort , make sure you discontinue it , right away .some people get a great stretch out of this one , from this front leg because it definitely makes it very intense , on the hamstring .he 's sinking deeply , into each stretch .switching hands .
ok.now we are actually going to play a note together .when playing the saxophone , you are putting together what i demonstrated in breath control and embouchure at the same time .basically you want a nice tight embouchure .the sides of your mouth have to be tight , keep your cheeks down .do not puff your cheeks and fill the saxophone with air without honking it too hard .it is real easy to do that , especially when you are beginning .the saxophone is louder than it may appear .so just go light on it .and here 's me demonstrating a note up close .if you notice , the corners of my mouth are really tight .my posture , i try to keep it as good as possible and no cheeks puffing .everything sounds good because of that .my embouchure is the most important thing .keep that in mind when you 're playing and let 's practice with your notes .
alright , so here ’ s some good news for you about where to learn more about a svengali deck .a lot of the dealers that will see this will also sell a dvd or a booklet on how to use it , and there 's even some websites .this came with some cards in it that had a website you could go to and learn more about it .if you buy a dvd on this , a lot of times it will even come with a deck .i want to encourage you to read , learn some more ideas , practice with a bunch of different ideas of your own .get used to how the deck works , but do n't be afraid to learn more , combine some ideas , read some books .this one actually came with a booklet of 101 tricks that you could do with it .that just came from a magic shop and they packaged it up standard just like that .there 's all kinds of places to find more info about where you can learn more tricks with the svengali deck .
now from here you want to bring it all in because we 're not ready to go out with that shape yet just by the natural forces of this wheel and the universe. [CLS] [SEP]it is going to want to go like this. [CLS] [SEP]so we just want to start pulling this up , grabbing the clay from the bottom and pinching it. [CLS] [SEP]and while i am pinching it i can feel it raising in my hand. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm even throwing. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm just going out like this , one big throw , no big deal .push down and you always want to push down on this rim. [CLS] [SEP]that 's why i have got this sponge right here and just put it down on there. [CLS] [SEP]and it takes care of it for me , go down there and get rid of any goo and slip this down in there and clean off the sponge and now we 'll get ready for another pull .
what we are going to demonstrate and talk about now is the proper method to secure a tarpaulin or some other type of covering or to secure a rope between two objects called the trucker 's hitch .the trucker 's hitch is basically coming off a substantial object with a piece of rope .the rope would then go around whatever anchor point. [CLS] [SEP]we are going to use and we would come back to the end of the rope and form a figure of eight on a bite around the other end of that rope .once the figure of eight on the bite is formed it gives us a place to run our rope through by placing the rope either through that eye or taking the end of the rope through that eye and pulling it tight .this stretches our rope between our two anchor points , we then take our piece of rope after we get the rope secured and stretched tight and we wrap it around and secure with a clove hitch to finish off the knot .it 's a self tightening knot , it can be slid along , stretched tight and then secured with a clove hitch at the end .simple trucker 's hitch to secure a rope between two objects or stretch a tarpaulin tight .
sitting around and watching television , calling and chatting with friends , all of these things are n't necessarily working towards getting the job done .so , you want to make sure that you regiment yourself with certain disciplines as you 're going through your day-to-day work life .for example , you want to make sure that you 're up at a certain time everyday .you want to make sure that you get showered , get dressed as if you were actually going to a real office .all of these things might seem bizarre at the beginning but they really add up when it comes to sitting down in front of your desk and getting work done .also , you want to make sure that televisions , radios , pdas , anything where you could be -- instant messaging online , distracting websites , can all keep you from actually getting your work done .so , sometimes , working for a certain period of time and then stopping and taking a break can be a good way to reward yourself for completing the task at hand .
so i 'm going to add another glaze to it this time and this time. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to use an ultramarine blue .and i 'm going to mix that ultramarine blue with a little bit of my green. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to go as i said once again and darken the background .it will give it a much richer look to the finish painting , you can see what a difference this makes and how it makes the fish stand out even more .as i said previously be sure and just work in one direction and be sure always to dry in between layers in between glazes and transparencies .( painting )it does n't make any difference if some places the paint is thicker or thinner than others because you want some of the under glaze of the other colors to show through .you want that feeling that you have under water and when i finish this top section i will give you a tip on how to make that happen .just let me get this one little bit here. [CLS] [SEP]done and if i want to have a little lighter section all i do is put my brush in the water and dry it. [CLS] [SEP]and then i can take a little off here. [CLS] [SEP]and i can take a little off here .or i can always go in with the tissue and add more streaks to my under water .stay tuned for our next segment on how to lift off in watercolor .
and what you do is you take a nice inhale and exhale , drop one knee to the mat , bring it down as much as you possibly can , feeling the stretch all along that side .its okay. [CLS] [SEP]if the hip comes off the mat , that 's not the point , inhale that knee up and exhale , the other knee comes down .again , feeling that stretch .as you inhale , you can even increase the stretch on this side .inhale that knee up and exhale , the other one comes down , trying to bring it down just a little bit farther if you can .inhale up and exhale down .
of course , the opposite exercise is also important .i just reversed the weight .so this one weighs less , this one weighs more now .i 'll turn in the other direction , come back , and , again , i 'm going to be leading with my left foot that 's away from the unit .so like this and then with the swing , coming back , forward , swing .with my left arm here that i 'm pulling , upper back .with this , i 'm working my chest primarily and my anterior deltoid , coming across like this .primarily the chest though , with the side , and again working on my balance .
something to remember when you are using warm and cool colors , when you 're mixing them on your color palette , when you mix them together , the warm and cool colors , if you mix cool colors with cool colors and warm colors with warm colors , it 's hard to go around. [CLS] [SEP]but when you start mixing the two together , it 's easy to get muddy colors .muddy colors would be something that would n't really be definable as any certain color .you really want to have colors that are really going to be definable as something you know like a bluish green or a light-pinky purple or something like even if they 're not real words of anything , you want to be able to like have it as like a real color and not like a muddy area on your painting because it does make a difference .like when you 're looking at your composition as a whole , you can spot the places that have the muddy colors and that 's , you really , really want to try and avoid that because it does make a difference so just try and be careful when you are mixing warm and cool colors .
so flowers are another high value crop that we do n't want to ignore in the permaculture garden .flowers not only give beauty , and beautiful odor , they not only attract beneficial insects and bugs , but they also tend to delineate and define the garden .so in other words , we 're going to use these , a gladiola bulbs , the flowers that you often see in funerals and wedding and such , long , spikey , elegant flowers .we 're going to tuck these in the ground , and get rapid results , because we have these very robust little bulbs .in order to grow them quickly , we want to fill a generous supply of well rotted manure in each hole .and then tuck them in , preferably root side down , although they will find their way up , like so .you can see some of the color variation here , that 'll give us lots of interesting permutations .and from there , we merely want to cover them over , with this beautiful rich soil , tuck them in , mulch them in , and then try not to plant over them .remember that we 've planted our bulbs here , and not to double plant .these bulbs should be showing , within two weeks we should see them , and within a month they should be shooting up .that 's just one of many , many perennial flower bulbs that we can incorporate into the perennial garden .
these doggies were actually made by children 7 years and 11 years old .it 's a great project ; it can be made completely by hand .it has only 3 simple pieces in the pattern and it 's made with this nice fleecy fabric that you a lot in fabric stores and. [CLS] [SEP]it does n't have heavy fur. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's very easy to work with .it 's very easy to sew for children .the other things we 'll be using is a number eight in embroidery thread or a thread for doing crochet , 2 colors of embroidery floss .black to do the nose and red to do the little tongue .you only need a little bit .some needles that have a fairly big hole .embroidery needles are good to accommodate the larger threads .some pins are great for holding things in place .a needle threader is good to have , but it 's not necessary and maybe some buttons if you want to do something like this .make a little doggy tag or use buttons for the eyes .you can make it without the buttons by just embroidering the eyes .you should have a good sharp pair of scissors and it 's nice to have a small pair of scissors for doing little trimming threads and small things .then of course you need the stuffing .this is polyfiber fill , 100 % polyester. [CLS] [SEP]and you can find that in craft stores or fabric stores .i think that 's everything .now let 's get started .
today i 'll show you how to make a no-slipping slipcover for any couch or chair .this is a great design , because there 's no constant tucking and fixing of the cover .i 'll show you how to make a fitted cover for the base of the couch .it 's completely fitted on the arms , and throughout the base of the couch .and then i 'll show you how to make cushion covers , and the cushions hold the base cover in place , and there 's no slipping .this cover was made using a regular home sewing machine , and it looks like it was reupholstered .these are the materials we 'll be using for our no-slip slipcover for our couch today .you 'll want to have plenty of pins .we 're going to be using some cording for piping .now if you 're not if you 're not interested in doing the piping , you wo n't need the cording .and there are several different kinds of cording that you can use , and i 'll tell you about that when we do the piping .you may want to use zippers to close the cushions , or you can also use velcro , so you 'll have to decide if you want to use zippers or velcro .you 'll need a seam ripper in case there 's any mistakes .you 'll need a zipper foot if you 're going to be doing piping .if you 're not using the piping you wo n't need the zipper foot .you 'll need a regular either a regular foot , or if your machine has a special foot for dealing with heavier fabrics , you 'll want to make sure you use that .you 'll want to use needles that are for heavy fabric , so check with the instructions on your machine , and see what 's appropriate for that .i 'm using a jeans/denim needle for my machine .you 'll want to have plenty of bobbins loaded , because we 'll be using a lot of thread , and you do n't want to have to stop in between to reload bobbins .you 'll need a tape measure , some good scissors for cutting heavy fabric , plenty of thread for your whole project , and a nice heavy material for the couch cover .you do n't want to use anything light , like cottons or dress fabrics , because the couch , it just gets too much wear and it wo n't last .so , you can use canvases , you can use even outdoor fabrics , or there 's a huge array of upholstery fabric that you can find .okay , i think that 's it. [CLS] [SEP], let 's get started .
when we 've talked about communication , it 's always been from the standpoint of making sure that your team can , can communicate effectively on the field .and we 've talked about verbal codes and there 's a lot of cases where verbal codes are exactly the wrong thing to do .in many cases , especially if you 're stalking an opponent 's position , you may be getting closer and closer to him. [CLS] [SEP]and he still not know that you 're there .you may be trying to get up underneath a bunker and crawl in to a position where you 'll be able to assist another teammate in bunkering that opposing player .so in those cases , it 's critical that you still be able to communicate without giving away your position to the opposing team and. [CLS] [SEP]and and thus opening up yourself for a counter attack .in those cases visual communications become essential .that is why in all of the , in the military , in special forces , delta force , the seals , they have an entire library of these signals and can communicate complex strategy without saying a word .the , learning and employing hand signals is a great way to strengthen your team 's performance on the field .
they also usually have about a 600 denier or less outer layering .so the layering on the outside is about 600 or less , the lining can vary depending on the light weight blanket and the insulation is going to be about 8 ounces or 220 grams or less .that would be considered a lightweight blanket .lightweight blankets are good for mild climates for warm barns or if you do n't care has a little bit of a hair coat , not a long one. [CLS] [SEP]but he 's going to have a little bit a hair coat with a lightweight blanket .lightweight blankets are also really good for spring and fall because the temperature does n't fluctuate so much .so that 's why you would choose a light weight blanket is for a spring or fall environment or a climate that does n't get below 40 degrees .
chinese writing is very different from most other languages in the world .in the chinese writing system , chinese symbols represent each character which corresponds to a single spoken syllable .a majority of words in all modern varieties of chinese require two or more characters to write .many chinese characters were adopted according to their meaning by the japanese and korean languages to represent native words , disregarding pronunciation altogether .chinese characters are also considered to be the world 's longest continuously used writing system .
within our brushes we can change the hardness of our brush actually making our brush a bit softer or a bit harder depending on how we want to paint with it .so if we look at our screen here we can see that i already have a brush selected. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's at a 40 percent , or a 40 pixel here .if i come down here you can see my harness .my harness is set at 100 percent .i can actually , well let 's leave it set at 100 percent first .this is our straight 100 percent line .if i come over here and select this again i can actually bring this down , actually i 'm going to key it in. [CLS] [SEP], i 've already selected , let 's key it in to 50 percent .actually i have keyed in at 40 percent , either way .when i brush it you can see its got this faded edge going onto it .not quite as clear as this one right up here. [CLS] [SEP]and this is really good if you are painting an object. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to get that nice blending around the edges in here .let 's grab another color here .let 's go with blue .we 're going to lay this blue right on top of this gold color we have here. [CLS] [SEP]and as you can see it kind of blends the two together .giving it a softer edge .so if you really want to get into the painting aspect of it .this is a really great brush to use or a great option to use on your brushes and know how to use .another way to change the hardness of your brush is to hold down shift and using the same keys as you used to increase your brush size or decrease your brush size , in your square parentheses , you can actually move it up or down .as you can see it right here my pallet as it gets softer or harder how soft or hard it would be .bring it down .there you go .that 's a very soft , fine , almost airbrush type style .so , remembering your shortcut keys is a great way to change the hardness of it , especially if you are doing a massive painting if you are getting really into the whole classical painting style of it .so play around with it and have fun and enjoy .
when you 're ready to go outside and use our telescope , there are couple of things you should have in order to make your night viewing a better experience .one , is to find a light that is a red light .now , why would you want to use a red light ?well , you 'd want to use a red light because white light destroys your night vision .it takes about five minutes for your night vision to build up .now , this particular light has both the white , if you flip it one way , and the red .so , it 's very handy .so , when you 're at night and you 're out by your telescope , use the red light .you can simply get a flashlight and use red fingernail polish and point over the lens and that works fine as well .the other thing that you should take with you , and this is really a key thing for astronomy , a good binocular .these are 750 's , they 're inexpensive binoculars , good way to get started .you have the ability to see all kinds of incredible things with binoculars .when you use binoculars make sure that you tuck your arms underneath to steady them and then move back .you may want to lean against a tree .but , by taking even the small binocular that we have here and scanning the night sky in the summer , up through the milky way , you 'll see some incredibly galaxies and nebulae and just star clusters that 'll blow your mind .
kneeling with ball support .this is a position that is simple. [CLS] [SEP]but i have to explain it to make sure that you get on it. [CLS] [SEP]right. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're not slipping and sliding all over the place .now what this is going to look like. [CLS] [SEP]is basically you 're going to be wedging the ball .let me show you real quick what this is going to do to do inflections .but to get here if you have a sticky mat that 's ideal. [CLS] [SEP]but now i do n't have one. [CLS] [SEP]but i want to make it work because some of you at home. [CLS] [SEP]or if you 're some place where you do n't have a sticky mat , you may have to work with whatever surface you have , so i wanted to show you that it works , too .now you 're kneeling with your knees underneath your hips and you 're going to wedge .so you 're going to move your hips away to wedge the ball into your thigh .so now i pretty much have the ball secure .i 'm going to bring my outside leg. [CLS] [SEP]so my foot is down on the floor. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'm going to lean on it .now for some of you this is not an easy thing to do .you can go ahead and lean on the ball and grab onto it .or if the ball is the right size , and it should be the right size for you , you should be able to reach to the floor to do any of these exercises .another thing that could happen is the shoulder .so you want to make sure that the shoulder is back .that your chest is facing forward just like i 'm facing you .and the head .a lot of people want to do this because you still want to see straight .you 're not supposed to be seeing straight .you 're supposed to keep the spine aligned continuing with the head .so again , this might be something that you 're either having someone spot you to make sure that you 're doing it right or you want to look at yourself in the mirror .so if you have a laptop put the laptop in front of you and face the mirror. [CLS] [SEP]and you can do it that way .so once you 're in this position , you can either have the arm down towards the floor or you can have the arm on the ball .if you keep watching the series you 're going to see now that we 're going to use this position to do a couple of different ways to do side flexions. [CLS] [SEP]so stay tuned .
hi !my name is lynn loughmiller. [CLS] [SEP]and i have been asked to talk a little bit about budgeting .when i was first married , we started budgeting and it was just a very simple type of budget that we used .we created envelopes and when i got paid , we would cash the check and put money in these separate envelopes .we would pay utility bills and other bills first and money that was left over we would budget into different accounts .the reason i liked this budget so much is that we had budgets for dating and budgets for just our own personal , even if it was only $ 10 , it was nice that i knew that i had $ 10 out of my paycheck to spend on whatever i wanted to .that was kind of fun .we had a budget for dating because we always knew on a monthly or weekly basis there was at least some money we could use to date or do something fun. [CLS] [SEP]and if we did n't have that budget , we would n't have had that extra money because we would have used it for all of these other things where money kind of disappears when you do n't know where your money is .so that was a great introduction to budgets .as i got into the professional world , i started into creating budgets within businesses and it was over a training department. [CLS] [SEP]and we had to create budgets so that we could submit to have money for our year. [CLS] [SEP]and we had to be able to spend within that budget .recently we acquired a few different businesses and in doing that , budgets are critical .they help me sleep better at night .when i am really worried about where our money is going , i look at our budget and compare it to money that is going in and out. [CLS] [SEP]and i look at it .i say , okay , this is how it is doing , this is where we are going. [CLS] [SEP]and i feel better about what is going to be happening as far as the money flowing in and out .it makes a huge difference on just your well-being and knowing that the money is working according to how you hoped it would .so in business it is absolutely critical .if you ca n't use a budget to forecast how the money is coming in , it is going to be spent .
first thing we have to do is wash the potatoes .throw them in a pot of boiling water .to check if they are down. [CLS] [SEP]just poke on of the potatoes. [CLS] [SEP]preferably the largest one. [CLS] [SEP]and if it just falls apart it is done .then drain .notice we would peel the skin off of the potatoes .you can use a graters or a potato masher if you want. [CLS] [SEP]but i though we would go old world and use a fork .then make it into a mountain with a little hole in the middle .
well my first job as a music producer started when i was about 18 years old .now i did n't get paid for it , but i was making beats in the back of a couple of independent documentaries , and independent internet tv shows .so i started making beats , you know putting them in there , then from there when i moved to miami , i started making beats for artists .my first job where i actually got paid was for a wonderful female singer .i had met her actually on myspace , and i played her some of the tracks , they really liked it , and her and her management came in .they paid us , you know a decent sum for three tracks , and they went on her album and it was a really great thing .we had budget , so therefore we were able to bring in. [CLS] [SEP]you know really great musicians , and work with them and the track just came out really amazing .another great opportunity i had to work with an artist was , basically a very young girl. [CLS] [SEP], she was 15 years old .i had met her mother , and her mother said she just really wanted her daughter to get into music , her daughter loves singing .so , you know i brought them into the studio , they sat. [CLS] [SEP], we talked , we you know found out what she was into .and basically started the song from scratch , writing it with her .i actually wrote the song for her as well , she pretty much just sang it .but it was a really great experience working with the mother and the daughter together to put the track out .an entry level position in the music industry would basically pretty much. [CLS] [SEP]be you know going to get coffee at a local studio , getting in. [CLS] [SEP]anyway you really can .whether it 's you know , being a roadie for the band , or whatever you can to just sort of get into the circle of the industry .
i 'm going to show you how to do a roll down the spine from the plough position in modern dance .this is a nice way to release all of the muscles in your back , and to open up your spine .our spine have several vertebra that are stacked on top of each other , and in life we tend to squish those vertebra together .this is a way to open up your spine so that you have a little cushion space in between each vertebra .so i want you to think about that while we 're rolling down the spine .first we 're going to go into your plough position .i 'm going to reach my hands over my head , and i 'm going to reach my feet for my hands .just get into a position that 's comfortable for you .if your feet do n't reach the ground , that 's okay .you can still roll down the spine .it 's important that when we 're in the plough position , we stay there for a couple minutes before we roll down the spine .i 'm not going to stay there for the sake of time , but you should .so once i 've stayed there for a little bit , i 'm going to roll down the spine , and i 'm going to think of reaching each vertebra ,starting from my neck , one at a time , each vertebra is going to reach for the ground , until the very last , my tail bone , reaches the ground .i 'm going to do it as slow as possible. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to control myself as much as possible , and i 'm going to have to use my stomach muscles to do that .if you need to you can use your hands .you can put your hands by your sides to help you .so i 'm going to roll back into the plough position , and i 'm going to hang out here for a while .and once i have , i 'm slowly going to roll down the spine .slowly , reaching one vertebra at a time .if i need to i 'll put my hands down here , but try not to if you can .just relax and use a little bit of your stomach muscles , one at a time , one at a time , one at a time .i can feel each vertebra reaching .i have to remind myself to relax my arms , relax my legs , until i finally feel my tail bone on the ground .and then i 'm going to bend my knees , and just relax and fee all of the muscles in my back just releasing in the ground .that 's a great way to roll down the spine to open up the vertebra in our back and to release the muscles in our back from the plough position in modern dance .
now i 'm going to show you the different types of sugars that are present in different kinds of foods. [CLS] [SEP]and this is really important to keep in mind when you are trying to feed your children food that is going to give them sustained energy , that is not going to give them basically a sugar rush and then a crash .when that happens , you are going to notice that kids are going to get , have impatience , be irritable , they might be tired , generally crabby , not good concentration , moody , that kind of thing .so diet definitely plays a huge part in children 's behavior .what we 're going to look at right here is the first category of sugars , would be the example of a kind that you really want to minimize in your child 's diet .these are the kinds of products that contain sugars of glucose , sucrose , dextrose , granulated sugar , brown sugar .these are the kinds of sugars that are going to basically give a big burst of energy with a crash right after and they 're not something that 's going to give sustained energy , so we really want to use these minimally , these kind of products .as you can see right here , in this product the first ingredient is sugar , which is an indication that it has a lot of sugar in it and that 's the most plentiful ingredient in it .over here we have the sugars that are more naturally derived and that are much healthier to digest .they take longer for the sugar to break down , so the energy is going to be-you 're going to have more energy over a span of time , and these types of sugars are called fructose , which is from fruit and honey or lactose which would be dairy , which would be yogurt and yogurt products .again , the sugar does n't enter the blood stream quite as quickly , more steady source of energy .over here you have the what is considered the more healthy source of sugar ,the complex carbohydrates or we also call them starches .they provide more of a gradual .steady energy and. [CLS] [SEP]they 're going to leave your child feel full longer .you want to go with the whole grain breads , things like unsweetened cereals , pastas , potatoes , that kind of thing .
our next point is a really good point for just general pain .it 's called kunlun mountains or the aspirin point or bladder 60.and it actually is in this space between the achilles tendon and the bone .the particular spot is about two-thirds of the way up , but the easiest thing to do with this area is just to massage up and down in that space between the bone and the tendon .and this will soothe pain just about anywhere in the body .it 's a generalized , as it 's called the aspirin point .so it keeps the energy following , eases the pain , and can be used for any kind of painful condition .it can be used also just as a calming mechanism .it 's a nice point to use if your dog has been traumatized .you just rub in this point and it 's soothing and calming and takes away any pain .and again , it 's an up and down motion in that space between the ankle bone and where this muscle begins up above it .
hi , i 'm joel jones .i own jonesy 's , inc. [CLS] [SEP], a company that specializes in auto restoration and customization .so , now i 'm going to teach you how to determine quickly the level of commitment your vehicle is going to require if you decide to do a restoration .this is a 1956 willys wagon .the previous owner purchased it with every intention of restoring it back to its original state .so , he went out. [CLS] [SEP], he bought it , he took it back to his garage , he started tearing it in in a whirlwind weekend .and all of a sudden , he realized he had completely bitten off way more than he could chew , and so now what ; now what does he do .well , we 're going to use this as a learning experience , to show you kind of the things that you definitely need to look out for ; the big gotchas that are hidden in every single restoration project .obviously , one of the biggest ones that people have a hard time doing is rust repair .rust , rust rust , it 's a four-letter word that plagues this industry , and unfortunately , this vehicle has a lot of rust .it 's not the worst thing about it , but it is definitely one of the biggest problems .some of the telltale signs that rust is being covered up can always be found on floor pans .this floor pan has been repaired pretty poorly .somebody took a galvanized piece of sheet metal , and just riveted it down to the floor , and then sealed it up with some home depot caulking .terrible , terrible re repair , but you ca n't see it if it 's underneath carpet .so , you 've really got to get those coveralls on ; climb underneath of em ' , stab everything you can with a screwdriver to determine how much rust is really in there , because that is the biggest detriment to first time restorers actually having success with their restoration .the other thing you need to keep in mind is you just have to get a feel for the vehicle .this has duct tape holding switches to shifters .it 's got wiring coming hanging down all over the place , and it 's it 's. [CLS] [SEP]it 's just kind of a mess .that 's not to say that this restoration or this project is terrible .it just means that it might require way more than what your facility , your budget , your time commitment is going to be able to allow .this actually ; this vehicle actually has a lot of really , really good , very valuable parts , and in terms of parting it out and mixing and matching pieces from this to another project , it might be the best way to go .so if the price is right and you can buy this vehicle , and you know what parts are good and what parts are bad ahead of time , then you 're going to be a step ahead of about ninety percent of everybody else .for instance , this vehicle has a very rare electric overdrive unit , and it 's the first year of a six-cylinder engine in it , so those two items right there are worth more than what the previous owner paid for the entire vehicle .so keeping that it mind , you may just have to pound the pavement , hit e-bay and wait , join a couple car clubs .then try and find a restoration project that fits what you 're capable of , and what you need to do .
i just ca n't get it .what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to lean on my side over here. [CLS] [SEP]and when i lean on my side over here , i 'm going to go ahead and let this nice fleshy part of the heel slip out. [CLS] [SEP]and then it 'll end up right at the crease of my elbow. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to just let it be there. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'm going to clap my hands again. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to keep my legs where they are while i twist my body the other way. [CLS] [SEP]and there it is , the pressure .now again , i have her like this , right .so , i 'm going to go ahead and loosen up my hands a little bit and let the crease of my elbow catch her heel right here .i 'm going to go ahead and clap my hands and. [CLS] [SEP]while my legs stay where they are , my body is going to twist that way .instant pressure right there .okay , this has been expert village. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to come back and wrap some things up .
sock knitting can appear a little intimidating at the beginning because there are a few steps around the hell area that are a little complicated .but i 've broken up the parts of the sock in this little test sock into different colors to give you an idea of what 's involved .at the top here in purple is a ribbing .you always want to do a ribbing because that will hold your sock up .then you are going to do the leg .you 're going to switch to the leg .and you 'll make that as long or as short as you want .there are people that make socks that are just little like tennis socks , or you can have knee socks .after the sock you are going to go into the heel flap , back here in blue .and there are different ways to knit it to reinforce it so that it 's more durable .after the heel flap you are going to go into turning the heel , which is this green .and there 's your little heel .then you have to work out the gusset to get back to the stitches required for the measurement of your foot .and that 's this white section here .that 's decreasing to get to the size of your foot .then you 're going to want to work the length of your foot .obviously this is a test sock .no ones feet are like this .and in the end you are going to be working the blue portion which is shaping your toe .
a very regular and average , even sort of form , and this would be writing which is orderly and disciplined and efficient , in not only writing , but this is a person who has all those qualities within them .this is the regular type of form , and you can see that it has certain angular and roundedness within it , but it 's not very pronounced one way or the other .that 's why it 's regular .ok ?and now if we come to the rounded type of form , now rounded , that means somebody with a very round , i 'm going to try and attempt to do it for you , now you can see that it 's very rounded .this is a person who can be somewhat conformist perhaps , a little naive .as you can see , this is the rounded form .these people tend to write a little slower also , because they are just putting a lot of effort into it .ok.and now we have what is referred to as angular writing , and that person tends to be analytical , mental , and they have self-will , determination , that 's angular .as you can see , along with that angular , you 've got writing which is a little faster. [CLS] [SEP]and there 's a little bit more pressure on it. [CLS] [SEP]and so we 'll be coming to speed and pressure later .
alright , so we can add a little bit more flavor to the chords that we 're playing .the first thing that i do is instead of playing a g chord , i 'll play a g7 chord .so that 's looking like this : open , open , second fret , first fret .so , c , almost there , back to g7 , and then the break , c , c7 .ok ?go to f. [CLS] [SEP], you can go to f sharp for it to diminished and then go to a.oh , i 'm sorry .f sharp for it to diminished , to c , then to a , then to d , then to g , then c.so after you get to that f sharp fully it to diminished , you go to c. [CLS] [SEP]now. [CLS] [SEP], we went a major , d major , g major , c. [CLS] [SEP]you could also do those dominant .so we have f sharp fully to diminished to c , to a dominant , to d dominant , to g dominant , to c.and you should make it a c major always , unless we 're going to the f chord , which is nice to play the c dominant .
these are the two cymbals that put together your high hat .one is heavier than the other that 's the one you want on the bottom .so that will rest on that little ped that we talked about the other one. [CLS] [SEP]has a little opening that goes over this little rod .that slips onto the rod. [CLS] [SEP]and then it will adjust to the level that is best to get that open and close sound that you always want .once it 's on there you want to make sure they are not touching against that rattle. [CLS] [SEP]so you want it to be above just high enough. [CLS] [SEP]so when you put it down. [CLS] [SEP]it 's a nice type sound .when you release it goes away from the bottom one. [CLS] [SEP]and it does n't rattle. [CLS] [SEP]you wo n't hear any of that .for my taste this should be a little lower which i will adjust a little later on .some people like to be up here playing the drums here. [CLS] [SEP]instead they have it up in a closer fill area when they go to the tom tom 's .
okay the next combination we 're going to discuss. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to elaborate on. [CLS] [SEP]is what we call a left jab , left hook .this combination gives you the element of surprise .it 's a very frustrating punch for your opponent .what happens is you faint the left jab , and as you 're stepping in you come back and throw a good , solid left hook to the head , and then you step back out again .what happens is as you throw that first left jab to the face of your opponent , he 's going to be bringing up his hands ; he 's going to be going onto the defense .all of a sudden , out of nowhere comes a left hook to the side of his head , and he almost looked around as if to say , `` hey is there another boxer in here ? ''or he looks up at the stands to see if his mom just saw him get embarrassed because of a punch that he did n't expect coming from anywhere .normally when you throw the left jab , you bring it straight back .you step back and you bring it straight back to your cheek .you throw the jab and bring it straight back .in this case what we 're going to do is , we 're going to throw the left , and instead of bringing it right back to our cheek , we 're going to continue to slide forward , getting up alongside of our opponent , protecting ourself with our right hand .that 's also important .we 're down in this position anyway , so come out of it with a good left hook to the head , and then step back .okay ?so a little bit faster - left jab , left hook , step back ;left jab , left hook , step back ; left jab , left hook , step back ; left , hook , step back .hopefully you 'll surprise your opponent and frustrate them .there 's nothing like a frustrated boxer , easier to get .
she is suntanned , she is in here .i can just come in .i do n't have to put the color everywhere .but maybe she 's from brazil , but she is very , very tan .brazil or rio de janero .barcelona .then just need to indicate with the color in there .also you only need to use a few colors .i am going to come in with the purple and just bring this jacket to life .i 'm going to just come in here , do this .pow , pow , pow .i do n't have to color everything. [CLS] [SEP]all i got to do is indicate that the jacket is purple .then i am giving it life , and the jacket comes here like this .and so her shoes , her roller skating high heels that are ten inches tall are also purple .maybe , maybe the sun rays are purple on this day .just because it works with the jacket and the roller skating high heels .ok , a purple sun , that 's a new one but not in fashion .so can add color there. [CLS] [SEP]and then i can even go as far as making some of her streaks purple .because it just looks better .and this marker smells like grape also. [CLS] [SEP]so that 's kind of fun .and there you have it .
ok.so , now we 're still doing our moderate walking .and , with that we 're doing cardio bursts .so , this cardio burst is skipping .skipping is so simple , so easy , so fun to do .just like when you were a kid , it 's the basic principal of skipping .so , remember to have fun and remember to breathe .i 'll demonstrate to you how you add in skipping with your walk .and , that 's the way you skip. [CLS] [SEP]and you just add it in with your walk .remember , skip two minutes and do your moderate walk for five minutes .this is a guaranteed way to burn way more calories .
in warrior training , what it does is it develops your resilience spirit .warrior training is not just about the combative martial arts .a real warrior is somebody whose very resilient , who does n't give up .there was an old japanese adage that say , 'if you get knocked down seven times , give up the eighth time '' .that 's what the warrior training is about .it 's similar to yoga and that we use this physical principles , be it kickboxing or jiu jitsu to reach a higher plane .historically , the martial arts was about the spirit and conditioning the spirit through physical body , similar to hatha yoga .so a lot of times in warrior training , we often go back to the meditation , to the physicality and all the different components that comprise warrior training .
alright , this next exercise is called eight up four back .it 's about stop and go , and acceleration .i 'm going to demonstrate it to you right now .you 'll sprint up eight steps and make a hard stop , and then straight into a back peddle for four steps , and then accelerate back up eight more , stop , four more , sprint back out , eight again , and that 's the exercise .okay .you ready ?ready .start back out .up eight , back four .perfect .let 's do it again , one more time .good hard stops , perfect .okay , the benefits of doing that drill is helping you go backwards , helping you go forwards .sometimes you 'll have a quick guard who likes to give it to you like that .you can get it and get it back .
one thing , that i 'd pay attention to , is whether you see a lot of beginner students but hardly any advanced students there .that is a bad sign .that means the retention is not good .for whatever reason , the kids are just not sticking around .they may be quitting because they 're getting hurt and the classes are boring .there could be a multitude of reasons .ideally , they should be constantly learning and having fun .although , they must see progress , they still need to have fun .however , if it is all fun , chances are , they ?re not learning anything .they will not like that , either .on the other hand , if it is no fun and all learning , it will be similar to boot camp .who would want that ?
as we go on to pose number five , once again i want you to point your right toe , pull it into your left foot , which creates the basic , which is our first pose again .but this time , i 'm going to bring my right hand on top of my left bicep , my left hand on top of my right bicep .notice how my fingers in pose number five are upward and relaxed it ?s so important in pose number five that you do not fist up your hands because this is part of the man 's pose and i 'll show that to you another time .it 's also important that you do n't let your fingers be relaxed and lazy .this is a pose that really makes you seem like you have got some business going on .a little bit of attitude. [CLS] [SEP]so we say in the modeling profession .so i want you to keep your fingers relaxed but yet upward on the biceps .also , if you 'll notice , my thumbs are not showing .they 're a little bit hidden and that 's so that the fingers are able to relax on the arm .they 're not hidden behind the bicep .they 're upward and relaxed .i then want to take you from pose number five into pose number six .the only difference in five and six is that the left hand , which i 'm going to wiggle those fingers for you to see , move slowly down below the right elbow .i want you to notice that the only thing that moves here is my left hand rotating under the right elbow .and if it 's touching , slide it away just a little bit .because if you hold the elbow , it almost looks like you 're cold or. [CLS] [SEP]you 're bored or you 're anxious to get away from whatever you 're doing or angry .it creates a totally different attitude than if you 're posing to show that you 're relaxed and feel good in the clothing that you 're wearing .and as i seem parallel against the floor with my arms , i want you to slightly drop the right shoulder .just slightly drop that right shoulder not. [CLS] [SEP]the left shoulder , let it stay relaxed and this is your pose number six .it 's important that if you find yourself holding your elbow , release the elbow , slide down just a little bit so that you still see the right fingers on your right hand over the left bicep .but you also clearly see that your arms are relaxed .like for this sweater that i 'm wearing , it 's the typical pose that you would do in a sweater , so that you can just see it 's restful and cozy to wear this sweater .also , keep the basic the same with the twist in the hip and again occasionally smile into the camera so that you know you 're relaxed and having fun doing pose five and six .
madd is actually a grassroots national organization .we 're based out of irving , texas .we have chapters in each of the states , throughout the united states .madd actually stands for mothers against drunk driving , and we are working in all kinds of communities .we offer school programs ; from kindergarten through college .we work with law enforcement , by providing them with equipment that they can use .we also support them at checkpoints .we have the most comprehensive victims service organization in the united states .we go in and help families , from what we call `` the moment of impact . [CLS] [SEP]''we help them with financial assistance .we help them through the grieving process with counseling services ; as well as court accompaniment .we go in and help them throughout the entire year , and for years and years after .we 've been working with some families for twenty years now .
okay , guys , so on this little tutorial here we 're going to be talking about duplicating a layer .now , we 're going to duplicate the layer because we 're going to want another exact replica of this text that we have here to actually make our reflection .and there 's two way to do it .you can go up to your layers palette , and hit duplicate layer , or if you want the easy way , which i like to do , is shortcuts all the time , you can hit command j or control j on the pc .so as you can see down over here , right when we did that it added two reflections layers , and one of them is a copy layer .what we want to do is we actually want to click and drag this copy layer. [CLS] [SEP]-- we drag it underneath the original .so we want the original on top , and then you want this one on the bottom -- that copy layer .and you can tell it 's a copy layer because it says right there .and we might even want to go ahead and double click on there , and name that -- we 'll name it actual reflection .this is just going to be the reflection layer .and if you can see that i go up here and click on my move tool with the top .now i have a way to move this layer down , and this is the start of our reflection .and this is how you copy a layer to make that reflection , and then on the next tutorial i 'm going to teach you guys how to free transform this to make it look even more realistic .
but if you do not have the right supplies , this will not be a successful experience for you .and i want to show you some of the supplies that you do no need to have .first of all , you need to keep a pair -- a pack of matches with you and this is a great little portable shovel that you should always keep with you and -- if you 're going to build a fire .another important tool is this axe .you ca n't make kindling out of wood if you do n't have an axe and kinda shave down some of this wood which brings me to another thing .you want to have a log or definitely plenty of wood .we 're going to talk about how much wood you should have in order to keep a campfire going .also , again , another source of kindling is newspaper .just dry newspaper .you need a water container to be able to get the fire out in the end. [CLS] [SEP]and then i just keep this pie tin with us so that we can fan the fire .and these are some of the main tools that we really need in order to keep a fire going .
but most of the other vegetables are pretty easily planted .when you get your containers even ones that you have grown from seeds yourself or ones that you have purchased in the garden center. [CLS] [SEP]you want to knock it out of the container , dig your hole , and again you want to be in a nice loose friable soil that is easily dug up like this here. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to plant it back in at soil level .the same level of soil that was in the container should be right where your soil is in your garden .then you want to make sure that you come back maybe mulch in a little bit with the compost , water in deeply even if it is raining you still should go back and water. [CLS] [SEP]it takes those air pockets out from around the roots , it give the plant a good healthy start .if you plant your plants correctly they are going to grow correctly. [CLS] [SEP]and they are going to give you vegetables all summer long .
and i 'm here to answer the question. [CLS] [SEP], how do i report the loss of credit cards and fraud ?well first thing you want to do is you want to be sure and notify immediately the issuer of each credit card .generally , this information was provided you when you were sent the credit card .it 's not usually on the credit card , it would n't do any much good if it was if you 're missing the credit card .so it 's probably advisable when you are issued a credit card to put in a safe place the identity of the issuer of the credit cards that you have that available if and when , your credit card show up missing .the next thing you want to do is if you suspect fraud is to notify the federal trade commission or the ftc .they have a website at www.ftc.gov and a toll free no . [CLS] [SEP]1-877-ftchelp .i 'm robert todd and thank your for watching .
just as you can get a lot of bang for your buck if you can manage to match colors to its similar value , you also can work with juxtaposing colors of similar saturation , and contrasting colors of similar saturation .so what happens in this color study , is that right around the center here , we want our focus .we 've got the most saturation. [CLS] [SEP], i mean that 's definitely the brightest color that 's used .but the blue and the green up here are also quite bright .they 're darker but they are similarly bright .down as we move down this , we stay in the blue-green range , but we 're getting a lot more neutral .as we move down our color is a lot less neutral there than it is up here .and what that does is sort of make it fade away a little bit .so again you know , the more you can control your changes .not just the value , but of saturation , the more you can really control what goes in , what goes out .you know , how much contrast there is .obviously you know , there 's a lot strong contrast here of value .that 's dark , that 's light .up here let 's see .up here it 's more , here it 's more a terms of saturation .that 's a brighter color than this is .also this is warm and this is cool .so essentially , this sits in front of this corner .and that 's how the color theory kind of comes together .warm sticks out , cool recedes .stronger value contrasts jump , lesser value contrasts recede .and in general warm colors come out , cool colors recede and brightness also .the bright colors take your eye more than the dull colors .
what i use is a actually a cloth diaper .this , i 've found really works the best .the important thing is to use a cloth , if you 're using cloth , that is lint free .you can , if you use the wrong kind of cloth , you can really scratch your record and you do n't want to touch it .it 's important. [CLS] [SEP]it 's a cotton based cloth .if you ca n't find , if you ca n't find a cotton diaper , then you really can just use a t-shirt , you can tear up an old shirt and use it .i 've found they do n't work quite as well , because these are nice and thick .but , in the olden days , people actually bought brushes .now , i 've got an old one here , that these work pretty good also for , for spreading the cleaner , and they made specifically for washing .but , you may or may not be able to get your hands on one of these and even though i 've got one of these i still use a cloth diaper .
now , this particular stand has two cymbal stands in one , and this is to alleviate the problem of having two stands ' bottoms running into each other .so it 's just kind of save you some room .so we 're going to set up the ride cymbal portion of this stand right now .so you have to loosen these two guys and spread the legs .it 's nice to get the thigh in there and try to help do some stuff .use all your body parts .and then we just want to make sure this is to the bottom but not touching the ground , and you tighten that and tighten this one .so now , we have -- our base is set .and then i usually slide this underneath the kick drum .now , this is the same thing as the other cymbal stand .we want this leg facing in towards the drum kit .because when we 're hitting the cymbals , we do n't want this to tip over .so that 's in there , nice and sturdy .so let 's go ahead and set up the actual ride cymbal portion .i had to loosen some stuff here .and this is just completely eyeballing it and just getting it close for now .let 's go ahead and loosen the head and get the head to where we think it looks good .and then this stand is unique because it actually pops out of itself and then you put in there .let 's tighten .and i 'm going to adjust this head a little bit .and there is our ride cymbal stand .it 's set up and ready to go .
so also , like other rooms , another thing that i can go ahead and pack that i wo n't be needing in the next two weeks are decorations , which is kind of , could be considered the same thing as knickknacks .in the bedroom , in particular , this means any decorative bedding , so these two big pillows , i might can go ahead and pack .a good way to pack these , again , is in a bigger box because they 're going to be light , and that will also protect them .if i wanted to , since these are silk , i might go ahead and put a plastic bag around each pillow as well , or put them both in one plastic bag if they 'll fit , and then put them in the box just so things wo n't tear anything .if i had any decorative pillows on my bed then i could throw those in there as well , i wo n't be needing those .so any kind of bedding that you can go ahead and pack , you wo n't be having to do that when packing day actually comes around .in addition , any kind of wall decorations , again , making a decision based on how big they are , what they 're made out of , if they roll up , if they have glass , making decisions based on those things about what you 're going to keep on the wall until the last minute or what you 're going to go ahead and pack .i might go ahead and pack this butterfly because it 's just a canvas that i can roll up , i can put it in a poster roll , a cardboard poster roll , and that can be ready to go .the other things on my bedroom wall have glass. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to just go ahead and leave those on the wall so that on moving day i can just take them down , take the nails out , and i can just lay towels in between each of my pictures .
this is voice leading arpeggios example three .so once you 've got one and two down , change it up a little bit more .so we 've got , still on d minor , and now instead of moving to b , we 're going to move to d.that 's the fifth of g 7 , and you go down , five , three , one , seven , and now we 're just move to g. [CLS] [SEP], that 's the five of c and go down , a 7.so it should sound like this .
but , if you scroll up , you 'll see this necklace , again it 's costume jewelry , but it gives out the aura of something fancy and elegant .it does n't look right .it 's chunky , it 's too big and that 's why , it 's right up where my neckline begins .overall it 's not creating a good look .it 's too big. [CLS] [SEP], it 's too bulky , like i said , the neckline , it does n't look great .it would n't work for you. [CLS] [SEP]so stay away from things that are too bulky that hit right along the neckline when you 're wearing a casual outfit .
from this point , so that the edge is folded to follow the outside edge over here and allow this point to come down in the front .i 'm turning the unit over to the front and you can see that the face kind of comes down like that .allow it to come down , flatten and crease .and , then for this point we are going to fold it up inside that flap .because , our cats do n't have such a sharp nose .so , fold it up inside that flap and there you have the face of your cat .now , in the back you have this flap .one of the ears is already in place .take the other flap and fold it to the other side , so that the edge follows along this edge right here .and , you have the ears of your cat .crease that .now , you have the head and the face of your cat already .this will become the tail .what we are going to do , is inside reverse fold this section .and depending on how fat or how skinny or what shape. [CLS] [SEP]you would like your cat. [CLS] [SEP]you would do the inside reverse fold at an angle that you like .so , inside reverse fold that tail. [CLS] [SEP]and then we are going to inside reverse fold again the tail back out the other way .inside reverse fold out .and , you will notice that you will have these little sections down here these little triangles .and , what we are going to do with those triangles. [CLS] [SEP]is just fold them right inside the unit .and , these become like little feet that the cat can stand on .and , with the tail you can play around with it .do outside reverse folds and inside reverse folds .and , you have a curl that tail that curls inside or an outside reverse fold and then another outside reverse fold. [CLS] [SEP]and you have a tail that goes out .or , if you prefer to keep your straight you can keep it that way .and , that is tomoko 's cat .
first thing you need to know is your access code , how to leave the country .for example the united states to call abroad , you need to know 011 , that 's your access code out .you then need to get a country code .in the front of the phonebook , in fact are a list of all the country codes .the uk i happen to know is forty-four , france is thirty-three , china is eighty-six .i happen to call those countries. [CLS] [SEP]so i know those codes .then you need to know the city code. [CLS] [SEP]and then the telephone number that you have to dial .for example , pick up the phone , we 're dialing 011 to get out of the united states , and then we 're going to dial four four to get us into the uk , then we 're going to dial the rest of the phone number , the city code and then the rest of the telephone number to get to my father in law .so remember all of those numbers that you need to make the call successful and effective and it 'll be easy for you to do .kathy pabst robshaw , telephone effectiveness .
the arms that go with that foot pattern , floor , shoulders , floor , back .so you 're reaching towards the floor .you 're not having to touch the floor .but you 're reaching down towards the floor .come up to your shoulders .go down to the floor .and swing them back .just swing them straight back .floor .shoulders .floor .back .floor .shoulders .floor .back .floor .shoulders .floor .back .floor .shoulders .floor and back .notice that my body 's going up and down with the movement of the arms .down , up , down , up .down , up , down , up .down , up .now , let 's see about putting those two things together .step , together , step , back .step , together , step back .the arms go down , shoulders , floor , back .floor , shoulders , floor , back .floor , shoulders , floor , back .
now i 'm going to show you the next section of this form .so one , two , three , four , five .okay .now let me show it to you again .one , left leg forward , right hand .one , two , step back , reach knee , kick .now , cross your arms .your arms should be crossed like this with your right hand in front of your left .turn .hands in .go up .okay now let 's do it again .one , two , three , four , five , six , seven .okay .this concludes this segment .
when you come down to it and you have all your decking and all your beams and everything. [CLS] [SEP]left , it is very tempting just to build a fire in your back yard. [CLS] [SEP]like i 've done , throw on your wood and burn it up .the fire departments will issue permits , you have to call them when you are going to burn .you can burn raw wood but you are not supposed to burn wood that has stain or paint on it .if it is raw it is fine , yes , i 've been caught and they say no paint , no stain the epa does not like that .so what you can do is you can get a small dumpster with the wheels or if you have. [CLS] [SEP]a large project you get a 4 or 6 cubic yard roll up .those are quite expensive. [CLS] [SEP]but if you ca n't burn the stuff because of the stain. [CLS] [SEP]then you need to put it in a dumpster somehow .the prices on the dumpsters and the roll offs vary quite a bit but you can check in the yellow pages , find somebody , find out how much it is and for them to bring one out will cost , to have it hauled away will cost. [CLS] [SEP]and then they charge by the pound. [CLS] [SEP]so they get weighed at the dump. [CLS] [SEP]and then they charge you by the pound .
 , it 's all mixed together .okay ,i 'm just going to stir that. [CLS] [SEP]in ,like so. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're just going to cook the pepper and the onions until they get soft , just a couple of minutes , a few minutes. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to turn my burner down a little bit , i 'm going to cook it just for a few minutes until they get soft. [CLS] [SEP], i can actually smell that. [CLS] [SEP]and it smells amazing. [CLS] [SEP], you can see the rice is definitely browning ,it way past brown actually .your definitely not going to have to do this long because i can already see that the pepper is getting soft here and. [CLS] [SEP]the onions , just give that a stir .okay , i thing we 're good to go. [CLS] [SEP], that was really quick and the pepper is definitely soft , you can see that .okay , wonderful , now i will see you on the next step .
this exercise you will only go as low as you can so beginning ab prep might look like this and coming forward .you want to go as low as you need to , to make the abs engage and then come forward .a more advanced version would be to come all the way down and exhale , pull in the ribcage and come all the way up .now you can add the band and actually the band really facilitates the beginner and it also challenges the arms a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]so you still want to make sure that your arms are pulled back , the shoulders are down , take a nice inhale and exhale , curl down .now for those of you with weak abs it can really help pull you up. [CLS] [SEP]so you have to kind of resist that and come up slowly otherwise. [CLS] [SEP]the band will do the work .
we 're focusing on some footwork right now , we 're going to be working on what 's called chase step .okay , to perform the chase step , i 'll show it to you a few times nice and slow .okay , so this is one of the primary stepping that we do in xing yi .the idea with this is to move forward and to follow up with your body .again , i move forward , follow up .the follow up is important because the follow up , boom , is how we 're generating a lot of force , we 're hitting with our whole body .okay , going the other way for you .as a beginner , you want to kind of come up nice and high , and make sure your weight is on the rear leg , it goes sixty percent , forty percent .okay .and then we step , chase step .chase , step .as you get better with it , you take a bigger step forward and a bigger chase up .your forward foot is striking the ground with your heel .the rear leg is generating force by pushing down and exploding forward .this is how we perform chase step , xing yi beginners .
this is just a cow feeder that we have right here .we put our hay inside and on top here. [CLS] [SEP]i have a grate , and this grate ca n't come off , and the alpacas can get their heads in there and get as much hay out of there as they want .often times you 'll find the alpaca 's heads buried way down in here trying to find any little bit of goody that they can find , little bits of alfalfa , anything that they can find way down at the bottom because they think it 's better .the purpose of the grate is to keep the hay in the feeder .if you did n't have a grate on this , the alpacas would be eating this and just tossing it all over the place .so it keeps the hay in the feeder , and it just serves a great purpose for that .it does n't waste the hay .
one of the most important things once you determine where you want to fish in terms of water body .is to determine where on that water body you want , you want to locate yourself for the day .an easy way to do that is to go to the water body. [CLS] [SEP]look for activity see where anglers are fishing .where there might be bob houses you can talk again to your local tackle shop to local anglers .one of the resources that i like to use is a water body depth map and most of , most state agencies now have these on their web sites .you can download them and print them out and essentially it help you determine what the water depth is in particular areas of the lake and knowing that can help you to target specific species or you know figure out places to fish during time in the year .for example early and late in the season you want target shallower areas say a ten foot flat adjacent to a deeper water .twenty or thirty foot area a lot of times during midwinter your pan fish such as perch and blue gills .will be found in deeper. [CLS] [SEP], deeper holes say twenty to thirty feet. [CLS] [SEP]so you can find one of those located next to shallow water .that 's a really good place to , to try .
rokosz , your digital lifestyle expert , here with some advice on how to buy a tv .now , this is an exciting time .it 's time for a new television set .where do i go ?well , the first thing that you have to ask yourself is : `` what 's my budget ? ''now , some advice -- if you look at things like your automobile , you may pay a few hundred dollars a month on that , and you 'll use it for a few years , and you use it maybe half an hour or an hour to work and back .but your average television set , you can use anywhere from three to ...well , if your day 's off , from eight to ten hours a day .if you 're using it to watch ... [CLS] [SEP]use it to watch your computer or play video games and things like that .so maybe something that you invest a little bit in , but whatever your personal budget will determine which direction to go , all right ?because monitors , your television sets , will go from anywhere from a few hundred dollars , well , up to 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 thousand dollars , depending on your needs .all right , the other thing you have to ask yourself is : where is the television going ?you may want 100-inch projection tv , but if you 're living in a one-bedroom apartment , that 's just not a reality. [CLS] [SEP], okay ?so how far am i going to be sitting away from it ?the trick is , if you 're sitting closer to the television , you can buy a smaller monitor and have it appear like a larger monitor .i ... [CLS] [SEP]and from there , your primary use .am i going to be using it to ... [CLS] [SEP]for watching movies , broadcast television , play video games ?each one of those will lead you down and narrow the selection .your basic selections are this : whether you want to go standard definition or sd tv , or high definition or hd tv .and then from there , if you want high definition , which i highly recommend , you 've got to decide whether you want an lcd television , like the one that i 'm standing next to , a dlp or a digital light projection television , or a plasma ,all right ?and each of them have better uses .some of them are better in high light situations like the lcd , some are better for playing video games like the dlp , all right ?plasma and dlp being the highest , and you 're going to pay the highest price .there 's also rear projection televisions , which i like a lot .you can get yourself a very large television in rear projection in high definition and save a few dollars .so remember , how much do i have to spend ?what am i using it ?where is it going from ?with a little bit of research and kicking some tires ...no , do n't .do n't kick the monitors , but you know what i mean .do some window shopping and a little bit more research , and you 'll find the best tv monitor for you .i 'm rokosz , your digital lifestyle expert , saying , `` stream you later . [CLS] [SEP]''
in this clip we 're going to talk about the proper method for `` rainxing '' the outside of your windshield and the inside as well .once you have the exterior glass clean and dry , what you 're going to do is take your rain x bottle and shake it really well .what that 's going to do is disperse all the additives and sealers into the fluid mix .what we 're going to do from here , once we 're shaken. [CLS] [SEP]our rain x solution , is apply it carefully to a cloth .if you can see , it 's kind of runny .once you have it on the cloth , we 're going to take and apply it to the windshield in a small circular pattern .alright .we 're going to continue with our circular pattern until we 've covered the entire exterior surface of the windshield .if necessary , you can re-apply some to your washcloth .as you can see a haze has developed on the windshield .that 's exactly what we 're looking for and indicates the appropriate time to begin buffing the haze off .so what we 're going to do , just take and polish it until the haze on the entire surface of the windshield is gone .
our website is www.martialartsnc.com .this clip will demonstrate the basic front , diagonal , and horizontal sword cuts .starting with the tip of the sword pointing at the space between the eyes .use the bottom hand to push up , the top hand right beneath the sudo , or guard , is the guide hand .as you move forward , same hand same foot , cut down the center .do not allow the sword to drift .again , pushing and letting the weight of the sword do the cut .diagonal cut .starting again .push the sword up and slightly off the side , cut diagonal .push up , come to the side , diagonal cut .horizontal cut .starting with the cut to the left hand side , push the sword to the side and let your top hand remain somewhat loose in order to guide it .cut horizontally , turning from the waist .turn the blade over , and cut horizontally in the other direction .
now in this clip we 're going to talk about eq which stands for equalization and tone .these essentially affect the color of the sound when you 're playing through an amplifier .there are adjustments on the guitar that will change your tone and your eq as well but let 's talk specifically about the ones on the amplifier .now first is treble , treble woofer is to the high sound , the high frequencies .so when you adjust the treble you 're adjusting how much of that high bright sound you want so let 's take a look at that .if we turn , start with the treble all the way down and then turn it all the way up. [CLS] [SEP]you can see there 's a much crisper brighter sound .all the way down , all the way up , now mid is somewhere in between there .these would be the mid tones. [CLS] [SEP]again it 's a , a frequency range. [CLS] [SEP]so let 's try mids all the way down and mids all the way up .this is a little bit more in the vocal range , the mid tones and all the way down and all the way up .so it 's a little more subtle. [CLS] [SEP]but it definitely makes a difference and then bass which is the very low frequencies .let 's try bass all the way down , very thin sound , bass all the way up a little bit more robust .
it 's all about where the body is .we talked about. [CLS] [SEP]we do the hands and how it has the motion in it. [CLS] [SEP], we talked about how we do the feet and step now the main part of this dance is the hip movements .make sure you turn your body left and right make sure it bends , so in these couple of clips right here you see how your body bends left and right. [CLS] [SEP]and how you can be able to do this with a little funk a little twist .so once you put all that together you got like the sickest cabbage patch dance ever so check out this couple of clips right here , this is how you can be able to move you body .
now i 'll be discussing zils .now , earlier we used the word zils to describe the two metal parts on a tambourine that vibrate against each other , so here , just a set of zils would be on a tambourine .now , zils more generally would refer to what you would know as finger cymbals .now , these are from india , but you 'll see them in in different countries in the middle east .now the idea between these two instruments is to vibrate against each other .you 'll see this in tibet even , in religious ceremonies , where you 'll hit two cymbals , and the slight difference in tone between the two cymbals creates oscillation , basically meaning it 's slightly out of tune from one another to create a vibration sound .now , they can also be used for dancers , so like belly dancers , for example , would use these instruments , but they would keep them on one hand ; they might even have a pair of them like you saw in castanets , where they have one hand and the other hand creating different rhythms as they dance .
it 's all mixed in together in the key of e [ playing guitar ] .and you could actually walk bass lines as a bass player doing this [ playing guitar ] .we hear jimi hendrix do a lot of stuff like this [ playing guitar ] .you can write cool songs with this kind of a beat too .[ playing guitar ] .it 's great .it feels great .[ playing guitar ]
today i 'm going to show you how to properly lube a bike chain and how to lube up a rusty bike chain .first thing to do would be to start by cleaning the chain .for that you can use a good citrus degreaser biodegradable .works great for dissolving all the gunk that builds up on the chain and. [CLS] [SEP]for that we 'll just peddle the bike .while spraying a slight amount on the chain .you only need about two or three peddle rotations and then take a rag and your going to just hold the chain on the bottom and run it through that rag .as you peddle it .it should remove most of the rust and dirt and grime and once you 've cleaned the chain .you can then reapply a good coating of chain lube .this particular one is a teflon based lubricant .it works really well for bike chains .it will also inhibit the rust from forming .basically the same process as cleaning .you 're just going to peddle slowly while dripping it onto the chain .same thing. [CLS] [SEP]about three peddle rotations is all you need and then let it sit for about five to ten seconds and let it soak in and then take your rag and your going to try and remove any of the excess lube .that has accumulated on the outside of the chain .the only thing that it does on the outside of the chain .is help to attract more dirt .it 's not actually benefiting the chain at all. [CLS] [SEP]and there you have a properly lubed chain. [CLS] [SEP]and you probably want to do this .you know , about once every week or two .especially if your living in a very wet environment or at the beach .where chains are very prone to rusting very quickly and that should help prevent rust from forming and keep your bike running smooth .that 's how to lube a chain .
now i 'm going to show you the burmese dance from the proper position to the movement. [CLS] [SEP]so you will know how it is connected .the first thing i told you is about that feet of four finger tip apart to each other heel and then step and then to the back .and then do we have the other step too .one , two , and four .one , two and four .one , two and four .and other way we can , here , here and here and here and here .and to the back here , and here and here and here .
okay , starting from the fighting position , okay , there 's two way to do it .you can either take a small step back or you can just lean away .okay .as you lean away , you want to turn very slightly , keeping the head in a straight line with your front shoulder .you want to pick up the front leg , this way , kick straight out and then straight back down .okay , with the step , it 's exactly the same way .just step and turn a little , pick up the knee and kick straight out , straight in , then down .so again , you step up , kick and down .okay , from this angle .so he leans away , okay , see the shoulders straight line , going this way to complete 45 degree angle from his front foot , picks up the leg , kick straight out , straight in and down .okay , this kick is good against someone that 's either more powerful or a lot bigger than you .okay ,so , if someone comes with punches to the face , and they 're more powerful , okay , it 's easy , so you just lean back , pick up the foot , you kick straight in .okay .or , if you want to use it , it 's like a fake tactic .okay , so he punches , okay , you can block , lean in , disguides him in , then punch again .and as soon as he comes in , you kick there .so that 's the proper way to perform the leaning side kick .
all right , welcome back .i 'm bobby larew , your expert on diving .now , if you been following me so far , you 've gotten through the five step approach , right ?you 've probably made a few mistakes , maybe it has n't looked like mine .maybe yours looks better than mine .i hope it does , okay ?but if not , there 's a few common mistakes that people make , and i want to talk about those again .this first thing is , are you relaxing ?you need to relax in diving .if you 're standing there and notice that your face is getting flush and red , it means you 're not relaxed and you 're not breathing .okay ?here 's what i always do to avoid that mistake when i start .i breathe , i get on the board , i take a deep breath , let it out , and just chill for about five seconds .okay ?that 's how to avoid that mistake .another one that people make is rushing , and taking too fast steps , or just trying to get thorough the dive as fast as they possibly can .good diving is not rushed , okay , good diving is nice and slow and smooth .okay ?if you find yourself getting too fast , remember , slo..o..ow down .the last mistake that a lot of people make is. [CLS] [SEP]they forget a lot of the good posture , and the grace , and the poise .you might find yourself forgetting to have your fingers closed .you might find yourself hunching over a lot .okay ?just remember the basics , good posture .you want to look graceful .these are some of the mistakes that you can make , and how to avoid them .
and as you can see it 's quilted already as you went. [CLS] [SEP]but now we are going to use a solid piece of backing. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to show you how to mark it. [CLS] [SEP]so you can quilt it , so. [CLS] [SEP]here is the backing a solid piece 13 by 19 is what i 'm using for my size .we. [CLS] [SEP]have our backing 13 by 19 and here is our top. [CLS] [SEP]we colored this. [CLS] [SEP]we should make sure we have it going the right way , nope , so here we go , and again your kind of pin down just kind of make your sandwich you have your right side here. [CLS] [SEP]and your right. [CLS] [SEP]we are going to pin down the 4 corners , you can use a spray adhesive. [CLS] [SEP]it 's called spray basting if you wanted to , but on a small project like this i do n't think it 's necessary , just a couple of pins. [CLS] [SEP]now we just need to mark some lines and what you can do is free hand machine quilt. [CLS] [SEP], you can take your sewing matching and just quilt around here , but some where you really want to stabilize this a little bit more make it more secured sandwich .so i like to just do vertical lines. [CLS] [SEP]like i did in this one. [CLS] [SEP]and you can see the lines i sewed here on this particular one .i decided to sew around here and around our picture which you can see on the back , so it does n't have to be lines all the way through it just kind of a matter of preference .
it means bow pose. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to assist gina into this bow pose. [CLS] [SEP]so gina is going to come on down to her belly , good .she is going to bend her knees and reach back to her ankles if she can .she is going to flex her feet .as she rolls back she is going to lift her shoulders and then lift up. [CLS] [SEP]and she is going to press her feet up to the sky , good .you want to keep your knees together as much as you can .i 'm going to come. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to take gina 's ankles and lift her up into the pose even higher .inhale , lower down just a little bit , and then exhale and lift her up , notice how her shoulder blades are squeezing together , opening her heart and how her back is lengthened .she is getting really good back work , good .then lowering her down .that 's bow pose .
it gives you a lot of firmness. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's better to use that with your type of hair than a hairspray .this is what you do when you have layers. [CLS] [SEP]and it stays like that all over .and it gives you a nice shine and if you want to make it more funkier just go like that just massage the scalp like this .just put the bangs down a little bit , is that to funky for you .you can also make it smoother you do n't have to .
what we are going to do now is stabilize this .you want to make sure that you never pull out an object that 's been penetrating through someone .the only exception to that is actually through the cheek or anything nor anything in the chest that is going to impede with cpr .but because this is a hand injury and it 's not we want to stabilize it .you can use anything to put along the sides just to keep it from moving .what you want to keep this is from moving side to side or up and down .any movement such as that can cause more pain and also damage more tissue .so for this sake we are just going to use cling. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to put it side by side and hold it in place .what we actually would do is build this up even higher that way the top is not exposed because it ca n't be touched at all .so we would use the log technique of two here and another two .once we have all of those in place what we want to do is secure it .we will secure it with something such as cling .any tissue or wrapping would work though .just to show you the idea by putting another one here. [CLS] [SEP]you can cover up the exposed end .and the point of this now will just be to keep it all held in place .you want to make sure that you stabilize if it is a hand injury. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's gone through the other side you want to make sure that you stabilize the back part also .that way that ca n't be moved .however , if this pencil had gone through his chest or arm and it was n't exposed on the other side this would be the adequate way of stabilizing that in place .and then by doing that on both sides you have now immobilized the penetrating object. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's not able to cause more injury to the patient .
now , i 'm going to show you how to shine silver .you can use silver cups , silver candelabra , rings , anything out of silver .of course we have this special silver polishes. [CLS] [SEP]but if you do n't have one around the house .i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]sure you have toothpaste .you take some cotton and you put a little bit of toothpaste in and what you do is basically shine it .you can see them some of the tarnish has come out on the cotton .we 'll put some more once it 's very dirty .it 's better to find another part of the cotton and to continue the polish .after we 're done we are going to just wash it in water and dry it .make sure that you dry it good and your going to see that it is nice and shiny .so , that 's how we do an easy polishing of silver as you saw with the toothpaste and some cotton .
in this clip we 're going to talk about the musicality in cha cha .in cha cha , there are four beats , but five steps .how do we do this ?i 'm going to show you. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to walk and tell you how it is .we 're going to walk , 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 and 1 ; i 'm going to go to the other side. [CLS] [SEP]; it 's , 1 ,2 ,3 , cha cha cha ; again to the other side , 1 ,2 ,3 , cha cha cha ; i 'm going to do again ; it 's , 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 and 1.and this is the musicality for the cha cha .in the cha cha there are four beats but five movements , meaning that in one beat we 're going to do two steps .i 'm going to show you how is this done ; it 's , 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 and 1 ; you see , we have an extra step there ; on the other side , 1 ,2 ,3 , cha cha cha .
if you 're doing the layout of your own book , there 's several things that you need to know .no matter whether you 're using a word processing program , like microsoft word , or a layout program , like quark express , you need to remember that your margins have to be set correctly .be sure that your interior margins , which is along the side , have a wider margin than your exterior ones .but your exterior margins need to be at least a half an inch from the edge of you page .your interior margins need to be at least three quarters of an inch , sometimes more depending on how thick your book is , and how much space , because you do n't want your words running in to the spine of your book .so , talk to whatever publisher you 're planning on using , see if they have dimensions for you , and if you 're planning on printing it yourself , just make sure to allow that extra space on the interior of your page .if you 'll notice , you 've got about a half an inch from your exterior to the edge of your page , and your margins here .half an inch to three quarters at the top and bottom will allow you to put your headers and footers on your pages .you want to make sure that you have at least three quarters of an inch on your interior or spine so that your copy does n't run in to the middle of the page , and it 's easily readable .and good luck and have fun .
so we need to be able to talk to that electrical engineer and make it clear so that the lighting would work electrically .we also need to be able to understand theatrical lighting .what are the designs that theatrical designers use to create the mood in a space .lighting designers will sometimes refer to themselves as shadow designers .without shadows the space is very monotonous and very boring. [CLS] [SEP]so we want to be able to decide what we want to light and what we do n't want to light .
once you 've gotten your gourd cut you will see all the dried out seeds and pulp and it kinda looks like a dried pumpkin on the inside .again , safety concerns , because of the mold and all the little spores and things you wan na make sure and put your mask on .also , the eye protection is good too because the dust will get into your eyes as well .a couple of tools that i use to clean .i like to use a good melon baller , just any old kitchen utensils that you 're going to use strictly just for your gourds .ceramic cleaning tools work really well .another good thing when you 're doing bowls. [CLS] [SEP]and you have a really large area. [CLS] [SEP], this is something you can get at the hardware store , it 's an extension for your regular drill , and then the little wire wheels that they have at the hardware store .these come in many different configurations and sizes , fits in your drill and that gets in there real well to work on those bowl areas .when you have smaller areas like this then we can just use our hand tools .i 'll go ahead an put on my mask and my glasses and you just scrape away .it does take some time , you want to get down to the actual bare gourd in there , you want to get rid of all of this white , all of the seeds , as much of it as you can .and again you can see how very fine all that dust is. [CLS] [SEP]so that 's why you want to use a really good mask to keep that out of your breathing and keep that out of your eyes .
have you ever worked with a customer that at the very first thing they say is i just want to completely just want to discontinue with service .i do n't want this piece of equipment in my house. [CLS] [SEP]or i do n't want this cell phone. [CLS] [SEP]anymore i just want to be completely done with you .there are such things as customer contracts and there are certain policies. [CLS] [SEP]that you as a representative of your business and remember though you are there to provide good customer service .you are also there to protect the interest of your business as well you ca n't give them into every business in demand .if a customer came into my office for example 3 years after purchasing a water treatment system and just did n't wan to be under contract with them anymore .well i ca n't just dissolve that contract. [CLS] [SEP]i 'll be putting my job in jeopardy .it 's not something that a business allows us to do .so do n't put yourself in any jeopardy but again do n't just talk to the customer about what you will not or can not do .talk about what you can do instead , offer alternatives i for example dealing with that customer that i just mentioned i might say instead. [CLS] [SEP], i understand that you are unhappy with it .maybe it 's just not working right. [CLS] [SEP]i ca n't take it out of your house for you but let 's get somebody else take a look at it and see if we can discover what the problem is you are having with the system .it 's a technique that i used before and by offering that it does bring the customer back to another level of dealing with you .rather than bringing the extreme of being completely want to be done with it , now you can get them to negotiate and talk about what can be done instead of what you ca n't do .
i 've been in the entertainment tv world for about twenty years .i write some sketches , hopefully , i can help you out with that task of writing a comedy sketch .alright .first rule , it 's a sketch , not a skit .a skit is watching uncle charlie at the lodge put on a dress with coconut brazier , singing a song .that 's a skit .a sketch is what you 'll see on saturday night live , madtv , the daily show , and some of the better ones you 'll see on youtube , ok.topical versus timeless .if you 're going to write a sketch , and you want to make it topical , just remember , the shelf life for it , it 's not going to be very long .you zero in on the two thousand four elections , after about a year or so , people are going to be scratching their head going ,oh , that 's not very funny .timeless is something you can watch over and over , the comedy is genuine , it 's from the character .ok.once you know the talent of the group you 're working for , focus on that .you 've got a guy who can do a great impression of a certain person , use it .get into the sketch quickly .remember , this is n't a five hundred page book here .get into it quickly .if it 's not funny in the first five to ten seconds , maybe you should start on a different sketch .great if you can end it with a punch or button .you watch the parrot sketch on the old monty python show , it ends with a button .those are tough to do , but if you can do it , it 's a home run right there .keep it short .three to five minutes , no longer than that .and it better be funny .if you 're writing for youtube , remember you can keep it short , like thirty , twenty , forty seconds. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's a quick bit .alright ?do n't forget , you can also get it on the web , put a funny bit on youtube .good luck in your writing for a sketch humor .i 'm joe pauly , have fun .
tan sau is blocking across here , he punches with his other hand , gaan sau blocks low , gaan sau 's a low block .after you go into tan to gaan , it turns a wrist and goes into a palm strike .this movement is a huen sau and pushes into a palm strike right here .it can also be used kau sau if you use it differently .the different angle .but if i come around here like this , i push into a strike form there .so that 's huen sau into palm strike .after that section we have the bong sau to tan sau .and then the fak sau palm strike .if he grabs my arm here. [CLS] [SEP]and he 's punching here with a straight punch. [CLS] [SEP], if i deflect from bong sau here , i flip my arm to tan sau .that makes it very hard for him to hold onto it like that , then i pak sau the elbow and come into a straight punch .so as he 's grabbing me here i go into bong , i flip it to tan , and i pak sau it off .that 's the end section from bong to tan ,the reason why it drops into fak sau is to build to your energy and goes into a strike .the strike is a palm strike to the chin or to the neck here , to the throat using your palm , so if i go here and he punches here , i flip this up. [CLS] [SEP]and i go into a strike here. [CLS] [SEP], i can strike here , i can strike against his throat here .the last section that you see is a sweep .what you 're doing in this section is if , it 's almost the same thing , if he 's grabbing here i flip my palm up to tan , and i slap this hand off .now if he grabs this arm , i flip this palm up to tan , and i slap the hand off there .so those are some of the applications of sil lim tao .
to talk to you a little bit about the benefits to walking on a treadmill .well , first and foremost , it 's going to promote good health .walking on the treadmill or walking in general is really going to help to promote us to better health .walking on a treadmill however , one of the benefits of it is it 's a low impact activity .so if you 're worried about your ankles , or your knees or your hips of something like that , walking on a treadmill as oppose to walking outside is definitely going to be a lot more beneficial for us than walking outside .we 're going to really increase our cardiovascular endurance and cardiovascular strength .our lung capacity , our ability for us to take in more oxygen .we can also , some of the other benefits , we can really increase the speeds and the levels and the pace in which we 're walking .also the elevation .most treadmills these days have an incline control on them that go all the way up to about 15 % elevation grade .we can do that .we can really change and fluctuate our work out patterns and our walking patterns and really start to see some of those benefits in the way we look and the way we feel .this has been aaron hale talking to you about the benefits of walking on the treadmill here at fitness for life .thank you .
hi !next we 're going to do the front snap kick , which is really easy .you can do it right in your own living room and practice to get better and get a good workout out of it .you 're going to put your left leg in front and the right leg in the back .have your back foot a little off to the side .you do n't want to be like this and losing your balance .have it right here off to the side. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's real simple .you lift your knee up , press your heel out , and come back .now , the reason you lift your knee is if you do n't , the kick will just come up straight somebody 's body .the more you lift your knee and push it out , it goes into your opponent .another thing is use your heel so you do n't hurt your toes .if your toes are down you could break your toes .you 're going to bend your front knee , lift your knee up , snap it , and bring it back .now , the thing that people forget is they think they 're done after they kick it out .no , you 've got to pull your leg back fast. [CLS] [SEP]so nobody grabs your leg .when you kick , the other half of the workout is pulling it back fast , and you 'll feel it work the front of your legs a lot .at home , you can practice .after you 've done the boxing workout , you can go into your kicks and get a whole workout at home and just drill by kicking and bringing it back .you can practice kicking to somebody ’ s knee as you still need to bring your knee up first and go down and bring it back , or the middle , or you can practice to the face and come back down .then when you 're done with that , of course , you want to do the other side and work evenly .do your kicks if you can practice high if you 're super flexible , but bring your knee up first and kick and bring it back .we just did the front snap kick .another way to strengthen this kick and really get an intense workout is to bring your knee up , and you can hold something to balance as high as you can , and then extend your kick up .then take your hand away and hold it and keep your back straight , and just hold it .try to start with about 10 or 15 seconds and build up from there and then come down .then of course , you want to do the other side , so bring your knee up as high as you can and then extend it straight up .flex your foot and put the other hand like this and hold it up .
hi , i 'm ryan. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're talking about the 40d here .basically wanting to get into setting the white balance on your camera .there are a lot of presets which are going to be really useful .the way to navigate through those presets is by using the quick control dial on the back side of your camera that is , looks like a circle and has a set button in the middle .and also by using the white balance button on the top of your camera .there are four buttons on the top of your camera here and it is the second most button on the left .to select a white balance , what you need to do is press the white balance button here and then use the quick dial to scroll through the presets .now there are quite a few presets here .i 'll just kind of go through each one .the first one here is sunlight or just bright , outside , white balance setting .the next setting we have is a shade setting and it looks like there 's a little house or roof providing some shade there .the next setting we have is a cloud , cloudy day , maybe kind of gray outside .that 's a white balance setting for that .then we have a tungsten light setting here .you can see there 's a little tungsten bulb .then we also have a fluorescent light setting and then finally there is a flash light balance setting .most of these settings are going to be , are going to be pretty right on and really useful. [CLS] [SEP]if you 're shooting with another photographer and want your shots to match .instead of taking the time to pull a manual white balance , what you might do is just set both of the cameras to indoor fluorescent or indoor tungsten that way you know both of the cameras are going to have a very similar feel to the shots .
we 're going to be out here on the grill .we 're going to grill some wonderful marinated shrimp , we 're going to be cutting and chopping and prepping herbs , and beautiful garlic , and we 're going to be going inside and creating an amazing , authentic , rustic italian dish called pasta. [CLS] [SEP]com pesto that my mother taught me .i 'm going to teach you .also going to add this amazing dolce , a sweet that 's going to knock your socks off .so come on and join us .
i 'm about an inch thick here , 7/8 's and what that means is i 've got plenty of support all the way down in here .it 's that thickness all the way before i go any further. [CLS] [SEP]i want to true. [CLS] [SEP]this face up because as this starts to get thin back in here , this will become unsupported and become too flexible and it might cause it to actually catch when you are turning it .so i 'm going to clean the face off here. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'm going to start to make my finishing cuts down inside the bowl .i line my tool rest up here. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm just going to come right straight across .the bevel is going to be in line and make a cut right straight across .i will start in the middle , go across , and come back and do this .bevel. [CLS] [SEP]right in the middle of the rim .now i 've got that .i 've got a little. [CLS] [SEP]but if a hump there .i want this rim to have a little bit of shape , not quite flat .again where i just trued up i can now rub that bevel and true this .that 's got my rim nice and trued up .be careful. [CLS] [SEP]this edge here is very sharp .i am just going to sand it lightly .once or twice i have bumped up against it. [CLS] [SEP]and i 've cut myself .so watch out for that edge .just hit it with a little light sand paper. [CLS] [SEP]and then it will dull it. [CLS] [SEP]and it wo n't be sharp .
this beginner pilates exercise is called the bridge .and we 're really going to focus on working the gluts , the lower back and the abdominal muscles .so come on down to your mat , and you want to think about pulling your navel in towards your spine , lower your arms down , pull your shoulder blades back to create a solid anchor .your feet are about hip width apart .inhale to prepare. [CLS] [SEP]and then as you exhale start with your tail bone and peel your spine up off the mat , one vertebrae at a time .inhale at the top as you squeeze your gluts and exhale in printing one vertebrae at a time into the mat .inhale at the bottom and exhale , really contract those abdominal muscles .inhale at the top and exhale as you come down .now you want to imagine that your spine is a strand of pearls .so you 're lifting one pearl at a time off the mat , squeezing the gluts , contracting the abdominal muscles and coming on down and rest .so you 'll want to perform anywhere between eight to ten reps of the bridge .and there you have it .
so bend your right knee , last time , take the strap around the balls of the toes and stretch your right leg more straight up toward the sky .as the right leg stretches straight , create a steadiness and an evenness in the leg muscles , and then for the bigger opening , take the right leg five inches towards the left , just five inches .it 's a big stretch .then from that you 're going to take the leg all the way over , and you can even roll onto the outer edge of your bottom leg .as you roll all the way over , keep the right foot lifted off the floor and push the foot actively into the strap .take a few more full breaths , you can even stretch your right arm toward the right and twist the torso toward the right .lift the foot a little bit higher , toward your face and then inhale and lift your right leg all the way back up .level out your hips , bend the knee and release the right leg down .
and i 'm a modern dance instructor in austin , texas .i 'm going to show you a variation on rolling through your feet that will be a nice warm up for your ankles and your feet .so all we are going to do is make little rolls with our feet on the floor .i 'm going to use my toe and push my toe to the floor to roll through my ankle. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm really just rolling around , isolating my ankles just to warm up my feet a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'll do them one way. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'll do them the other way. [CLS] [SEP]and you get a little elastic motion in your whole body once you start doing this .and you can really let it move through your whole body if you want to. [CLS] [SEP]and it will warm up your legs a little bit also and your hips and your feet .it is a nice way to get started moving in modern dance. [CLS] [SEP]and so that 's one way to roll through the feet in modern dance where you are going to really get yourself warmed up .

in this clip , all we 're doing is simply putting the kite away .we just went out on the water , had a sick session , great day .but , basically , we want to make sure that we are going to put this kite away in a fashion that 's going to promote us going out and doing that again real nice and easy next time .so , just to keep good bridle maintenance here and make sure nothing 's getting too twisted , i 'm going to detach these lines. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to reattach the bridles to each other .that way , one bridle ca n't get intertwined within itself and. [CLS] [SEP]i know everything is just going to be exactly the way. [CLS] [SEP]i left it next time. [CLS] [SEP]i pull this kite out .so , i go ahead , i detach those lines and just attach these two bridles just to each other like that .go over here to this other one , do the same thing .and , if you look at the kite , you can see that this kite has a good amount of sand on it .i use my kite everyday. [CLS] [SEP]it 's windy. [CLS] [SEP]and i need to make sure that these kites are always in proper working order .so , in order to , you know , really assure that and make sure , you know , that it 's absolutely up to par every time i need it to be , i keep absolutely perfect care of my kites .i will never put them away if they are sandy .and , if they are wet when i get home , i make sure i let them out to dry .really important is , if your kite is wet with salt water , it 's not necessarily the worst thing in the world , these kites are made to be wet. [CLS] [SEP], obviously , you use them in the water all the time , but salt water actually does n't mould .that 's the big thing about it .so , if it 's wet with salt water , you can put it away and that 's alright .but if it rains on it or you 're kiting somewhere in the great lakes or. [CLS] [SEP]somewhere where it 's just fresh water , make sure when you put the kite away , you 're putting away a dry kite .because the next time you open your bag and pull out your kite , all of a sudden , you 're going to find all this nasty mould wrapped around the entire thing .i reach forward , grab my bar. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to sort of reel up this last little bit of excess line. [CLS] [SEP]and then just , you know , anyway. [CLS] [SEP]i can , just kind of hitch it off , tuck it through , and make sure this excess sort of little ends right here .
hey guys !we 're her today learning how to do some improv exercises .the next exercise we 're going to show you is a game called my ghost friend .to play my ghost friend , you 're going to get 2 improvisers that are going to create a scene .one of the actors is going to be a ghost who can not be seen , but only heard .the other improviser is going to play somebody who is friends with the ghost and comes to the ghost to seek advice for some sort of situation or trouble he got himself into earlier .keep in mind as the improviser playing the ghost , you can ’ t be seen , but you can be heard and you can interact with your player by touching him or moving something on him in some sort of fictitious fashion as if someone was being manipulated or moved by a ghost .i think you guys will get the hang of it .it 's a fun game to play .we always have a blast whenever we play it .dan , you want to be the ghost. [CLS] [SEP]or you want me to be the ghost ?you can be the ghost .you want me to be the ghost ?ok.dan 's going to come to me with some sort of situation. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to try bail him out as a ghost .hey ghost friend .hey buddy , why you so sad ?my girlfriend dumped me last week and i still have n't really gotten over it .she dumped you ?well maybe you need to fix your hair .let me blow it up for you .i 've known you for years , but i 'm still not used to that .i hope it did n't give you the chills .a little bit , but it 's worth it to have a friend as great as you .well thanks buddy .that really means a lot to me .now just for old times ’ sake , let me pass through you .well , alright .thanks .you have to tighten kind of like abs .whoa !i was n't ready that time .does that cheer you up ?a little bit .i wish i could see you .that 's how you play my ghost friend .
we are going to show you how to play chords when you are playing with a band using 2 hands voicings .we got our little live band here on the keyboard. [CLS] [SEP]and we are just going to go through them to g minor to the d minor. [CLS] [SEP]the relative major .so you got d minor , then b minor .so notice when i 'm playing the f minor i go out of the b flat and when i go into the d i have voicing all over it .it is not in a void note , but it is not one of the root notes as well .so we just take that pattern and move your hands around .so you can go and get some of your friends and just have them jam out in a couple of basic chords and just move your hands around and get that scale under your fingers in f major .
we do n't actually need to mark anything .the second knot has got to be right of the edge of this. [CLS] [SEP]so also we have to do. [CLS] [SEP]is tie this knot .just like before , you can keep moving the knot down .keep moving it down to where it 's at the back of the bead where it needs to be .so as you 're -- there you go .as you 're tying it and then putting it into place , remember that you had extra length for beads. [CLS] [SEP]so you can measure with your first mark .if i can even see my last mark and see how much -- see if you have used up too much space so far .we have n't .we 've only put two knots in there .we know now that we ca n't tie another knot without putting the charm in the center .if we start tying knots here , we 're going to have to undo the glue on the charm and that will break the safety pin .so we 're going to actually put -- pick which side you like for the -- obviously the side with the most blood .i 'm going to pick the front .so just put that through the hole .you do n't need to put a knot to keep this in place .it can be free to move around a little bit .in fact , it 's better if they can move around a little bit .that way it does n't get stuck and jab into you somewhere .so now that we 've got the first bead on there and the first two knots , we 'll tie the first knot for the second bead. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's going to be the opposite way that we did the first one .so we 'll do that next .
now we 're gon na go through designing images for your web site .this is mainly part one of this .so as you can see here this is gon na be the basis of our front page image here .this is what you can see when the home page come up , so .we 're gon na start with , i already pre-deformed the images here .i already have done it. [CLS] [SEP]but i kind of click out the layers to show you some of the steps that i have taken for the site , so .we 're gon na start by putting in a back ground layer .a back ground layer adds , as you can see that 's also the same image that i used in my band .we changed the opacity to eighteen .and that 's my back ground .gon na start with that .and then we 're gon na add other images there to make up our front page image .
first we 're going to take our kettle off the main heat , then we 're going to take our malt extract which has been soaking in hot water , start mixing it in very nice and slowly , and trying to make sure that it all gets blended in .now a tip that you may not get from a lot of other brew starters is that you do n't actually want to add all the malt extract right now .instead , we 're going to add roughly half to two-thirds of the extract .what this will prevent is some of the caramel-y flavors which are associated with extract brewing .the rest of the extract we 're going to add with about fifteen to twenty minutes left .during this process , you want to continually stir to make sure everything is all mixed together , and that none of it is going to be left on the bottom in order to scorch .now that you 've got two-thirds or half of the extract put in , just continually stir it , turn on your heat , and start working on getting up to a boil .in particular , if you 're going to be using dry malt extracts , you never want to add that while it 's boiling , you want to add that before hand or else. [CLS] [SEP]it will clump heavily and it will be very hard to break into sections .as you can see we are getting nice and close to a boil , at this point you really want to be careful with your temperature , you do n't want to over shoot your boil and have a boil over because this creates a huge mess , and you basically do n't want to spend a lot of time cleaning that up .so carefully turn down your temperature and watch carefully for the boil , do not leave .here you can see the first boil bubbles pushing through , so you really want to be careful with your temperature now .once you have a nice rolling boil going , make sure it does n't get too vigorous , that the foam does n't rise too high and start going out of your pot .otherwise , if it does , you can kind of spray it down with a sprayer , or possibly drop ice cubes in .it 's going to foam up , but with a little temperature management , you should be ok .
definitely you want to -- you want to go to both the nwra and nwrc websites , and just glean as much information as you possibly can from those websites , and you also can look into your state to see if your state will have a state organization , because they will usually have a conference yearly -- your state organization will usually have a small conference yearly that would probably be easier for you to get to , as opposed to maybe trying to get to one of the national conferences .anything that you can do to just immerse yourself into what 's happening in the world of wildlife rehabilitation .your best thing is going to be able to find a wildlife rehabilitator that you can volunteer with .that 's where you 're going to get your full on experience with it .and that 's the very best thing that you can do .it 's wonderful to have a little bit of anal retentiveness going on .i mean , because there are things that you do need to be precise about .but , you ca n't -- you have to be flexible .you can not have tunnel vision , and just be focused on what you 're doing at this particular time .you have to be aware of what 's going on around you at all times .and you have to be able to drop and adjust .put down what you 're doing , finish up if you have something you need to finish , finish it up , and dive into something if you 've got , you know , something else major going on .and then come back to this and finish this up .you. [CLS] [SEP]-- it 's all about really adapting .being very , very flexible , very adaptable , and just realizing that even when it 's horrible , that you 're doing more good than anything else .
i took the wall paper and i matched it with the valance , the shower curtain and the skirt and the paint i took and the paint store. [CLS] [SEP]matched the paint to the valance the blue color also .
once you have got ollieing off a ledge down pat the next thing to do is start practicing stalling .stalling is just pretty much learning how to grind but going really really slow. [CLS] [SEP]and there is all sorts of different stalls you can do .next i am going to teach you about stalling .the important that before stalling is you want to have a nice high ollie and be able to make it on top of whatever you are trying to stall on before you attempt to stall on it and basically stalling. [CLS] [SEP]is just attempting to grind something which is just flying across it with your trucks but with not enough speed. [CLS] [SEP]so you come to a standstill or a stall .there is all different types of stalls .there is a 50/50 stall , there is a 5 0 stall , there is a nosegrind stall , that would be a nose stall , your board up on it would be a board stall .i mean there is limitless types of stalls out there but again just to remind you. [CLS] [SEP]this is how you practice grinding on stuff. [CLS] [SEP]but eventually you are going to get the speed factor down. [CLS] [SEP]and you are going to be able to start moving rather than just coming to a standstill. [CLS] [SEP]and i am going to just demonstrate real quick what practicing board stalls will eventually lead to .
hi , i 'm donna barnes , i 'm a life and dating coach and owner of ny dating coach here in new york city .in this clip we 'll talk about what smells attract men and the very basic one is your own .there 's been recent scientific study that 's learned about pheromones , and pheromones are the same things that attract animals to each other .they 've always known that , that exists , but recently they 've learned that humans have a little detector in their nose as well .so , really where chemistry comes from. [CLS] [SEP]is from smell .it 's subconscious that when we meet somebody whose smell is appealing to us , that 's what makes us attracted to them .that 's where the chemistry comes from .so , if you have a date , make sure that you just smell clean .make sure you smell clean and fresh and like yourself , and if you do wear any kind of scent , make sure it 's a light one , body lotions are good .they do say that vanilla , cinnamon and lavender are all scents that men like .so , maybe try some natural body lotion that has a little bit of that .this is donna barnes from new york city .

leg circles are probably one of the most frequently done incorrect pilates exercises and they take a lot of control .obviously , start by initiating the roll down line sublime on the mat .and to start out with if you are a beginner you can leave the opposite knee bent and. [CLS] [SEP]what you want to do is take that foot and line it up with the knee joint and the hip .now from here we want to try not to press against the floor because as we take the toe and draw a circle in circular motion and active range of motion with all those joints lined up were going to control the movement with the mid section , all that core strength .do about 8-10 taking it on the outside of the circle and then rotate 8-10 on the inside .if you want , you can stay in a sit up position or relax your head .now if you want to get a little more advanced you would extend the opposite leg now. [CLS] [SEP]you 've got more momentum and stability to maneuver and control , and again , it 's a very small and controlled circle .you 're going to have your own active range of motion , work within your range , and again reverse , and really be careful not to use momentum , its muscle over momentum pilates is all about control logy .
now , we 've learned how to construct and play an a-tonic major arpeggio on the violin .but now , let 's take a look at it on staff paper .take a look .we have an a , all right , which is the first degree of our scale of arpeggio , so we put one under it .next , is c sharp ?use this accidental right here , the one that looks like a tic-tack-toe box , okay , is a sharp .it means you raise the pitch .so if this was c natural i 'd put a sharp , it 's c sharp now , second scale degree , so two is under it .third for e , fourth for a , and a has an open , a zero above it .that means it 's played on an open string .next we have c sharp , see our accidental .five , six , also has an open string because it 's an open e seven , three .eight is one .we switch up in the fourth position , so we put the one over that for our fingering .nine is three , third fingering , and ten is four .
now , i want to talk for just a second about the selection of your leaves .because , it is important what kind of leaves you choose .what 's important about the leaf is first of all that it be a nice soft supple leaf so that it will roll into the clay very easily without cracking .the second very important thing is that the back of the leaf have pronounced veins .a lot of leaves you 'll look at the front side , they 're pretty you like the shape .but , if you flip it over the back is almost flat and you 're not going to get any detail transferred onto your clay .this small oval leaf is an example of a leaf that wo n't work well .it 's hard .it 's a hard leaf and it 's also it does n't have very much on the back there .and , i 'm going to roll it in just to show that there 's not a whole lot of detail coming out of that leaf .so , later on in the project when we try to glaze that area you 're not going to see much at all .but , then this leaf which is a mint leaf it has a lot of pronounced veins on the back of it .and , if i roll that in there you can see all the veins going all the way to the edge of the leaf and the center vein is very pronounced .and , that 's what you want to look for is some leaf that 's very soft with pronounced veins .maple leaves are excellent if you 're looking for big leaves .fig leaves are also excellent .there 's other , there 's plenty of different leaves that work really well .but , those are two that i really like myself .
the wood chop is a just functional exercise , and like the name says , it 's just like chopping wood .i know that most of us have never done it , even though if you have , more power to you .and you want to think about the move because we are all familiar with it though .when you get into this stance , your feet are shoulder width apart , toes slightly out , and you want to keep your knees from locking them. [CLS] [SEP]and you want keep them bent .now you want the hips to be tilted this way , you want to bring the hip bones towards your ribs , like almost like pulling the front of your pants , o.k . [CLS] [SEP]and keep that throughout the exercise , make sure that your abdominal wall is not hanging out , mostly coming in , sucking it in towards the lower back .now , just like having an ax , if you want to imagine that , you 're hands are together , you 're coming across from the top right , or your top left if you 're facing me , and coming across and down .as i 'm twisting you notice that my shoulders are going. [CLS] [SEP]but my hips are not , i 'm not doing this , o.k .and also i want to make sure to point out the shoulder should not be coming forward .so you want to keep the chest open and just do this , a twisting motion that you want to get out of here .so up and down , you do a few on that side , and then you start with the left , again keeping the hips steady and just twisting from the upper body .shoulders are open and back , so you can always have your chest facing the move .it 's almost like leading with your chest right here .make sure that you keep it even on both sides , make sure that you pay attention to any unevenness or any unbalances that may happen if one side is easier than the other .keep that tuck , keep that vacuum and before you know it your core is going to be so much more stronger and your back problems are going to start dissipating .so try it out you wo n't be sorry .
i 'm going to show you how to add a nice little cursor to your page .how 's it going ?i 'm jason ketchmark from myspace 4 musicians .i 'm going to show you how to change the standard cursor that we all know to something that looks a little bit nicer .finding a myspace cursor for your page is as simple as going to google and searching myspace cursors .as you can see , we 've typed it in .let 's do a google search , and pick one of these pages .now , this page , for instance , usually , they divide them up into categories , so let 's pick the category .we 'll pick an arrow cursor and not go too crazy .and basically , it has the boxes for the code , so we 're going to copy that .hold on , i got to redo that .because i got to use safari , so it pops up the thing .finding a cursor for your page is very simple .there 's a lot of websites out there that already have a wide variety of cursors that you could select from that are free .ca n't go wrong with that .so we 're going to type in myspace cursors , and you can see ,we 've got a lot of results , so let 's just go ahead and pick one .all right .now , most of these websites will divide the cursors up into categories if they have a lot , so just pick a category that you like .and we 're going to pick cartoon cursors in this case .and now , it has all the different ones .and now , with this site , when you mouse over it , it actually shows you the cursor .other websites , you know , they might have it a little bit different .maybe you 'll see the cursor on the left or right or something .but all of them are going to have a box with code in it , so you want to select the code .most of them will automatically select when you click in it .and if not , you could just go and click in the box -- right-click , select all .okay .the code 's selected .now , we 're going to right-click and hit copy .and go back to our myspace page to add the cursor .now , we 're in edit profile mode right here , so from the homepage , just click edit profile .and any one of these boxes ...usually , you want to do it in the about box because that 's going to be the easiest and less cluttered .hit paste -- right-click , paste .puts the code in .you save the changes .now , something to keep in mind is that not all browsers will actually put the new cursor into effect .so usually internet explorer will be the most common one , but just keep that in mind in case it 's not working on a couple of your friends ' browsers .that is how you add a custom cursor to your myspace page .i 'm jason ketchmark from the myspace 4 musicians .have a fun time clicking .
these are some of the thinnest frames that you are probably going to find on any frame shop wall .they should not really be used for anything over a 16x20 .do to the fact when you put them together back here. [CLS] [SEP]it is held together on. [CLS] [SEP]one v nail cause you can not get 2 in there because there is not enough wood to get it in there .some of them are even smaller then others .if you look at this one with this scoop here where it is scooping out your v-nails have to come in so far to not be able to go through the outside of this scoop area where it is protruding out .so it is thinner wood here then what it is here .i went to put over one matte at the most 2.you have to think about how that is put together when you put your glass or your plexi or whatever in your matte and your picture .it starts to get pretty thick so when you think about that. [CLS] [SEP]and you look here. [CLS] [SEP]you have things protruding out the back edge .therefore it is not going to look good on the wall especially at a traffic area. [CLS] [SEP]cause they are going to see the stuff hanging out the outside of that edge .this is just one picture on a cardboard and as i put it on there. [CLS] [SEP]it almost took up the whole well of the picture .the rabbit part of the picture .so you really do n't have anything to nail it to .if i had a piece of glass it would a little bit more or. [CLS] [SEP]if i had a matte it would start to stick out the back .if that is a in a traffic area that is going to be seen as you walk down the wall .that is not a attractive look to almost anybodies home .i try not to go there because of that fact .so these are probably more like simple simple pieces of art that do n't have a lot of detail to them .that do n't have a lot of thickness to them .they are great pieces to use. [CLS] [SEP]but i do recommend that you stay under a 16x20 with those .
alright , now i 'm going to talk about a series of , a series of words that are good for articulation , but they are also just really good general vocal warm-ups .we 've talked about how we 've had all these consonants. [CLS] [SEP]and i 've given you these consonant warm-up activities .now , let 's jump on over to words .and , you can come up with any kind of word combinations that you want , but you want to take two word combinations that articulate the same consonant .like , `` paper poppy '' .and you want to repeat that as many times as you can .paper poppy , paper poppy , paper poppy , paper poppy .again , the object is to go fast , but not so fast the words are not articulated .`` baby bubble , baby bubble , baby bubble , baby bubble . [CLS] [SEP]''making sure to put enough emphasis on every consonant .`` paper poppy . [CLS] [SEP]''`` baby bubble . [CLS] [SEP]''you can also move into rhyming words or phrases like `` rubber baby buggy .rubber baby buggy . [CLS] [SEP]''where they still are using a variety of the same consonant and they 're almost like tongue twisters. [CLS] [SEP]but they 're just short pops of words that you can pretty much guarantee a success with. [CLS] [SEP], you 're not going to get lost around the way .and , you can articulate and really warm up these consonants .try to write some up , come up with every combination of consonant words that you can , get them memorized , so that when you 're driving to go to the speech or the audition , or whatever it is , you can be saying them over and over again in your car .next we 're going to talk about words that we tend to articulate and run together .
the next thing we 're going to cover is the tunnel .the tunnel comes in different sizes anywhere from eight to twenty feet .the best way to start the tunnel is to take it down to its shortest length and have the owner at the other end with some treats to encourage the dog to go through .so you would have someone holding him an one end and the owner would coax him through at the other end .argo , come .good boy !lots of praise .keep it nice .this can be a scary obstacle for them .switch them .you can go progressively longer and longer but your end result , you need to have it at it full length .this is not a full length tunnel .this is only an 8 inch or 8 foot tunnel .and how you would get him to go through after training them. [CLS] [SEP]is , tunnel !good boy !same thing with the chute. [CLS] [SEP], you want to get their attention the second they go through .as you 're training , you want to take them with you .have your treats .tunnel ! .take them through .meet them at the end .good boy !lots and lots of praise .
in this clip we are going to talk about maintenance for these birds .so , basic maintenance obviously , is food and water .the other maintenance is , these guys get a little bit bored , so you may want to switch out their toys .they should have a decent amount of destructible toys in their cage that they can destroy and like sift through , so any sort of destructible toy needs to be replaced once it becomes destroyed .and these guys also , to maintain their feather quality , they either needed to be misted on a daily basis or by a daily basis , if you can , with a small mister .you can also offer these birds , a lot of them love to take baths , you can offer them a very swallow bowl of water .put it on the bottom of the cage and these birds will like jump in and take a little bath and fluff the water up over their feathers and let it run down their back .the water helps remove any soot and stuff that might be in your household that is accumulating and any sort of dusts .basically , keep their feathers clean .also , compare to their environment , our homes with air conditioning and heat , tend to be extra dry , so lots of time they will have trouble molting their feathers properly and it can end up with some damaged feathers if they do n't have a high enough humidity .again , if you mist them a couple of times a day , this help compensate for the low humidity in your home and keeping a good feather health for these guys .basic other stuff that these guys need , is surely recommended that once year you take them to a vet .where a vet can hold them still and look underneath their feathers , and check underneath their wings .open up their mouths and look into their eyes , to make sure that there is n't beginnings of any serious health problems , which , is difficult for the average owner to do .sometimes these guys need to have their nails trimmed as their nails will get overgrown .if you take your bird out of the cage or considering taking it outside , you need to decide whether to clip these guys wings .it can be fun to have a bird that can fly all over your house and come and goes as it please , but it can also be very dangerous for the bird .so , you may have to clip your birds wings every 12 weeks to every 6 months depending on where and how often your bird is molting .the other basic thing is cage maintenance , so that there is not any loose strings .check your cage so that there is not anything that may wrap around their toes or legs and cut of circulation .you need to clean out their cage. [CLS] [SEP]and i recommend cleaning it out at least every other day .put down a newspaper and clean it up .at least you can tell if your bird has been eating and all of its stools are looking normal .they are not too bad as far as just day to day maintenance , considered .especially if you only have one bird that you spend at least a couple of hours a day with it .have sort of a more intimate time with your bird , by either sitting next to the cage and talk to them , or having them out with you .if they have other birds they can interact with , you do n't have to spend as much one-on-one time , you just have to make sure that the environment they live in , is safe .
cinnamon or nutmeg right there ; you do n't need much a little goes a long way , some grated cheese ( 1/2 cup ) , and then our ricotta nice and creamy that looks really nice .we are going to fold that together to incorporate the egg. [CLS] [SEP]and then once we fold it. [CLS] [SEP]you can see how it looks .i think we 're going to add the rest of the ricotta to this or some more ricotta .this is going to be layered in our lasagna along with the mozzarella. [CLS] [SEP]i think some people skip the ricotta mixture. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's nice and creamy and tangy. [CLS] [SEP]it really adds something to finished product .when we come back we 're going to assemble our lasagna .
we 're now going to talk about choosing tiles for your tile mosaic project .there are two basic types of tiles to choose from , low fire tiles and high fire tiles .the low fire versus the high fire basically refers to the temperature at which the tiles are baked at in the kiln .low fire tiles are much easier to break and to shape , and tend to come in much brighter colors .they 're also a little bit cheaper , but because they were baked at a lower temperature , they 're more porous , so they 're only very good for indoor use .high fire tiles can be used for indoor or outdoor use .they 're a little sturdier , a little heartier , and wo n't absorb moisture .tiles come in all shapes and sizes , from very , very small , to very big and colorful .you can also get tiles in solid colors , you can get them with bright and beautiful designs , and you can even get shapes .so look at your local hardware store , your tile store , or even the junkyard for all sorts of different tiles for your mosaic project .
today i am going to teach you how to change a fluorescent light bulb .most fluorescent light bulbs are located in the kitchen area or in the garage and what you can do you can locate the one that is giving you trouble .either it is flickering on and off or it is off all together .now what you want to do is you want to go over to that light fixture and if it 's an exposed bulb. [CLS] [SEP]you can actually just turn the light switch off , let it cool down. [CLS] [SEP]and then you can reach up there. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to turn it a half a turn until the pins on the end line up with the sleeve on the casing .then you want to take the bulb out .you want to go down to the store and find one that is the same size .it has to be the same size. [CLS] [SEP]otherwise it wo n't fit .and then you want to come back to the house , take the new bulb , line the pins up with the sleeve on the jacket. [CLS] [SEP]and then you want to slide it back into place , rotate it a half a turn until it locks into position. [CLS] [SEP]and then you can go back and turn your light switch on. [CLS] [SEP]and it should work .be careful when disposing of these light bulbs because they do tend to violently explode because they do have gases inside .typically you want to wrap them in some type of cloth before you throw them away .just be careful when handling them or disposing of them .if you have any other questions you can come visit me at parkerhomerenovations.com.

earlier we learned the c minor scale and now we are going to learn the c minor arpeggio .we 're just going to learn the c minor arpeggio in the first position and just play in one octave .this is the c minor arpeggio .and going down .and as you will be able to hear the c minor arpeggio sounds a little bit darker , it 's because instead of playing and e what you are playing in the minor arpeggio is actually an e flat. [CLS] [SEP]so it gives that darker sound that i was talking about earlier when i was talking about playing major scales versus minor scales .so now you 've learned the c major scale , the c major arpeggio along with the c minor scale and the c minor arpeggio. [CLS] [SEP]and next we 're going to learn a couple of other minor arpeggios that correspond with the other minor scales we learned earlier in this series .
we have taken our potatoes out , we let them boil. [CLS] [SEP], got them soft , got them in a bowl. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to add our garlic to the potatoes .we are going to start mashing those together. [CLS] [SEP]and i start off by using just a potato masher .if you had a ricer you could use that but just to get it mashed as later once we start adding our other ingredients i 'm actually going to use a mixer and kind of mix these a little more to make them a little smoother .it takes a little work to mash them up. [CLS] [SEP]but hey the results would be wonderful .so i will continue mashing here , mixing that garlic that we have with our potatoes. [CLS] [SEP]and we would move on to our next step .
in the intermediate section of striking , a yokomen uchi is a side strike which is a lot like a shomen strike where it comes up and down , only now , it 's a circular strike to the side of the head .targeting , one of my favorite points is right here on the side of the neck .imagine he 's frankenstein , and has bolts coming out of the side of his neck .that 's exactly where i want to hit him .along good place is right along the , right below the ear , right along the jawline .if you hit someone really hard on this side , it 'll actually break the jaw on this side .and if that 's a viable thing that you can do , in a self-defense situation , and you think well that 's very not aikido-like ,well , breaking his jaw versus having to kill him , that 's harmonious to me .if he 's really trying to attack me and the only thing i can do to stop him is to break his jaw to stop him. [CLS] [SEP], i think that 's a pretty good choice .but when i 'm teaching my students i 'll usually tell them to hit them in the side of the neck .there 's a pressure point on the side of the neck. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to see an example from this , just from hitting him like that it will drop the person down .obviously in training class you do n't want to hit that hard on your uchi .but if you need to hit someone for real , that 's the way i would do it .come in here and hit the person into the neck .on the side of the jaw you 'd see even greater reaction , but there 's a chance for damage. [CLS] [SEP]so i usually do n't hit people too hard on the side of the jaw .but in training , step in , wham , that 's exactly where i 'm going to aim for .the other thing a yokomen strike. [CLS] [SEP], that can be a hook punch .i 'll teach punching to the side of the jaw too , just like this .they need to get out of the way , if i 'm using my knuckles to a hook punch , i 'll strike right on the side of the jaw here , or right back here behind the ear , and dig my knuckles into it , just like this .he needs to learn to get out of the way , otherwise i will hit him .
i 'm going to demonstrate how to do triplets .i 'm going to use the entire drum kit , but my main focus is going to be between my right foot and my two hands .a triplet as it implies is 3 hits .it 's also used a lot in heavy metal music which i play heavy metal , so how appropriate that it happens to be one of my favorite things to do .this is for matt by the way .okay matt , ready buddy ?here we go .that was a triplet with some other fancy stuff at the end .
the last zone that is still used in play is called the phased-out zone .the phased-out zone is a special place in the game where you put creatures or other permanents that have the ability phasing .anything that has phasing that is in play currently is put into the poz at the beginning of your turn .in fact , before you untap , that 's the only thing that can happen before your untapped step .once things are out of play in the phased out zone , anything that has phasing in the zone is put back into play .what this does is it means everything with phasing is in play only every other turn .so , half of the time it is in play , half of the time it 's out of play , alternating every turn .things that phase in have haste if they 're creatures .that means that things that have phased out and back in can still attack .
the last stretch we did was shoulder rolls .the next stretches we 're going to do are crisscross .so when you 're crisscrossing your arms you want to bring your , starting from the back or starting from forward , it really does n't matter .when you bring your arms back you really want to feel that stretch in your pectorals and your shoulder when you bring it back .and when you crisscross your arms forward , you really want to feel the stretch back in your , the back of your deltoids , in the back of your shoulders .so as you bring it back , you 're going to feel a stretch in your front , forward feel the stretch towards the back .now when you 're crisscrossing arms. [CLS] [SEP]it 's okay to have your right arm come over your left , go back , left arm over your right .you can switch it up. [CLS] [SEP], it 's okay .be careful you do n't want to smack your hands together ,so really think of you know , getting that one hand over the other .and get them as close to each other as you can , you do n't want these huge gaps .i mean you can do that and you 're going to stretch different parts of your shoulders , but keeping them closer together is better .okay. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's going to look like this when you 're doing your crisscross arm stretches .and that 's the stretch .
when it starts to boil for a little bit then i 'm going to drop the temperature down to low. [CLS] [SEP]so the rice can cook up slowly. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'm going to show you how to add my pieces of bacon bits and pieces of pork in a little bit .so here it is cooking it is going to look like this for right now , cover it high heat , let it sit for about 10 minutes like that .this rice cooks pretty fast it does n't take too long to cook and then of course come back after the 10 minutes is on high put it on low and let it cook for a little while longer .it should take about 30 minutes to cook this rice , maybe twenty .
so i had the bedroom suite that they used when they were married , i have a chair that was in my parent ’ s bedroom for years , and i wanted to put pictures of my family up here .this is a picture frame that was as i said , a twelve dollar mirror was in this and it came apart , the mirror broke or something. [CLS] [SEP]so i had this already framed of my parents. [CLS] [SEP]so i just thought that ’ s kind of cool , i have this bare wall over here , i ’ ll put pictures up. [CLS] [SEP]so i put the picture inside the picture and it ’ s a neat budget way of utilizing. [CLS] [SEP]and i think it ’ s a really cool effect .
it basically started by being able to launch clay targets .i 'll give you some examples of clay targets , which were thrown in the air at various and different angles , and it was called shooting around the clock .and there was a point in the center where a trap was located , and it launched targets in different directions , simulating what you would experience in the field .it turned out to be a very successful game .there was a contest in outdoors magazines , and the person from montana who named the game skeet , which is a scandinavian word meaning `` to shoot . [CLS] [SEP]''the game has progressed over the years and has become a very competitive game , but still skeet fields are used to hone your skills for the hunting season and can be used during the off-season to hone those skills .
i 'm going to go ahead and demonstrate a goal kick .usually your goal will be about right here .you 'll have your lines right here for the smaller part of the goal. [CLS] [SEP]and then the actual goal , or not the actual goal but the goal lines will extend about fifteen to twenty feet outside and that will be the whole goalie box .but the goal kick itself will be from a smaller box and they can put the ball , there 'll be a small goal line right in front of the box , and they can put the ball anywhere within that goal line and that 's where they go ahead and do that in which is called a goal kick .and so they basically get a free kick to go ahead and kick it down field to where one of their players are .they 'll stop , set up , take their time and then kick it .
this split finger is a pitch that is gripped with the first finger and second fingers severely outside the ball with the thumb under the ball .the split finger causes the ball to rotate very slowly or basically not at all and causes the ball to drop severely when it reaches the batter and that 's a split finger .
today i 'm going to teach you how to install a new cabinet door .now , the first thing you need to do is find the opening for the cabinet door , and you need to measure it .you 'll have to measure it height wise , and width wise to get the proper fitting door for that application .then you 'll want to go down to any hardware store that carries cabinets or cabinet doors , and you 'll want to find a cabinet door that you like , or one that matches the others , that are already there .once you find the matching cabinet door , and you find it to the correct dimensions , then you want to bring it back. [CLS] [SEP]and you 'll want to mount your hardware on it , meaning your hinges. [CLS] [SEP], you do n't have to mount the knob yet , but you 'll want to mount the hinges .so what you do , is you measure from the top and the bottom , two inches , and that 's where you 'll want the new hinges to be .so , in this situation , you know , i have a hinge here. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's , it mounts to the cabinet door , on the inside of the door , and it mounts to the cabinet flange on the outside .so , what you 'll do is you 'll measure two inches down. [CLS] [SEP], you 'll put the hinge on the back of the door , and you 'll screw your hinge into the door , on the top and the bottom , two inches from the top , two inches from the bottom , then you 'll hold the cabinet door into place and line it up with the other cabinet doors in your cabinet , and once you get it lined up. [CLS] [SEP]and it looks level and everything , then you can pop a screw in the outside flange here and here , on the top and on the bottom , and that 's how you hang a cabinet door .my name 's ryan parker with parker home renovations and you can visit me at parkerhomerenovations.com .
so start a motion with arms open , legs bent and whenever the arms go back. [CLS] [SEP]the legs go back .okay ,so arms open , legs bent ,arms close. [CLS] [SEP]and you show up the wall .
this can cause a lot of damage when your hair is growing out because it causes a lot of tangling and when you want to remove them , it causes a lot of breakage because it becomes very matted by the roots .now , the way i do it is i create very nice precise rows across the back of the head all the way up into the front .as you can see they 're very defined , when you go home. [CLS] [SEP]you know exactly where the extensions are located .this makes it easier for you to care for your hair when it comes to brushing and flat irons and curling irons are very important because people do n't know where they are located if they are not like this and they will put the flat iron directly on their hair and it will melt them right out .so by doing it in this fashion it is easier for you to locate these in the back of your head and be able to care for them properly .
and i 'm a fitness trainer and running coach .today i want to talk with you about how to start a running program if you are a beginning runner .one of the first things you want to do is make sure you have a really good pair of running shoes. [CLS] [SEP]and i suggest you talk to a running specialist at a specialty running store so that person can help fit you with the proper shoe .now if you are just starting out , you have no experience in terms of knowing how to run or how long to run .my suggestion to you is that you start off with. [CLS] [SEP]maybe say twenty minutes of easy , slow , jogging every other day .so you would start off on a monday with twenty minutes of easy jogging .tuesday would be an off day .another twenty minutes of easy jogging on wednesday .thursday is an off day .run on friday .saturday is an off day and then sunday run twenty minutes , maybe twenty-five minutes on sunday .now this is a program you want to keep up say for maybe three weeks and then start gradually increasing your time. [CLS] [SEP]maybe say three to four minutes per run when you are running every other day .so once you get to your fourth week , you may start running say twenty-four minutes every other day .now as you start to continue with your running program , you want to integrate other aspects of training such as maybe some weight training , maybe getting in some interval training on the trike , it depends on what you 're training for .but if you 're just starting out , you 're a total beginner and you want to learn how to get into a regular running program. [CLS] [SEP], my suggestion is that you start with at least twenty minutes every other day and then gradually increase the amount of time that you are running as you feel more comfortable .if you would like to learn more how to start a running program as a beginner , please contact me at harvellfitnesstraining.com .that 's h a r v e l l fitness training.com .
 , we are going to need a foundation to match the skin , we are going to need our stipple sponge , our cosmetic sponge our eye shadows that we were using in a previous series .what we are doing , once again i 'll reiterate that we are not using any of the cream base were going to do some , use some tools that you can use from home out of your own make up kit .such as like your own eye shadow and you can shave off the eye shadow and get a basic moisturizer. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'll show you how do that later. [CLS] [SEP]but this is what we are going to start with now .you need some regular loose powder and i believe that 's it .so let 's get started .
i 'm an illustrator with larser arts and. [CLS] [SEP]today i thought i would talk about how we actually clean an airbrush gun when you are done with the piece .i just did this t-shirt awesome because airbrushing is awesome .what we do is the first thing you do. [CLS] [SEP]is you take either a cleaner which is an airbrush cleaner that they sell and also if you are dealing with a car cleaner what you do when working with it. [CLS] [SEP]you have to take mineral spirits like a paint thinner. [CLS] [SEP]and today i worked with a water based stuff. [CLS] [SEP]so we are going to use the cleaner that comes with the paints but put it in this tube. [CLS] [SEP]and you take your airbrush needle that you have. [CLS] [SEP]and you unscrew it. [CLS] [SEP]and you pull back on it .you have to take it out also and wipe it off on a cloth so you can get all of that off of there .once it is all clean and you look at it and make sure the tip is still looking good. [CLS] [SEP]you go back in and put it back in there and brush it on again and finish emptying out everything out of your tube .i do n't want to drop that .when you are done with that you take everything apart. [CLS] [SEP]and you put it in another jar with cleaning liquid , with say maybe this liquid or maybe hot soapy water if you are doing a water soluble .so you take everything apart and pull this out , unscrew this and take your tip out by unscrewing everything. [CLS] [SEP]and yet you 'll be able to find all that on your instruction manual when you buy your airbrush gun .they also have pipe cleaners that you can use to be able to clean out your airbrush gun. [CLS] [SEP]so when you are done you can put your pipe cleaner in there and rub it out where all the paint is stuck in here .so that gives you more of an idea of how to clean out your airbrush gun and if you have any other questions just always refer to your manual on it. [CLS] [SEP]but i always encourage everybody to have a good time and do n't worry about the cleaning process because look at what results you can get out of airbrushing .hope you enjoyed it .my name is lars robinson with larser arts .
we 're doing some potting of mexican honeysuckle .it 's native to texas easy to grow from root cuttings and things like that .but you got to have soil. [CLS] [SEP]so we 're going to talk about potting soils in general. [CLS] [SEP], there 's a couple of different kinds that i have .i have one that is called a premium grade which has no soil in it. [CLS] [SEP], it has no actual dirt it has peat moss. [CLS] [SEP]and it has organic matter , composted plants .this is not the finest grade. [CLS] [SEP]but it 's what i use. [CLS] [SEP]and i call it a premium grade .there is a cheaper variety which has a lot of dirt in it , it has a quite a bit of organic matter and stuff like that. [CLS] [SEP]but it works pretty well .the main difference between the two of them is that the high organic or the no soil is a lot lighter when you start talking about pot plants and stuff like that , that you 're going to move around or plants that are in flats that you may be selling or something like that .in house plants they get moved into areas that get the right sunlight or get the right temperature more quickly moved in if there is a frost coming and more likely they would be moved into a sunny window if they needed .the potting soil with dirt in it gets heavy and therefore it might not be as easy to move it around therefore. [CLS] [SEP]the plants may not get the best of care .
we 're kicking out out of our back one and a half .we are almost done with the kick out .we just talked about the legs and how to use them keeping tight stomach muscles .now , what do we do with our arms , our head , and our upper body on the kick out , okay .here 's what you do. [CLS] [SEP]: remember , in a nice pike. [CLS] [SEP]we 've got our arms wrapped up up under our legs , okay .as we begin to kick out we 're going to unfold our body , okay .as we unfold our body we 're going to unlock our hands from under our legs , okay .as we unfold and unlock , we bring our hands out , around our knees , and close them right here by our waist , okay .watch that again .i 'm in a nice pike. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm coming out of my dive , i unlock my hands , grab my hands here at my waist , okay .now , from there , i continue to unfold until i 'm straight .here my hands travel up my body , past my head , my head follows , my eyes and my hands are hitting the water .and that 's how i kick out .
hi , today we 're talking about how to pick out a healthy parakeet .so if you wanted a parakeet and you want to make sure that you 've got certain things , you want bright eyes , they should be chirping , they should seem lively , interested in what you are doing .they should have , you know their seer which is their nose should look clear .they should n't seem like they have any respiratory problems .their feet and nails should look clean and without any scaling .their tail feathers should be long and bright .they should look just overall they should seem active .if the bird is sitting on the perch fluffed up uninterested , all the other birds are flying around and. [CLS] [SEP]this one 's like ahh. [CLS] [SEP]he looks so sweet. [CLS] [SEP]cause he is just sitting there , that bird is not in good shape and you do n't want to pick out that bird .you want to make sure that you get your bird from a healthy source to begin with .generally private breeders are the best .they seem to have the smallest amount of influx of disease .a lot of times pet stores or high density breeders will end up with so many animals that it 's hard to worry about quality control. [CLS] [SEP]so a lot of these birds will have mites on their legs or end up with other help problems from a high density environment .these birds kept in very large flocks end up stressed out and diseased because of the high density environment. [CLS] [SEP]so if you can get one from a source that is just you know , a smaller , a small time breeder that seems to care for the birds carefully that 's generally a good way to make sure that you are getting a healthy animal .
alright , so now we have all our pots planted and where do we put them , what kind of light do they need ?generally i would put the cactus in the sunniest window , probably like a south facing window , they 're going to want a lot of sun .these fleshier leaves are , in nature , they 're around more water. [CLS] [SEP]so they 're a little more tolerant of lower light .they would take full sun , but if you had them in an east window they would grow just fine , too .so , either or .these plants , because they like so much light , you could grow them inside or out .i would probably get them rooted a little better before i put them outside , but they would grow just fine on your patio or on the window sill .of course , when it got a little cooler you would have to bring them inside because in massachusetts they 're not hard and they would definitely die on the first frost .so , if you hear there 's a frost you 'd have to take them in right away .
i see that there are three category of writers .i define them as being an author , a writer , and a story teller .an author , i like to classify as somebody who writes great works of literature .these are the well-known authors of our time and our past .then , there is the writer .i see that a writer is somebody who has an incredible command of mechanics of the english language .then , you get the third class , which is were i like to put myself which is a storyteller .somebody who conveys a story and a message and information to people in the form of a story in such a way in that it captivates them , it entertains them , it influences them , and it makes them want to turn the page to see what happens next .that is the real differences between those three as i see them .
also we 're going to use a gold or light topaz color .in this bead what we 'll be doing is using again , the black for the base. [CLS] [SEP]and , we 'll be using a series of dots to create an effect that looks like a harlequin pattern .these beads can be done in any color variations , but in order to suit the mardi gras festivity colors better , the topaz , the green , and the emerald are really probably the way to go .i 've seen these done in cocoa colors ; i 've seen them done in reds .basically , pretty much as with any bead style , you can do a variation of colors ranging from anything from more neutral colors to the brighter colors .and today , we 're going to use the ones that i 've chosen .
now , when you look at reducing the amount of dust in your home , the first areas you might want to consider , are actually the exterior to your home .keeping walkways and garages , keeping those swept and keeping those clean , keeping driveways and sidewalks and entrances to your home , keeping those swept , and keeping those pressure washed , and as clean as possible , and doing that periodically , it will keep you from tracking a lot of that to the interior of the house .now , and depending on the conditions , and the environment you live in , despite all the exterior cleaning that you do , and periodic maintenance you can do , you 're still going to get dust , so the next best defense , is actually in your return air filter , and as you look at this filter , this is actually a pleated , a high efficiency filter , and what this does , this is designed to actually collect a lot of the dust , that may come into your house , so. [CLS] [SEP]i would highly recommend using those pleated filters , and changing those out , every two to three months , depending on your type of environment .now , in particular type times of the year , if it tends to be drier and dusty around the house , then you may actually want to keep your fan in an on position .what this will do , is it will keep your fan on running , it will keep circulating the area , and it will allow those high efficiency filters , to draw more of that dust out of the air , and that 's opposed as the auto position , where the fan only comes on if you 're actually heating or cooling , so i 'm tim gipson , and that 's some tips on how to reduce dust in your home .
 , we are going to know learn retreat and seal .so starting with the position of the last punch , remember you are sinking the weight into both legs ,left leg is bent .most of your weight is on your left , core strength , strong arms .you are going to go ahead and punch a little bit longer with that right hand as the palm comes up , twisting the spine and the waist , left hand under right elbow .twist the spine and the waist again in the other direction as you start to sit back .right hand over left elbow .sitting back in to your legs , hands come right about to chest level , turn the palms .and you ?re going to start to shift the weight forward again back to the left as you push .this push has a little different trajectory then the pushes we 've done in the past .this one has the fingers pointing forward .so just imagine in martial arts , this is where you would go for the person 's throat .now i 'm going to show a little bit quicker and a little bit smoother .so from the punch , retreat and seal and push .
in this case uke is going to take a stance and is going to attack nage .okay , in this case , as soon as uke picks up his hand to attack , nage , irimi enters to the front straight in .let 's show them that again , and the most important part of this movement is that you catch it really early before the arm comes down .in aikido we do n't want to have a collision .
and we 're looking at the length. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're also looking at where on the bar it occurs .so that would be like a regular t right there .now you might have someone with a very highly placed stem or low stem or you might have someone with a very short stem or a very long stem .so all of these things are what factor in and what that represents is a person 's self esteem and self confidence .as you can see from this page right here , there are many different ways of doing the t bar crossing and the t stems .not only the lengths and the height of the t bar , but also. [CLS] [SEP]sometimes you 've got something like this where its doing a funny little crossover like that and extra loops and loops by the way we 'll get onto that later .they indicate sensitivity generally .and here there are even more t bar crossings of all different types .sometimes they might slant down or up .they might have loops within them .they might be wavy .and so we 're also looking at the i dot .alright here. [CLS] [SEP]you can see the very different types of i dots .so the i dot represents attention to detail .obviously if you have the dot right over the i , that means you are very meticulous .if you have the i dot flying out ahead of the i , that would seem to indicate that you 're impatient , hasty , want to get things done and the opposite of that would be someone with the i dot before the i like that .that 's someone who might be a little bit holding back on getting things done .and then the dot itself can also be formed in different ways as i think we mentioned before it could be made like a little circle , which would indicate someone with a bit of an artistic flair .or it could be a wavy line and that indicates humor .or it could be a dash which indicates impatience .
now on the prosumer level cameras and the higher end of the consumer line , they have a two level switch that is where you push the button to take the picture .you could push it half way , and it will focus .and then you press it the rest of the way and it will shoot .and when this camera does it , it shoots out sort of a red focusing light that 's got infrared built into it so that it can see it even in the dark .it 'll be able to focus .and this camera will take a picture in complete darkness and give a complete expert exposure .and most of them will do that .other things that are important are a manual focus so you can manually focus .and most prosumers have that , very few consumer cameras have that .
okay , in this first clip i just want to teach you or show you the proper ways to get started before we start the project .okay , before we even get started even talking about staining or whitewashing , you might want to have a big area to work in , or at least an area that you do n't make a mess .alright , so clean out some areas , move some furniture and put down your tarp , and that 's where you 're going to have your work area .you might also want to have an old work bench .something that you do n't mind if it gets dirty or out of place .and remember also : always wear old clothes .throw on some old jeans , some sneakers .good project for the kids to get them involved , too .so this is about just painting , having fun , but remember these are some harsh chemicals sometimes. [CLS] [SEP]so you 're going to want to open some windows and have some good cross-ventilation .today i 'm going to show you a little bit about everything when it comes to this project , and we 're going to have a lot of fun .so come back and join me as we 're going to start to stain and whitewash the armoire furniture .
i do celebrate espats and sabbaths .which an espat would be a full moon , so i do a full moon ceremony where i thank the goddess that i 've worked with for almost twenty years , for her help during the month .and that is just her day , i do not ask for anything as money , or love or health .it is just specifically to honor her .on the sabbaths , which are major holidays , there are eight in a year .it 's a little more intricate type of ritual , because you go with the time of the year that it is .so say if it was mid summer , i would decorate my altar with alot of flowers and probably throw a few faeries in there just because , and go from there .the theme would have summer colors to it , i would be wearing lighter clothing , because i do wear clothing .i do not go sky clad , which means naked .there have been times that i have , although i really watched to make sure the neighbors were n't peeking over the back fence .so i kind of stopped that , especially since there 's a child nextdoor. [CLS] [SEP]and i do n't want to damage them for the rest of their life .as far as the espats go , every one is different , every altar is decorate different .and that 's pretty much all i can say on that .as far as everyday life , nature is in everyday , it comes into play .i 'm thankful for the changes in weather. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm thankful for the stars at night .these are the types of things we watch .it 's a nature based religion .so as the world turns , so do our lives , so does the wheel .
and the next thing i wanted to talk about was your combination passes .now you can start to get really creative with these now that you have gotten control of your double back handsprings and your back tucks .you can start really doing any combination that you can think of .the first that i would recommend is your double back handspring back tuck .the same problems as before , you want to make sure you 're seeing it as one , one tumbling pass , not all this separate tricks that goes into it .keeping the rhythm with it , remembering and paying attention to your head and hand positions , making sure that those are where they should be .and just making sure you 're getting controlling your power .this is a really big problem i see as people move on to harder combinations .they start going and build up a really big momentum , and they 'll just fly up in the air and they do n't know how to control that much power .so you need to make sure you 're taking it slow , not going too advanced or too fast .keeping it under your control , really paying attention to all the proper techniques .as you start doing these combinations , thinking up of your own passes to do , you need to keep in mind what we talked at the beginning , the mental set .you need to make sure you 're really thinking about what you 're going to do before you do it .organizing it in your mind , and knowing what you do , so that you do n't get half way through it and still wonder well what am i doing .you need to make sure that 's under your control , you know what you 're doing so that you can really pay attention to your body .especially your head position as you are throwing all of these different movements , and they 're requiring your head to go every which way .so it 's important to organize that mindset , pay attention to your positions , especially your head and your hands .and really think about it as you are doing these combinations .
and in the cave , which is pretty interesting , is there were thirteen figures .there was a man who had antlers on , there was a pregnant female , and eleven people around them .now what this translates to would be the god and the goddess , and eleven followers , or a coven .and the goddess is normally shown pregnant because she stands for fertility .and the god , which i have an example , of kernunos , who is the horned god , or the hunter , he is shown with the antlers .and also sometimes you will see him dancing .i know it 's a really tiny picture , and stuff .and normally you 'll see him nude , and people figure he 's barbaric or whatnot .and normally they will show him with an erect fallace , showing that he is also part of the fertility , a hunt .and , i do n't know .there was a cave. [CLS] [SEP]and i ca n't remember if it was in france or not .i believe it was in france ,where they had another horned god figure that was found on a wall .and archaeologists are finding things every day .they 've found crystals , they 've found parts of brooms and stuff .well brooms everybody used anyway .but still , they are trying to piece together these things and shamanic type huts .
in addition to silver foil you can find silver comes in several forms .this thin piece of silver is what is called silver bezel .it can be applied to a bead , or it can be applied to a piece of pyrex or a piece of quartz , to use in a fuming technique which i 'll show you later .basically you can use again a pair of regular scissors to cut the size of bezel that you need .silver also comes , wow , that 's pretty sticky .silver also comes in a leaf form which is a very , very fine form .also comes in wire , you can use a silver wire to wrap around your bead .in addition to silver there are other metals that you can use when you 're making glass beads .you can use gold leaf , which of course is more expensive , or you can even use palladium .also , you can use copper , and you can use copper wire , in order , when you heat copper up. [CLS] [SEP]it turns a ruby red color , and will transfer that effect and the oxidation of those metals will affect the colors of your base glass .
what we are going to discuss and demonstrate is the simple technique to tying the butterfly knot .the butterfly 's purpose is to form a locking loop in the middle of any rope .the butterfly knot can take the place of a figure eight on a bite or the bowline on a bite .to form the butterfly knot we simply lay the rope across the palm of our hand and we are going to wrap or form three loops around our palm to the inside of that first wrap .we form the first one to the inside and hold it , we form the second one to the inside of the first two and hold it .then we grab the middle one lift it , cross over the most inner one and then pass that through the whole that we formed and pull that tight until we form what 's called a butterfly knot .to finish off the knot we simply pull it and pop the knot to where we have what looks like two wings , it 's self locking forming the butterfly knot .this can be attached to any object or anchor point , taking the place of the figure eight on the bite , or the bowline on the bite .great knot to know in addition to those two knots .the butterfly knot .
okay .now , we 're going to go over on how to catch your nunchuck. [CLS] [SEP], okay ?so , instead of going like this and grabbing it and putting it together like that , okay ?instead of looking sloppy , we 're going to put it all the way together to make it look real sharp , do a nice fine catch .a catch like that , bam !okay .let 's get to the practice down here .when you do it , just practice -- bam -- catching it , okay ?so , let 's go ahead and breakdown how to catch it. [CLS] [SEP], okay ?so , we 're going to stand here sideways , hold your nunchuck down like this .now , you have to be careful not to pinch your thumb , okay ?so , i 'm going to hold it with my thumb and my first finger ,okay ?and now , i 'm going to just toss it on gently and just. [CLS] [SEP]practice catching it .when it comes here , my whole hand grips , okay ?so , when i 'm pinching it , i 'm leaving this whole palm and my nunchuck open .i will go around , flip and catch ,okay ?now , you do it from the topside .from here , you come down , catch .one more time , catch , catch , catch , okay ?so , it 's very important that you 'll be able to catch your nunchuck from different directions ,okay ?be able to catch it from the top , from the side , the other side , okay ?the bottom , okay ?this way , okay ?practice catching your nunchuck in all different angles. [CLS] [SEP]so you 'll never have a hard time .wherever you want to start , you can catch your nunchuck .
i 'm going to talk to you about time budgeting in your home video post-production studio .time is money as i said before .time budgeting is very important , especially when it comes to distractions .when you 're budgeting your time , you want to make sure that you 're not overextending yourself or putting in way too many hours on a project where you 're only contractually obligated to put in a certain amount .it 's very easy to get involved on a project , especially in an industry like this which is creative by nature .as an editor , it 's very easy to spend two , three , five hours on ten to twenty seconds of video , but when the client is expecting a full video which is going to be three minutes in length , you 've already used up too much time on a little portion and now you 're going to have to really rush through the rest of your project .this means you could be sacrificing the quality , the pacing , and the overall look of the video by the end .and the ultimate goal , obviously , is to impress them and leave them wanting more so they 'll call you up for the next job again .time budgeting is one of the most difficult things to get your head around , and it does take a lot of personal experience and at least one or two or three projects with one specific client to really know what you 're in for .i would make estimates very liberally so that if you get things done ahead of schedule , you feel like you accomplished something , and you got it done ahead of time , and now you know for the next time .
indoor rock climbing gym , in wilmington , north carolina .today , we 're going to discuss , stretching your rock climbing shoes .stretching a rock climbing shoe , for the most part , is not a possibility .breaking your climbing shoe in properly , may be something that you 're looking to do .climbing shoes are aggressively tight .generally , you 're going to have a rock climbing shoe. [CLS] [SEP], that 's one or one and a half sizes smaller , than your normal shoe .in a rock climbing shoe , you want your toes to come right to the front .you want a little bit of curl in your toe .you do n't want your toes , to really be able to move , inside of a shoe .the less movement you have , the more aggressive the shoe is going to be , while you 're climbing , the better it 's going to hold , on to small footholds .if you 're trying to break your shoe in , and you 're having problems , one of the things that you can do , is put them on , step into your bathtub , get your shoe soaking wet , and then walk around with them , until they dry .this will help to make the shoe form to your foot .not generally stretching it , but getting it to where it fits properly .lots of different types of shoes .the velcro shoe is going to be easier to break in , than a lace up with a leather top .again , this has been , stretching your rock climbing shoe .
when you ’ ve taken eddy hopping to the limit , as far as you ’ re willing to push it and as far as you ’ re willing to uh , feel like you have safety downstream , its time to get out and scout from shore .and that ’ s a way to look at a rapid , you can get out and actually walk along the bank of the river and look at the rapid that you are about to run or maybe you decide not to run and really get a lot of good information about the rapid , about what ’ s coming up , the hazards and all that .scouting from shore requires a couple of things .number one , it requires you to be conservative enough and to be , uh , have good enough judgment to decide to scout from shore and not just sort of take every rapid as they come .some boaters paddle that way and that ’ s how you can get into big trouble , is not knowing when to scout .the second thing it requires is a shore that you can get to , some rapids are in vertical side gorges , very difficult , to nearly impossible to scout from shore .and it that case , unless you are a real expert , probably the judgment there is just to , to portage around the whole section and not even consider it .but in cases where you have a good access to the shore and you can see the rapid well , uh , what you want to do , is just walk down the shore , as you ’ re going down , look for hazards , look for routes , look for ways down the rapids , that maybe avoid those hazards .often there will be one or two really major issues in the rapid that you have to watch out for. [CLS] [SEP]and you have to kind of identify those early and think of your routes and ways that you can avoid those hazards and that can allow you to have a smooth run through the rapid .a couple of rules of thumb for scouting from shore , number one is , rapids are always bigger when you get down to them than they are from shore , so especially if you ’ re scouting from forty , fifty , eighty , one hundred feet above the river , um , the rapids going to look a lot smaller at that , from that point of view , than it will when you ’ re actually in it .when you ’ re paddling through it those waves that looked like they were three to four feet high , might be eight or ten feet high and the drops that looked like they were two or three feet high might be eight or ten , or twelve or fifteen feet high in fact .you can ’ t generally see vertical uh , you know , vertical dimensions scouting from above a rapid. [CLS] [SEP]so it ’ s often very deceiving .it ’ s not a bad idea to go down to the river level and especially on the way back up after you ’ ve seen the rapid. [CLS] [SEP]and you know what you ’ re looking at and if you decide to run it , to go back down to the river level and try to scout right down at the river level , try to get down low. [CLS] [SEP]where , from the point of view you ’ ll see from the boat and actually check out what the view lines are going to be like , what you ’ re going to be able to see , what you ’ re going to be able to distinguish , sometimes we pick , uh , points to , to key off of , sometimes it ’ s a wave , sometimes a rock , a tree , something like that and. [CLS] [SEP]some of those points are visible from the boat when you get down to them , but sometimes those points disappear when you get to the boat and what seemed obvious from up above is completely hard , difficult to figure out from down below .so uh , make sure that those are still distinguishable when you get down to the river .and in general you know , when in doubt , scout .
we 're here in wasatch , the beautiful wasatch mountains of utah .here to talk about adaptive sports .and how snowshoeing can fit in with a lot of people 's adaptive life .okay , in snowshoeing , much like snow skiing being able to stop is very important .and not being able to stop is intimidating .so , when you get to the top of a hill , or your coming to the edge of someplace and you want to stop .it 's always important if you 're walking or jogging at a pretty good pace , that like anything you want to shorten the steps to decelerate .and the shorter you do that , and also be aware of over lapping .then they can come to more of a stop .as opposed to the longer strides .it 's harder to come to a stop when you are taking longer strides .so it 's really just a , kind of a down shifting so to speak .but also being aware of the over lap .cause you do n't want to have them trip , especially if their coming to the edge of a creek or something like that .
now one of the neatest things that you can do with this instrument is circular breathe .that 's actually buzzing while breathing in through your nose and playing at the same time .right now , we 'll go over the basics of how to do that .first of all , while you 're buzzing into the instrument and you begin to run out of breath .i 'd say you had about a quarter of your lung capacity left .you want to fill your cheeks with air , close off your throat and while you do , puff the air out of your cheeks while you 're playing .not with your hands , but while you 're playing the instrument , and breathe in through your nose in short bursts as you puff the air out of your cheeks .let 's give this a try with just a basic monotone through the didgeridoo so you can get an idea of what it looks like .( demo ) notice the long duration that i was able to play this thing and. [CLS] [SEP]the short air sounds that you heard coming in through my nose .in a traditional didgeridoo recording you 're going to hear those sounds .it 's actually part of the character of the instrument .let 's try that once more , but a little bit faster .( demo )that is circular breathing .
the stylist or the service provider know what they 're going to be doing on the client , what the client 's doing , the time of the service .this would be the client name here and all of this is a list that the client has previously purchased .down here on the bottom is going to be a list of say the color formulation that was used the last time , the type of cutting technique that was used , even the polish color .we like to write all of that down and keep a great record of that so that we can duplicate it for the next time that the client comes back into the salon .watch our next segment on delivery. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to talk a little more in depth on how to fill out your client ticket .
remember how to do your legs , your right legs go back and before it hits the ground you alternate with your left leg and make sure that when either leg goes back it goes right behind the other .and always remember you will have your own style no matter what kind of dance you do .like this for instance the roger rabbit , i have my own style for this dance , now every person does n't do it the same. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's your signature move .
i just want to talk a little bit about half pipe safety .half pipes are definitely the most popular feature of any park .obviously with the olympics being big and x-games being real big everybody wants to jump right into the pipe .it is really important though just to scope out the scene before you drop in , once you arrive to the half pipe you can take a look around and see how many people are waiting to drop in , who is going next ,who looks like they know what they are doing. [CLS] [SEP], how close do you want to drop in to another person .there is a lot of factors you got to pay attention to .so it is a really good idea to just chill out at the top for a second and scope out the scene .be aware of what is going on around you , who is dropping in and who is getting ready to drop in next .make sure that everybody around you when you are ready to drop in knows that you are ready to drop in. [CLS] [SEP]so we do not have collisions inside of the pipe .it is pretty much one of the scariest things. [CLS] [SEP]so just ride a safe style and get it done .
how do you tell if your hermit crab is pregnant ?you ca n't .that 's a simple answer .hermit crabs , unfortunately , we do n't understand how they breed , we do n't understand how they reproduce , the environmental conditions , the various needs , things like that .we ca n't even tell if they 're pregnant .there 's no way to know .and if your hermit crab does happen to get pregnant , by some bizarre way or reason , you 'll probably never even know .and , you 'll never be the wiser .because hermit crabs have to lay their eggs , he 's going to come out for me here .hermit crabs have to lay their eggs in the ocean .they 're so microscopic that they feed on micro nutrients in the surf .we ca n't provide that , so .honestly , there 's no way to tell if your hermit crab is pregnant , and you 'll never be the wiser .so , just enjoy your hermit crab for what he is , and do n't worry about it .
in this clip , we 're going to do the third progression of shomaplutachari .and that step , it 's similar --it has similar elements to the first two .first we 're going to jump , then we 're going to step , shomo , and jump to the same side again , and then hop .so we 're going to jump , shomo , jump , hop .one , two , three , four , one , two , three , four .the hands are going to do the windshield motion again , but as you step , they go back to the same side .so , one , two , and then again , three and stay .one , change , change , stay .so on the hop , you 're not going to switch your hands again .you 're going to keep your hands on this side .so it 's only one , two , three changes in the hands .six , seven , eight .
now , i 'm going to show you some reasons why your saxophone wo n't play .first of all , i 'll start off with our neck and our neck octave mechanism here .this is probably the biggest reason for your horn not playing .basically , if this key up here is leaking whatsoever , the rest of your horn is going to play off .it will actually , will not play at all .some other things that can cause your horn not to play is you could have some bent keys , you can have just a pad that is just flat worn out where the leather has broke away. [CLS] [SEP]and there 's just felt , and the pad is leaking .we also could have some kind of a trauma , in some way , drop it , any of these tall posts here could be dented into the body , make any pads leak .there are quite a few things that will make your instrument not play , those were a few of them .
now let 's dive right into the second measure of the eight line right here .starts off with b , slurs , second position , shift , right up , and now let 's take a look at my hands , so it shifts , to second position at the g sharp right on up and it is a very , it is just a half step away shift .
a honeydew is so good when it 's riped , okay .first thing you want to do with is smell it. [CLS] [SEP], you want to make sure that it has very aromatic smell , a very fruity smell .if it does not have a fruity smell. [CLS] [SEP]do not buy it , you want to buy the one that has the most fruitiest smell which this one does .now this honeydew has a nice light yellow flush which is perfect , you do n't want to see any type of real dark spots .you want to feel it and make sure it 's firmed all the way around ,no dents , no soft spots and you can also do like the watermelon and thump it .it needs to have a real nice deep thump .this one has that .again guys , smell your honeydew , look at it make sure there 's no bruising , soft spots and you want to thump it .you 'll definitely get a nice honeydew every time if you follow those steps .now you ca n't smell the watermelon. [CLS] [SEP]but you can smell the honeydew. [CLS] [SEP]and that is the most important thing. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to stress that again guys , smell your honeydew when you get there .same thing with all the other melons. [CLS] [SEP]you should be able to smell them , this one smells so delicious. [CLS] [SEP]i know. [CLS] [SEP]it 's ready to eat .hope you guys pick good honeydews in the future , i hope this video helped you out a little bit better , be confident when you 're choosing your produce guys. [CLS] [SEP]cause you do n't want to waste your money .thank you .
it is x and a red , much like blaze .however , fireball is a little different .fireball is a sorcery , but you may pay the x damage and have it deal to a single creature or play .however , fireball has the extra added thing that you may deal damage to multiple targets .so you would divide that damage evenly among the targets , but you also have to pay one additional colorless mana for each additional target .so , if you were targeting two things you would have to pay one colorless and the red , and then you would start counting mana for the x. [CLS] [SEP]likewise with two , three , and so forth .but , you 've also got to realize that that x divided evenly , rounded down amongst the number of targets .
alright , we 're talking about auto focus modes here with the canon 40d .and the first auto focus mode that we want to talk about is the one shot mode .to get to that mode here , again we 're going to select the af-drive button and then scroll through to one shot .and the one shot mode , basically , is primarily for still subjects .and what you 'll want to do is take your camera and go ahead and focus it .focus the camera on or aim the camera at your subject , press the shutter button down and the camera will pull a focus on that item on the subject .and once the camera has pulled a focus , what you can do is recompose the shot .maybe you want to move the subject off to the right or to the left to give it better perspective or more natural perspective and that focus will be locked and it 's not going to change .so one shot is primarily for relatively still objects or still photography and achieves a locked focus one time , until you initiate another focus by pressing the shutter button once again .
now lastly , you want to make sure that you have your cleaning products in a safe place .before i get started with cleaning here , i just want to lastly explain to you .how important that is .you know , how important that is .those of you , who have young children .who can get into cupboards .you want to make sure that your products are always up high , in the cupboard somewhere .if you do n't have storage up high , to put your hold , your holder like this .then make sure , you either have those locks .that come around your handles on lower cupboards .so that children can not get into them .but you want , there 's also some where they have the round knobs .that go onto door handles .if you do n't have them close enough together , that you can put the hooks around them .but any kind of locks , any kind of lock .you want to make sure , if you 're stirring your chemicals , down low .make sure you have those safety precautions .also it 's a good idea to have poison control number , somewhere close to hand .for any kind of emergency .i would definitely recommend , you know what that poison control number is .and where to find that in emergency .and as far as the child locks , you can get them at toy r us .pretty much target , places like that .for a few dollars .
now you can also get into some specialty grinders .this tormek is a very good unit .it is what they call a slow speed grinder or a wet grinder .there is usually water in this area here .this tool. [CLS] [SEP]i have one in my shop. [CLS] [SEP], i love it , i love it for my playing irons , my chisels , more of my carving tools .my turning tools , i tend to usually go with my bench grinder .i feel it is a little bit faster. [CLS] [SEP]but the tormek is a very good system on that. [CLS] [SEP]and so if you 've got one of these. [CLS] [SEP]they 've got some great jigs. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's real easy to use and get set up .but we 'll be mainly talking about this bench grinder on that .now as far as grinding once we have got our grinder. [CLS] [SEP]and we 've got our wheels on here the next most important thing. [CLS] [SEP]is probably a diamond dresser .a diamond dresser works on the principle that we 've got to get these wheels flat. [CLS] [SEP]and we 've got to get them round and the diamond dresser also works to clean this out .every once in a while the tool will become loaded up and you need to clean it .most diamond dressers have industrial diamonds , sometimes a single point diamond dresser and in this case you 've got many little diamonds in here into a carbide matrix and this will last a lifetime .with that carbide and the diamond this will last a lifetime and it is very easy to use , you just drag it across the wheel on that .but once we get our grinder , we get it set up , we want to dress our wheels before we do any grinding .we just take it and hold it still on our tool rest and come across and that trues it up nice and quickly .the old star dressers you had to bounce the wheels , they just do n't work quite as quick .they certainly do work but just not as quickly and as nicely as this one .
what this has shown us is basically how to put a sky in and make the clouds form by using a paper towel to randomly place clouds in .also showed us how we can grow a forest with just two or three colors and grow it up to the sky using wet and wet processes .and we can make planking with vertical holes so to speak to gives a suggestion of vertical wood and more wet and wet with a couple of colors in here ; character in the fence and then scrape marks for the snow that 's covering the tops of these fence posts .and then to put some more interest rather than having a big white area , we put just the most subtle violets down here in a wet and wet arrangement which started out just as clear water with a little bit of brown in it. [CLS] [SEP]and then we added just the barest hints of your cobalt blue and permanent rose which produce a subtle lavender style violet .
so the next ting that we are going to do is we are going to apply some bronzer .i am going to use my kabuki brush for this. [CLS] [SEP]so i am going to take a little bit .i am going to start at the bridge of the nose. [CLS] [SEP]brush it across her forehead .on the cheek bones .and the chin .you want to apply bronzer on the high points of the face which is exactly where we applied it before i had the nose , cheeks and the chin .because that is where son light naturally hits the face. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's were if you were getting a tan from the sun .that is were your would. [CLS] [SEP]naturally tan. [CLS] [SEP]anyway. [CLS] [SEP]so that 's where you want to concentrate your bronzer .you do n't want to put your bronzer all over the whole face because that does n't give any dimension to the face .so when you just concentrate it right to those high points it gives her a really even nice sun kissed look .with out looking like she tried to hard to look like she was out in the sun .or she caked on a lot of dark makeup to make her look like she had a tan .so it 's a really nice natural way to give yourself a sun kissed glow and. [CLS] [SEP]also to when you choose one you want toke. [CLS] [SEP]sure you choose one that 's going to match well with your skin tone and not look too dark .like she is more on the pale side .i am more on the pale side so when i choose a bronzer i want to make sure it 's not something that 's not going to make me look like i am super , super dark .because obviously i do n't tan that easily. [CLS] [SEP]and i do n't want to look like i tried to hard .so just keep that in mind when you ?re choosing a bronzer for yourself .so that 's how you would want to apply a bronzer if you to give yourself a sun kissed glow .
so when you do the sides , one thing you have to remember is no pressure to speak of .you 're going to feel like you 're just barely hitting the surface. [CLS] [SEP]but you 're not .you just do it , nice calm strokes that we 've talked about before .in human beings it 's called an eplorage stroke and that 's what you 're using on this .and you 're just going to go very slowly , this is a good time to notice lumps , here , here , you notice if it 's warm for some reason where it should n't be .what these strokes do down the sides of the animal is it helps to start stimulating the organs that are beneath the rib cage .and for older animals especially , it 's really good to kind of hit the chest area with this same sort of stroke because that helps to stimulate the heart .
alright. [CLS] [SEP]so , i mean this is perfectly fine vase. [CLS] [SEP]but it could be better .so i could stick my hand down there and pull up some lines. [CLS] [SEP]but i 'm not really feeling that ; i 'm going to use this. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to just take it down here. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'll do it there. [CLS] [SEP]so you can see , i 'm going to take it down there. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to pull it up like this ; o.k .and then i 'm going to go over to the other side ; i 'm going to do the same thing no problem just do n't go threw the clay , pull it up like this .and even that looks cooler than it did before , and you know what ?i was going to go with four. [CLS] [SEP]but i like the way that this is looking here with what i 'm going to do because we 're going to put some , some funny little handles on here. [CLS] [SEP]and i think with the way that it looks here ; it looks pretty good .you want to take a sponge ; clean up these edges here that got messed up from my tool , o.k .you want everything to deliberate and not like there was a mistake .so from here we can figure out what type of little handles will look good on there. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll just slap them on .
okay , so one of the other things to kinda keep in mind , what we did here is we just did , we recorded on a track-by-track basis , you can always record multiple tracks at a time so you could set it up to where you have one and two go and one being a vocal , one of them being a guitar .one thing you might run into if you 're tryin 'to lay down say two or three tracks with two or three people , as far as monitoring , you 're not going to want to use the speakers for that .it 's really just kinda good for playback where everybody can hear , you 're going to want to use the headphones. [CLS] [SEP]so you probably have to get a hold of some kind of a like a headphone ; i know they make them out there to where it 's kind of a splitter where you can actually basically have. [CLS] [SEP]like four people running off of one module and that module ties back into the system .we have a little thing kinda looks kinda like the eq kind of thing ; it 's just little knobs with levels and that kind of stuff. [CLS] [SEP]so if you go out any kind of guitar store or music rental gear house near you , you can always talk to them and definitely will be able to help you out .
what this would do it will allow you to see like here what you are going to need , what connectors you are going to use that should compliment your plants that you have already created .it just gives you a better visual sense and also helps you give you a schematically of what you are going to cut. [CLS] [SEP]and how much you might need as far as piping and where your problem area is particularly going to lye .here you could see there is some tree branches that we where concerned with and had to make some changes to go around. [CLS] [SEP]but if something is not clear , it is not deep enough , it might need to cut out some more of the dirt to create more of a adapt further down to meet needs of that actual sprinkler .then laying out the piping ahead of time that is one of the things it would do .here you could see we are about 6 inches deep and going against a little bit of the cement walk. [CLS] [SEP]way here this is actually a pretty good depth here and in the southern california area where we are using the plastic pvc piping and just given us this schematic of visually apprehending with the adjoining sprinkler head .this is a large sprinkler head that we are using in the backyard .here you can also see that the pvc piping is going to fit there perfectly and we are going to have many contours to deal as we are going to move forward and start installing the actually sprinklers and join the pvc piping together .
and this , it 's really important with the hands ,because it 's all we have to tell her with , is that we go here on 5 , all together , 5.and then here , i 'm really making sure that i 'm leading this right hand forward .so she knows she 's not traveling her weight back , because i 'm really kind of making it obvious that we 're really staying in place .so we 've gone here , then we can do the 5 again , then when it comes back , it 's coming back. [CLS] [SEP], it 's a forward bit , but kind of starting to travel back .`` yes .and the other thing for followers , we 're doing that kick back , notice it 's really largely a kick to the side , because he 's right back there , so just watch that part again . [CLS] [SEP]''what part , 5 ? `` yes . [CLS] [SEP]5 , and here. [CLS] [SEP]; now i 'm kicking a lot to the side , as oppose to straight back and into him . [CLS] [SEP]''thank you .okay , one last little bit. [CLS] [SEP]; i forgot what i was going to say .oh yeah , one of the things we mentioned in the earlier series when we taught it , is making sure that it does n't pivot from the top. [CLS] [SEP], it 's not a upper body tilting kind of thing , like , kick , kick ,kick .this is a really helpful skill to have , because if we did that now , we 'd whack ourselves .so the upper body is upright , and it 's really just going here , and going from the lower body .okay .good luck .
now we are going to finish our horse .holding it so that the sink fold is on the bottom , that 's the base of our horse , we are going to open the tail , the point that does n't have a little triangle folded down .open it up. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to do a swivel fold by pinching the base of the tail together. [CLS] [SEP]we are going to fold it at an angle down like so .this is a crimp fold , which swivel folds on both sides .this is a crimp fold with the tail .now for the tail to look like it 's flowing we are going to do an inside reverse fold out and do another inside reverse fold up .now you have a flowing horse tail .turn your unit to the other side and we are going to do a crimp fold with the head as well , same thing with the tail .same thing as we did with the tail do a crimp fold with the base of the head , swivel folds on both sides .now for the top of the head we are going to fold it down so that it looks like the head of the horse .fold it down at an angle , fold it down like this .this is our guiding crease .
to have a character , what you 'll need is a character sheet and dice to do the rolls that make up your character 's ability scores .once you have a character , someone will be elected as the dugeon master .that person will host the game and be the primary storyteller .you 'll go thu a story .lots of stuff can happen .you 'll have a chance to get a feel for your character. [CLS] [SEP]and you 'll probably get into a battle situation where you 'll have a chance to roll these bigger dice and find out if you character has what it takes to survive the dungeons and dragons world .after several battles and perhaps and dungeon crawl , you might fing yourself being rewarded with treasure and other such things such as credibility and fame in the world of dungeons and dragons as a result of successfully completing your first quest .so look forward to it and get out there and get a group together and start playing dungeons and dragons .
hi , i 'm les whitley .i 'd like to talk to you right now about building your abdominal muscles .the abdominal muscles , just like any other muscle in the body , requires training and effort .to train those abdominal muscles through a variety of ranges of motion for a complete and overall total development requires time focus and effort on your part .one of the main exercises that 's used is the crunch or the sit-up in a forward motion which trains the rectus-abdominus or the center portion of the abdominal muscles .the abdominal muscles are part of your overall core which involves your obliques as well as your lower back .for stabilization of your torso in all activities that you are doing .whether it 's walking , running , sitting , standing ; overall proper posture .the abdominal muscles and midsection should be trained appropriately using exercises that fit and meet your needs .training the midsection as a whole through functional exercises will give you an overall better stable environment to operate performing sports or just general daily activities .training that midsection together to operate as a whole and part of your overall body will give you the development for that overall toned midsection that everyone looks for .
lets put our ice in a glass here .we 're going to do a half of a shot of tequila .one half of a shot of triple sec .one half of a shot of southern comfort .which is some where around here .do n't quite have that yet .it 's alright. [CLS] [SEP]we 're going to skip to half of a shot of grenadine and a half of a shot of lemon juice .there we go .i found my southern comfort here it is .half of a shot of southern comfort. [CLS] [SEP]and finally we 're going to do about a half a shot of orange juice .there we go and lets go ahead and mix this up real good .very nice got it all blended together .get your glass .pour it and a straw .and there you go a blitz .bottoms up .
they should all be adding something to the organization .sometimes you 'll point board members because they 're very well connected in the community ; they have access to all sorts of resources that will help the theater .sometimes you put them on the board because they know a lot about theater. [CLS] [SEP]and they 've been very involved in theater .that 's how i got on the board here .sometimes you put them on the board because they 're very good at managing. [CLS] [SEP]and they 've got special skills or disciplines that the board really needs .accounting perhaps , law , or something like that .you want a variety of people on your board all when we 're adding something .then you want to have committee structure because there 's a lot of work to do in a community theater .you want to have a committee for example looking at the plays that are going to be selected for the next season .reviewing lots of scripts and making recommendations to the board about what plays to have .you want to have a committee involved with nothing but fund raising , because you need to keep that coordinated .in our case for example now , we 're going to be raising money to renovate this theater building that 's been given to us , but at the same time we 're going to be raising money for the underwriting of our productions .we do n't want to have different people approaching the same business or the same individual for money 2 or 3 times during the year for different purposes .that all has to be coordinated so that people do n't get tired of being approached .you 'll need to have committees for things like developing a strategic plan .once your theater is running , it 's very important that each stage of the game , at each major milestone that you 've set for yourself is an accomplishment like getting a building or getting a place to perform that 's reliable .you want to work in a strategic plan .this is our strategic plan .you get it all on one page if you can .it means you have to boil it down , make it very concise , but basically this is the guidance document that tells you what are we trying to accomplish in the next year .what are our major long-term objectives , that 's this column .what are near term goals , what are strategies for achieving these goals .we 're going to appoint this committee , we 're going to apply for membership in this organization and so on .then the last column , very important , the measures ; how are we going to measure our progress .for example , show attendance of 1 ,000 people by the fall of 2007 is one of our measures .season tickets sales of 250.certain key people in place , cash flow , being on budget , all that sort of thing .we have goals for the audience development , for building our audience , for the staff , for financial goals , our facilities , expanding our programs , and training and professionalism .these are the major areas we want to emphasize .at the top of the whole thing is a mission station that tells your organization and others what your organization is really trying to accomplish in the community .
there 's not a very good typical , it depends on the size of the firm , but basically for an average publicly traded firm , the compensation 's about seven million dollars a year .interesting sort of thing , when i have my executive mba class and. [CLS] [SEP]i ask how many of them want to be ceo 's , about three or four hands will go up .when i ask them how many people would like to make seven million dollars a year , of course all their hands go up .ceo 's have a huge earnings potential .there are stories in the paper and the sort of infamous ceo 's and the amount of monies that they make .you can literally make hundreds of millions of dollars in a year because your performance is based on the performance of the firm .your compensation is based on the performance of the firm .it depends entirely on the size of the firm .when i started my firm , i was earning about fifty thousand dollars a year. [CLS] [SEP]and i never worked that hard for the same salary ever .i mean the number of people who want to be ceo 's , the key to really the growth of the economy in the u.s. [CLS] [SEP]is entrepreneurship and the number of new firms or startups , so the number of new ceo 's are just astronomical in terms of its growth rate .
in this section we 're going to learn about the lydian mode which i bet you can guess ?is from f to f and remember you can transpose that by thinking about the relationships between , whether there 's half steps , half steps , half , a sorry .whole steps , whole steps , whole steps , half steps. [CLS] [SEP], whole step , whole step , half steps and. [CLS] [SEP]you can transpose that relationship anywhere .but let 's play a little tune in , in a , in the , in lydian mode. [CLS] [SEP]so i would do f in the base .i mean you ca n't really go wrong when you really think in scales .i mean just think about it in scales , stick to a scale , play outside the scale you ca n't go wrong .
we ’ re here to show you the basics of salsa .okay , now we ’ re going to work on an outside turn for the girl .now , this turn could also replace your cross body lead or your dile que. [CLS] [SEP]no .so men , if you don ’ t want to be doing dile que nos or cross body leads all the time , you could replace them with an outside turn .all we ’ re going to do is 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , forward and back .this is what it is , okay .now , the feet are the same for the men .i just lay the cross body lead .girls , what you ’ re going to do is you ’ re going to go back with the right .now , when you go forward , you go forward just the same way you did for you cross body lead .now , what you ’ re going to do is you ’ re going to get some momentum. [CLS] [SEP]so you can turn to the left .left , right , left , and you go back to your basic .one more time , so you ’ re going to do basic , forward , 2 , 3 , outside turn , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , forward and back .
the kids will love that .they always like making snakes .you want to roll it like a snake and then crunch it so that it 's nice and tight .you 're doing this because you 're going to use two of them , and you 're going to make kind of a chain with them so that the sound will filter through the two of them .there that 's about the right length .ok , we 're going to make another one .we 're going to roll it like a snake .of course , it does n't have to be even , because after all , you are just going to crunch it up .once we have it rolled we 're going to take the two. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to twist the tops together. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to make sure that we have an opening and an opening , and an opening , and an opening , and an opening , so that we have a chain .this we 're going to put inside of our rain stick and if you look at the end of it. [CLS] [SEP]and you say to yourself , that looks like there 's way too much room in there. [CLS] [SEP]and my filling is going to fall too fast and not make enough sound. [CLS] [SEP], you simply make another chain out of aluminum foil and put both of them in there .once you have as many in there as you feel that you need , you 're going to cap the end. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're ready to decorate your rain stick that has an aluminum foil sound filter .
okay , now we 've drained the coconut and here 's the coconut water .and so now we want to get inside this little guy and get the meat out .and the hole was pretty easy to find , and as you see , it did n't take a lot of effort .and this right now is , is probably about the , the most effort .now i use a hatchet .other people use meat cleavers .the most important thing is the safety .being that you have to hold this coconut while you do it , you want to make sure you do n't chop off any fingers .but what we 're going to do is we 're ,we see where the hole is. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to. [CLS] [SEP], we 're going to take this. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to give this coconut a good size crack to it and see what happens .okay , and then we 're going to hit it again , and hit it again .we 're starting to open it up .then we 're going to flip it over , right opposite where we hit it before , and we 're going to try to give it a crack on this side .and again , make sure your fingers are out of the way .we do n't want any accidents happening here .and so this is a very safety factor .always safety .so we 're going to hit it again .okay , now we split her open and we pull it apart .okay. [CLS] [SEP]and there 's the meat inside the coconut .
now in this clip we 're going to take you to a oberek in a promenade dance position .it 's going to start off with a two basic oberek steps 1. [CLS] [SEP]2. [CLS] [SEP]3. [CLS] [SEP]2 2 3.in this step gentlemen we 're going to hold that right hand and let her out. [CLS] [SEP], you lead the partner out next from you with the left hand and continue with holding that hand 3 2. [CLS] [SEP]1. [CLS] [SEP]2 2. [CLS] [SEP]3. [CLS] [SEP]4. [CLS] [SEP]2 3. [CLS] [SEP]1. [CLS] [SEP]2. [CLS] [SEP]3. [CLS] [SEP]2. [CLS] [SEP]2 3. [CLS] [SEP]3. [CLS] [SEP]2 3 4 2 3.now you can bring the lady back in 1 2 3 2 2 3 1 2 3 2 3 2 3 4 2 3 , just a little trick to teach you that keep two basic oberek steps to send her out and to bring her back .this is so you do n't get on different feet and that you can keep the same pattern when doing the oberek when with a new partner , 1. [CLS] [SEP]2. [CLS] [SEP]3. [CLS] [SEP]2. [CLS] [SEP]2 3. [CLS] [SEP]3. [CLS] [SEP]2 3. [CLS] [SEP]4. [CLS] [SEP]2 3. [CLS] [SEP]1. [CLS] [SEP]2. [CLS] [SEP]3. [CLS] [SEP]2. [CLS] [SEP]2 3. [CLS] [SEP]3. [CLS] [SEP]2 3 4 2 3 .
so the plants are excellent , excellent thing to implement if we need more vitality because this is your real life force .so this is the chi .plants cleanse air , so they produce a very good vital feeling in the room .so recently nasa did two years research on plants because in the space there , they have a lot of equipment of course .and they discover that there are some common house plants actually cleanse the air from all kinds of pollution including electro-magnetic pollution .and one of the plants that cleanses air is this golden pothos .this is an excellent plant to have in the house .so there are some other plants in the list as well .so but also , it needs a little bit of color .so we need a little bit of red , so some green , some water in the environment as we showed you before in those walden pond , beautiful pictures .so that all helps to bring , to boost that vitality .
this is called a dolly .when the clothes are finished and bagged and the initial ticket that i had the number of item and the day it was to be picked up is attached to the bag .it is then put on the dolly according to alphabetical of the first name .we like to have the last name first on all the garments and. [CLS] [SEP]so by the first name i am indicating the name , their last name really. [CLS] [SEP]because it ?s the first name you see on the ticket .however , things happen and sometimes we have a jessie and a j and its not his last name , but that is part of the business .this thing can move around then when a customer comes in to pick it up. [CLS] [SEP]and i just go to the name and pick up the garment .
your expectations are critical to his or her development .everything they do , as i said in the beginning , do n't expect a whole lot .scribbles are a whole lot and they 're a wonderful thing and that gives them the initiative and motivation to learn so. [CLS] [SEP]even scribbling should be said , that 's a wonderful job that you did .display their work .it 's one of the most important things we can do to build self esteem and self confidence .this is , let 's say scribbles by a child. [CLS] [SEP]and you may see it as nothing or scribbles. [CLS] [SEP]but you have the opportunity now to talk to your child and say , could you tell me a little bit about it ?see what your child is thinking and hearing and what would you like to call it ?what i like to do with scribbles and. [CLS] [SEP]what i tell parents to do is get another sheet of paper out and let the child witness you writing .for example , what would you like to call it ?and what he called it was a fun day at the lake .it does n't look like a fun day at the lake to you or i but to the child it does so then you would simply write over here a fun , and you say it as you write it , day , and you continue , at the lake , along with his picture .and here , tell me about the picture .and he may tell you a little bit more. [CLS] [SEP]but you 've written a fun day at the lake. [CLS] [SEP]and he had a good time , does it stop there ?no .you say , you know , i like that so much. [CLS] [SEP]and we had such a wonderful day , let 's go ahead and put it on the refrigerator for a few days and look at it .that helps .all of a sudden his work is being displayed .you 've also helped with creative and critical thinking and they want to enhance their work .and then on friday you may do the same thing .you have several pictures and you say let 's choose a picture to display. [CLS] [SEP]and then when you pull down a picture , put it in a save folder. [CLS] [SEP], do n't ever let your child see you say okay ,well we 're done with that picture and throw it in the garbage can .never ever do that .have a save folder .later down the road is when you both will choose which pictures to finally say it 's time to put them somewhere else .so that 's the importance of displays by children .
what i 'm going to do next is i 'm going to show you how to lay a hi hat over what we already recorded .i 'm going to go into my same track. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to hit the same duplicate , with the same settings .and i 'm just going to play a little hi hat pattern over what i 've already recorded .so it 's a little bit off .what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to go to my quantize , and quantize the sixteen a. [CLS] [SEP]and listen to it one more time .what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to go to my first original snare track , and. [CLS] [SEP]what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to get rid of this little extra snare in there by highlighting it and deleting it .then i 'm going to go into my next track and see what we 've got there as well .looks like this one 's all right .i might actually take this last one out .actually , ill leave that one in there .so let 's listen to it one more time .
well for me personally i started teaching aerobics classes and when i was teaching my aerobic classes. [CLS] [SEP]i had people come up to me asking if i could train them .and then i looked into it , i had a background already in kinesiology and went got certified. [CLS] [SEP]and i shadowed personal trainers and got a lot of information from them .i also personally have worked out since i was little. [CLS] [SEP]so i also new a lot about exercise .and when i started training my clients and i saw my client 's lives changing for the better .it motivated me and got me excited to come to work every single day .there 's nothing else i 'd rather be doing .for example i had one client that would come in. [CLS] [SEP]and she was on some antidepressants and after two months she was able to get off of them. [CLS] [SEP]and she was a different person .and just so thankful. [CLS] [SEP]and i just love to see how somebody can feel better about themselves .i 've had people lose up to a hundred pounds and just to see the change and to see not only the change in their bodies but the change physically and mentally is amazing .and i think that 's what drives me to be a personal trainer .it really is a rewarding experience and it 's really what makes me excited to go to work for the day .i still really enjoy teaching my aerobics classes. [CLS] [SEP]but i definitely really like personal training. [CLS] [SEP]the best .i also would like to be able to go to people 's homes and do some training .some people do n't feel comfortable coming into the gym .some people like to exercise outside .and i want to be able to help them change their lives where they feel comfortable .
alright the drink we 're about to make is called a rum rickey .go ahead and put some ice in a glass here .and we 'll measure out one and a half ounces of light rum and follow that up with half an ounce of lime juice , one teaspoon of sugar syrup , and let 's just shake that up a little bit .alright , make sure you have a good seal on your shaker and your glass there .you do n't want to get it all over like i just did .alright , go ahead and pour that in to the glass. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to top it off with club soda .there we go .give it a straw. [CLS] [SEP]and we 'll garnish that with a cherry , just to give it some color .that is a rum rickey , nice refreshing drink for a nice sunny day .bottoms up. [CLS] [SEP]
another option for creating collage pieces , is to not just freehand draw a shape , but to actually establish a repeated pattern shape .so i 've made these patterns out of a little bit thicker stock paper ; this one maybe not so thick .but i like the pattern that i created here , and that way i can make repeated multiples of this same pattern , if that 's the way i 'm choosing to work inside of my collage .so it basically works the same way patterns , for pattern dress making or anything else is concern , and you just sort of lay it out , and trace around the edge that you want to use it for .now also keeping in mind , like what area of the piece you 're using , see how that 's going over that white edge , i may not want that edge actually to happen , but. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm just kind of showing you an example of how you can trace it out under the surface .and i would more likely tend to use the exacto blade for this area , because there 's a lot of curves and turns that are just a little more accepting when using the exacto blade knife , to achieve , rather than the scissors or the larger box cutter knife .
in this clip i 'm going to talk about how to speak with a french accent .well you can get a book and a cd. [CLS] [SEP]if you go to the dramabookshop.com about how to speak with a french accent , you can go to an acting coach , there 's lots of ways you can do it .but you should really learn how to speak french , that will help , well you do n't have to learn , but that 's one way that will help , you can just get an acting accent book , you can fake it too , totally .but in general speaking with a french accent , a lot of the sounds are in the front of the mouth , the `` r '' , it 's in the back. [CLS] [SEP], it 's not an `` r ''that 's there. [CLS] [SEP], it 's there ,so `` hey buddy , who bob '' ; `` i love to eat raspberries '' .now the accent , the strong syllable is always at the last , so if you say , elephant , in english we would say , elephant , the accent is on the first syllable , but the accent is always , for every word in french , on the last , so , `` i am going to the store '' .and also we can not say `` th '' sound , so they ca n't say `` th ''it 's too difficult .so that is speaking with a french accent , this has been athena reich in new york city .
so now we 're going to start tracing it .it 's got some lines in it , roof line and windows .you do n't want to spend a whole lot of time tracing .you want to spend your time painting .but you do need to get in a definite areas that are going to be hard-edged .areas that are soft-edged are not so critical .this is mainly just a guide .you 're not going to draw in everything .roof line here , church back here .the street and the shadows of the street , more windows and more windows .got lots of windows on this building , so we work it all in , a little pole , street lights , etcetera .
for this demonstration , i am going to use a pen to signify my bit that i am going to be cutting with .if i get ready to make my cut. [CLS] [SEP]and i just stick it in one of these corners , it is going to jump around a little bit until i get control of it .now that is not going to look very good. [CLS] [SEP]and that is going to make my hole a little bit bigger .if my hole gets too big , then my box wo n't fit properly in it .
there 's nothing to do ?oh yes there is .okay , what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to gently grab her leg .i 'm going to roll my side over here .you always want to roll towards the leg that is being locked .not this way .this is helping her .not a good idea .now what i want to do , i want to roll this way .okay , so i 'm going to go ahead and roll .and while i 'm rolling , try to spread the legs open .now that her legs are open , hopefully during the rolling she will get disoriented , and i could go ahead and manipulate her legs to spread them open .and when spread open. [CLS] [SEP]i can go ahead and try to mount her afterwards .again .okay ?now , if she were to hold on , and there 's enough space , keep rolling , rolling , rolling until you could either spread her legs open or just break out of it .sometimes with the rolling the arms get loose and your foot actually slips out .you either want the foot , while you 're rolling , you want the foot to either , go ahead , while you 're rolling you want the foot to either slip out this way and when it does just go ahead and pop it out or if you actually go in deeper. [CLS] [SEP]then that 's fine .you go back to neutral position right here .okay ?now i 'm going to show you a different kind of a leg lock .
well a septum is the divider between the right and the left chambers of the nose inside .it 's made from cartilage and bone .it is frequently traumatized which causes it to grow crookedly or it may even fracture from a car wreck or maybe from a fall on the playground when you were a child or even from trauma coming down the birth canal being born .all of these things can cause the septum to grow crookedly .it can have an effect on the breathing in one chamber of the nose .when it does cause nasal obstruction. [CLS] [SEP]it is an indication to have it fixed because it will help with your breathing .when septums are very deviated sometimes the external part of the nose will follow the septum and deviate to one side or the other .in cases like that a patient will need a combined surgery of a rhinoplasty to fix the external part and a septoplasty to fix the internal part to get it perfectly straight .
make sure you give this a little stir right here .look at that .yes , it 's going .it 's going .set this right here .now technically , we use basically white rice for everything because with the mixture of these two combinations , it 's not going to be white for longer .if we wanted to make white rice , that 's whole other cooking story right there. [CLS] [SEP]so we ca n't really get into that right now .but we 're going to take this. [CLS] [SEP]and in it goes .you guys ready for this ?you guys ready out there , everybody in expert village ?and the unity begins .down it goes .push it in there with your hand a little bit .right on .now basically , it does look like a mountain right now .that 's okay .you take this. [CLS] [SEP]and you do n't want to stir it too much .you just kind of want to push it down .you kind of want to push it down and spread it around .now , it 's time for the water .now , you guys are all probably curious as to how much water we 're going to use .well there is n't really a set amount .what it is , is you just want to cover the rice .you just want to put a little layer of it .you want all your rice as i say , drown .and it is now drowning , as you see .at this point , you can stir it just a little .there you go .mix everything up a little bit .everything is mixed up .there 's a saying out there .you can have your rice paradito or mogollado .we prefer paradito .the trick to get is paradito. [CLS] [SEP]is cover it and leave it alone .no more stirring .got it ?do n't stir the rice because then it 's going to come out mushy .we do n't want it mushy .now , we 're talking mexican food .this is puerto rican food .paralito .
this drink is called dr. [CLS] [SEP]pepper # 1.go ahead and get a beer. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to fill half of our pint glass up with a lager like so. [CLS] [SEP], then you are going to fill the rest up , not to the top though with a cola , any type of cola will do , so half lager and half cola. [CLS] [SEP]and then you are going to fill a shot glass up with chilled amaretto .so half beer , half cola , chilled , amaretto .this is what it looks like so far .you are going to drop the amaretto right into the beer , ready it is going to be a little messy like so. [CLS] [SEP]and then you are going to down it. [CLS] [SEP], is n't that lovely ?this is a fun drink to do with a bunch of people and it surprisingly tastes a lot like dr pepper , i 'm not kidding , you would never know it right ?but it does , tastes a lot like dr. [CLS] [SEP]pepper .fun group shot too next time you have a bunch of people out , there you go , cheers .
you may think it is done , and you are perfect and it is all been done , but there is always more to find , there is always more to discover .it is really your job in your craft as an actor to keep practicing all the time .you want to inculcate good habits , good work habits in yourself .that makes you a confident actor , it makes you someone who they want to hire .so , keep practicing all the time , keep making yourself get better and better .ask friends for help , analyze your performance .it is your duty to yourself and you might say to your art to keep on practicing all the time , so make yourself do it .
alright now , we 're going to be -- go over on how to hold your nunchucks. [CLS] [SEP], it 's very important that you hold it properly .you do n't want to hold it way down here on the stick ,okay .it 's going to loose control and look really ugly and sloppy ,okay .you do n't want to hold it too high , or else. [CLS] [SEP]the string is not going to go give you a good spin , and you 're going to end up hitting your hand and pinching it , okay .you want to hold it one thumb link from the top .so it 'll look like this , one thumb link from the top , alright , here .okay .and then , right here , you can see it has pins it .i like to hold it right below the pins .okay .now , sometimes as you do your nunchucks , you 're going to be moving your hands up and down the nunchuck just like that , okay , as you start getting the spin in there , okay .so , you got to make sure you 're hold it correctly , one thumbing from the top ,okay .if you every switch and hold it like upside down. [CLS] [SEP], that 's fine too , okay .you do n't want to hold it -- again , you do n't want to hold it too low like this , or too high ,okay .too low or too high , there we go just like that .so we can flip it back around , it will look like that .you want to get one thumbing from the top again , okay .now , if you 're doing finger spins like flipping it over , you 're going to do things like that , flip it all the way back over , and all the way back around , okay .but always try to catch it , one thumbing from the top , okay .sometimes , you will be higher for certain moves .for pinching it , we can start again into more of those advanced spins , okay .but remember , right here , that 's where you always want to be .
going to talk about grip pressure for someone who uses more of a body swing with less hands .in general , if you have more of a body swing , upper body , entire body , if you 've been working on a swing where you 're more connected , which means your arms are against your body and your body is leading , the big muscles are leading the smaller muscles , in general , for that kind of a swing , swing theory , swing thought , a tighter grip .now that could be the four to six , it could be seven to eight in terms of grip pressure but the reason you want it a little tighter with a body , upper body connected type of a swing is that you want to make sure that when you turn your body , that the club , if you held it very light , would lag behind , getting stuck .we 've heard that expression a lot lately .so if you hold it very light with a body swing , there 's more of an opportunity for your hands to lag behind or even open up .but if you held it tighter , perhaps a six to eight grip pressure , when you turn into the ball , it 's going to move with you .as you can imagine , let 's say you had a cast on each hand and each wrist , as you turn your body into the ball , if you had a cast , you could see how it moves with you .but if you 're holding it really light with that upper body connected swing , hold it real light and turn , the club could lag behind .so in general , if you are a connected upper body , not very much hands in the swing , the grip pressure should be stronger .
now i 'm going to teach you a frontside 180. [CLS] [SEP]what a 180 is the difference between backside and frontside is backside you 'll be going to your right and front side you 'll be swinging your left arm over .so for this trick your going to want to do the basic alli with the popping with the pushing up and popping of the back , but your going to want to turn your shoulders and your legs. [CLS] [SEP]so you can go all the way around .every time you got to move your shoulder and your legs .
basically after you go through that other stuff you just slide in like this make sure it lines up. [CLS] [SEP]make sure the screw holes line up before you actually put it in .just going to slide it in right here and slide in like that .now what you want to do make sure it 's all right before you want to start screwing it in. [CLS] [SEP]so you do n't want to waste a lot time with turning it around .after you do that go ahead and take the screws and start screwing it in .your going to want to add a some pressure to make it a little bit easier to screw in .
that 's basically the main thing .the designer has a lot to do with it because when the designer builds his name , the more expensive the handbags get .way more expensive .that 's why you see a lot of bags out there that are fake compared to real ones because a lot of people ca n't afford the real ones .the real ones can cost up to like $ 30 ,000 .another reason why they 're really expensive is because some designers like to put diamonds on them. [CLS] [SEP]and as we all know , diamonds are not cheap so when you put those on handbags you 're talking about $ 50 ,000 .another reason why so many bags are so expensive out there is because the stitching .a lot of the more expensive bags are more durable , a lot more durable because the stitching is so close together and people have taken their time .they also may be hand made but most of all if you want an expensive bag , it 's going to last you a long time. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's what really matters .up next we 're going to talk about what do you want your bag to hold .
okay , now i 've strung one half of the necklace with all the different disk beads and we want to go ahead , because this is a simple type of bead , we 're going to do a centerpiece .so right now , i 'm at the half point of , and ready to go ahead and design my centerpiece .what i 'm going to do is probably put a couple silver beads on each side of it so that it can dangle nice and it wo n't be stuck in between the beads. [CLS] [SEP]and it will hang just right in the center of your necklace .this next clip is , we 're going to go ahead and string the centerpiece on .i 'm going to string a silver bead first , and that will go there .i will get a headpin with another silver bead on the bottom half of it. [CLS] [SEP]and then the large bead and then another silver bead on top , so it looks like so .what i like to do is get your cutter and leave about a quarter inch off the end here , trim it , and then get your needle nose pliers that have the little round tip nose , get the end here. [CLS] [SEP]and i curl it and put the end. [CLS] [SEP]that 's here , into the silver bead .not completely all the way in , but tight in there so that it makes like a little loop .you can see how i did that .then i grab a hold of it here , kind of line it up , and put it in there , then it will be ready for your necklace .you want to make sure that it 's kind of tight so that you do n't have to worry about the string threading through .you can see that , where it 's kind of in the silver bead .so then we go ahead and string it to the center of your necklace .that 's the beginning of the second half of your necklace now .
so i am going to go ahead and pull him out .as you can see , we are starting to turn white down the middle and such .i told you we were going to re drizzle. [CLS] [SEP]this guy in some clarified butter which is what we are going to do and to get to this point on the broil setting in the oven on the middle rack .it took about 5 minutes. [CLS] [SEP]i would. [CLS] [SEP]so we are going to do them just another 4 or 5 max. [CLS] [SEP]and it will be a done deal .you want to make sure and just use caution so that you do n't dry this out .this is a real nice seafood but seafood as a whole , the cooking time itself is never that long .it is just a softer protein .it does n't take that much time to cook .so we are going to go ahead and sew him back in there again for probably another 4 minutes , 5 max. [CLS] [SEP]and we will come back and show you what the finished product looks like .
some of the wood you can find or even buy is very , very spectacular .we 're going to take a look at some of these woods here that we 've got , and they 're kind of from all around the world .first one i want to show you here , is a piece of wood from here .it was , actually , it was in the river bottom close to my house .and this a piece of box elder .it 's a soft maple , but it 's a box elder burl .and how you can tell the burl is , all the little spikes that are on the outside of the tree .and this usually has bark on it .but that 's what makes all the pretty , wonderful eyes in here .even this little piece of found wood , we can turn into a little bit ...a bowl , and have a nice , little project out of it .here 's a piece of myrtle burl .now this comes from oregon , and it 's a bigger piece , and you can ...it 's hard to see , but you can see all the figure that 's in this .and very , very , very nice woods .there 's burls from all around the world .one of the most expensive is amboina burl .comes ...and amboina is one of my favorites .it comes from the far east , and it 's just a gorgeous burl .and it costs probably almost twenty to thirty dollars a pound .very expensive .this is a fun piece , this is called mazer birch , comes from finland .you can see the little lines , you can see a little bit of wax on the end .all the figure in it .some of the exotics that you can turn , tulip wood , very fun .king wood .now most of these exotics , you have to go to a specialty place that sells exotics , but , the exotics are a lot of fun .and it does n't take much to make a ...you know , this one you can get two pins out of easily .even though it 's quite expensive , you can get two projects out of it .if you want to do a plate , here again , here 's a ...this is babinga , and it 's actually ...you can see the figure in this .it 's just going to be a gorgeous platter when we get it done .one of my favorites is birds-eye maple .has all the little tiny eyes .just a gorgeous wood from here in the states .now as you can see , we 're going to have a lot of fun with this lathe , and you can turn anything , even found wood .you know , in the firewood pile , i found some great pieces of wood .just take it in on your band saw , cut it up and see what you 've got .
now we 're are going to discuss the hand tool .the hand tool can be found in our tool box here and course it 's hard to miss because it has a little hand right here .if we click on it you can see that this is just a move tool for just grabbing your screen and just moving it around .but i find this really an inefficient way to work .let 's max out my screen here , well actually lets zoom in here because you ca n't use your hand tool when its maxed out .lets say i have my brush tool selected .i 'm going to hit b for my brush tool .well if i hit the space bar the hand automatically comes up. [CLS] [SEP]so i do n't actually have to switch tools to actually use my hand tool if i 'm moving around my photo doing color corrections with my brush or just painting and doing things , because red looks really good with this photo , but its like. [CLS] [SEP]when i hit my space bar its like my hand tool comes up. [CLS] [SEP]so this is a better way to manage your word flow when your using this tool .also the hand tool has a shortcut key at the h to have your hand tool come up automatically .we 'll go back to the brush tool and hit h , there it is , hit b , e again for my brush tool .i 'm going to hit space bar because more efficient way to use my time .so , there 's your hand tool .remember your space bar shortcut key and it will help you get things done a lot faster .enjoy .
so i 'm going to go ahead and start on this other side and what we 're going to use is a pigment .pigment is loose eyeshadow and it 's pure color. [CLS] [SEP]so it 's really intense. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's really strong .the key to using a pigment is to make sure that you have a cream or something liquid underneath to get this pigment to adhere to .so we 're going to start out with a cream color base. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to put that on her lid. [CLS] [SEP]and then i 'm going to go ahead and apply this pigment right on top .alright , i 'm going to go ahead and apply this to her lid. [CLS] [SEP]and i kind of , i brush it on. [CLS] [SEP]but i also kind of pack it on because that 'll give me the most makeup for her lid .so i 've done that .and next i 'm going to use a thick kind of brush , a thick firm synthetic brush with the pigment .and i like to put the pigment in the lid so that i do n't make a mess .and the best way to use the pigment is to pack it in to your brush as hard as you can and then flick off all the extra and get all that extra dust off so that it does n't fall down on to the face .i 'm going to go ahead and apply that right on top .and you can see. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm not brushing it on because when you brush , little pieces of pigment and shadow will just will just kind of flicker off. [CLS] [SEP]and then it 'll land on the face. [CLS] [SEP]and it does. [CLS] [SEP]and it makes the face not look as clean .so i pack it on instead of brush .you can see how intense this color is .and it 's normal when you 're doing an intense eye for some of that color to fall or to get some underneath. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's. [CLS] [SEP]o.k .you can always clean it up with a sponge or with a foundation brush after .and i 'm going to use this color right here .it 's a copper color .it 's actually called coppering .and i 'm going to do a couple of different things with this look .i 'm going to do one color from the outside to the middle and one color from the inside to the middle .and then i 'm going to blend them all together. [CLS] [SEP]and that 's how you get all those different colors together. [CLS] [SEP]that , so it looks more like a rainbow of color rather than spots of color .so i 'm going to go ahead and blend that right in , right there .and then i 'm going to take. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to just wipe this brush off. [CLS] [SEP]so i do n't have to keep using more brushes .and i 'm going to take this color right here. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's just a light purple .and i 'm going to do that from the inside of the eye up to the middle and meet to the other copper color .and i 'm going to take that right in to the inside bridge of the nose .and i 'm going to blend it out into the copper .just like that .we 're going to need the clean brush that does n't have anything on it , and blend .you do n't want to see where the color stops .open .you can see there 's just a nice kind of a funky color .and you can do that with any color .you can take the color underneath of. [CLS] [SEP]you want , or you can leave it just like that , and then you 've got a funky eye .
how much fabric do i need ?because i do n't want to buy too much when i go to the store .well , if i 'm going to make one without sleeves , i simply double the dimension of my upper thigh .i happen to know the dimension of my upper thigh is twenty-four inches , so that means i need forty-eight inches of material .that 's one yard and one foot .now if i 'm going to add sleeves to that , i need the dimension of my upper bicep , which is on my arm is fifteen inches , and i 'm going to add a little more to make some room in the armpit , so make it eighteen inches .so forty-eight plus eighteen , so. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm looking at about sixty-six. [CLS] [SEP], you knew that already , did n't you ?sixty-six inches to make a unitard ,but if i 'm going to cut it on the bias , now i 'm going to tilt the entire pattern sideways. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to need about one-third more , about ninety-six inches .so if you want to save time and money , do n't cut it on the bias .
learning how to sing , if you do n't have a natural ability and you want to learn how to sing you can .you can get vocal lessons if you want to learn on your own .i would just try to emulate the singers that you really like and try to sing like them .and try to definitely if you can stay on key. [CLS] [SEP]that 's the most important thing .if you can stay on key then i would just exercise by singing along to your favorite vocalists and then expand off of that .work on your tone , work on the way you pronounce .but learning how to sing is a lot of it is natural ability .and staying on key would n't knowing if you 're higher. [CLS] [SEP]then the note or lower then the note is very important .if you can sing along and you hear yourself and you know that you are lower then the note. [CLS] [SEP]and you can sing up to the right note .then that 's good .another thing you can do is record yourself , you do n't even need to have recording studio , you could have like a little voice recorder and you can sing along and you can listen to yourself .so that way you get a better outside perspective of your singing ability .so basically you listen to your favorite singers , you record yourself. [CLS] [SEP], you listen to yourself , from a different perspective .those are pretty much basic things that you can help yourself learn how to sing .
i have this thing sewn down now .in the previous clip i 've shown you how to sew this closed and if you remember the original hem underneath was a blind stitch. [CLS] [SEP]but i chose to do a top stitch. [CLS] [SEP]and it looks just fine .looks great ! .and this is actually very normal .like half the pants that you get like this already have a top stitch .the other half will have a blind stitch .it does n't matter which one .but , i 'm going to go ahead and just take these pins out and what we 're going to do next. [CLS] [SEP]is tack this one and a fourth inch cuff up .and we can see the marks at one and a fourth inch .and what i 'm going to do is just get right over here. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm actually going to put my thumb in there and push it in .have it , hold it all together and turn it up .and i 'm just going to pin it right here .and then i 'm going to go to the other side. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to do the same thing .i want to pull it straight , put my fingernail right there on that mark on the bottom and fold it over right there at the top where you can see that .here we go .now that hem is in , cuff is in place , here we go .and i want to actually do this to the center , too .just to make sure everything 's lining up nice and straight .let me hold that tight and there 's the mark .i 'm just turning it up right there .and just take your time .if it gives you problems and it 's kind of trying to move around , you just hold it until you get it the way you want it .same thing here .put my finger there .i want to pin this .i want to run over here and do the same thing to the other leg. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'll be ready to tack it down .and let me take these pins out .it 's a really good idea to have plenty of pins when you are doing this project because we do n't want the fabric moving around on you .the more you do this the more , the fewer pins you 'll need most likely .so , anyways , like i showed you .just pull it straight , fingernail on that mark and turn it over .and before we actually sew it and tack it up. [CLS] [SEP]i want to measure it all the way around to make sure it 's one and a fourth .because when you have a cuff like this it 's real easy to see if they 're mismeasured .if one is one and a half and the other one is one and a quarter ?you 'll be able to see that .and pull it straight , put my finger here and turn it under .you 're going to do this over and over .all the way around the cuff so it 'll be easier as you do it .same thing here is pull it , put your fingernail right there , turn it up and let me do a quick measurement all the way around before i use the sewing machine to tack it to make sure it 's one and a fourth .it 's one and a fourth .i 'm just going to measure right at the seams .and that 's one and a fourth .the other leg , one and a fourth .and this one , that 's one and a fourth also .so , in the next clip i want to show you how to actually use the sewing machine just to run a little seam all the way on each little corner to keep that hem , excuse me. [CLS] [SEP], that cuff turned up like that .so , we 'll do that in the next clip .
the marzipan could be used cause decorating the dinner table like the vegetables and fruits here it could be as a fancy chocolate dessert or a gift to a dear friend packed a small little case .it could be used on top of a cookie if you just want to surprise you kids or have a fancy birthday party and of course it could be for a cake decoration .
so we 're pretty much finished with the haircut and. [CLS] [SEP]at this point you have a lot people coming in that just stop in at there lunch break , businessman even if they are not definitely do n't want to send them out with having the little hair pieces hanging out in there hair .so at this point when you 're all finished go ahead take them back and either just give them a really quick rinse. [CLS] [SEP]or you can go ahead and shampoo them one more time .i 'll go ahead and shampoo my client so once you 've gone ahead and shampooed my client .stay tune for the next segment. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going to give you some tips on styling .
find out exactly all the information you need to make sure that choosing your tarantula will go smoothly and easily .first thing , where are you going to get your tarantula from .you can consider exotic pet stores , or surf the internet for online stores , but you need to make sure it 's a reputable source .once you 've found your source for a tarantula ask that source if your tarantula has been captive bred or wild caught .if it 's been wild caught ask if that wild caught tarantula has been collected responsibly .unfortunately tarantulas and their interest in the pet industry has grown remarkably , so it 's very important to make sure that you 're purchasing a responsibly collected or , excuse me , or captive bred individual , so that we are n't harming those species in their native habitats .now when purchasing your tarantula , you should see that tarantulas costs anywhere from thirty dollars to upwards of a hundred dollars or even more depending on the type of species .now a starter species will cost anywhere from thirty to forty dollars and these species will be chilean rose hair tarantulas or mexican red knee tarantulas .these are a good starter species and they are affordable as well .as you become more interested in the tarantula pet trade , you will find that your interest will grow and so will the price .so the old world species , the more interesting and exotic species tend to be a bit more expensive .make sure that the place that you purchase your tarantula from either has a good captive bred program or has the mark of collecting responsibly from the wild .with these tips you will definitely be able to get yourself a great tarantula from a great source .
and there 's the hard brush , which almost everyone has one of these .this is something that in the winter time , when your horses are very hairy , you can use this all over their body .in the summer time , i reserve this for either horses of mine that i know like a lot of pressure. [CLS] [SEP]and that are n't terribly sensitive to it or for areas on their legs where they 're getting muddy and dirty , and you need to get those cleaned up .it 's , the bristles are quite hard on this , and you want to be careful on a sensitive horse or a thin skinned horse , that you not apply so much pressure that you 're causing irritation to the skin .ok.but these do a nice job of increasing the circulation , increasing the blood flow , helping to warm up their muscles , as well as doing a good job of getting the dirt and mud and scurf off of them .you want to be careful using these to , a , be careful using them on the abdomen. [CLS] [SEP]and i do n't recommend using these on the face .
i 'm going to play the song with the right hand but just concentrate on the left hand pattern until you actually know how it goes .this is the verse .that 's how it goes .that 's the pattern , it repeats itself , very simple .now i 'm going to play through the entire verse , it repeats itself twice just so you can get the basic idea of how it goes .back to c.so basically , like the right hand , it goes back to c in the original position where you started the song and from there you can go into the next part of the song , again , starting with the chord of c .
so the next tool that you 're going to need is going to be your cutting tools .these you can pretty much decide on what works best for you , what 's your most comfortable with .i preferably always have on hand , three different types of cutting tools , or you 're never going to be sure exactly what you 're going to need , so just have them on hand .a pair of , good pair of cutting scissors , paper scissors are really important because you want some nice , clean edges on some part. [CLS] [SEP]so you want to get a nice pair of scissors .the most important tool is an exacto knife .the reason is for this is because this is going to provide you with the most detailed cuts .so you want to make sure that you can pick one of these up , anywhere , the hardware store , an art supply store that carry this .but you also want to make sure that you have a ton of extra blades .the blades can dull out on this pretty quickly and when you 're coming to final points and edges. [CLS] [SEP]you do n't want it to tear or rip the paper in a way that you were n't looking for .so always have extra blades .and i also tend to have a box cutter knife and the reason for this is for larger cuts .you want to be able to have enough more efficient tool than the smaller blade that the exacto comes with .
i 'm beau timkin .i 'm master sake sommelier and in this segment on daiginjo , i 'd like to speak to how daiginjo 's actually crafted , hand crafted .because i 'll be honest , there is sake and there is daiginjo when it comes down to manufacturing .they literally treat daigingo differently .it 's almost quarantined because they 're going to such extremes in trying to create such a nuance , subtle product .now , that said , they will typically , brewers will typically brew daiginjo sort of at the end of the season or after they 've worked out the kinks of the beginning of the year , the equipment and be honest , they use equipment different than other equipment for the other categories of sake , for daiginjo .now , what do i mean by that ?typically when you press sake , they 'll use a big air bladdered machine , it looks like an accordion , has a wonderful sound , dadadadadadadada..and it presses sake together , all the fluid together , and all the in fermented rice particles stick in this machine and. [CLS] [SEP]the food comes running below .when you make hand crafted daiginjo sake , what the brewers will do is they will put the fermented rice gruel in these cotton bags .and they line these bags up in what looks to be like a sardine tin .they line them all up. [CLS] [SEP]and then they put a lid on that , and they crush that baby .what i mean by crush , they apply so much pressure that it pushes the fluid out of the unfermented rice particles and down in to a little slot. [CLS] [SEP]and it 's captured .this is a gentle form of not using a machine .it is more labor intensive and obviously it 's far more expensive .now that 's not the pinnacle .there is a style of sake called shisuku style where they fill bags up with the fermented rice particles and they hang them over vats .and these bags literally will drip .shisuku stands for trickle , trickle sake .so they do n't use any pressure .these are really high , high , high end manufacturing techniques for hand crafted daiginjo sake .so the shisuku and also the different ways of using the press , the funai , old traditional style versus the modern kind of accordion one .when you make daiginjo sake you 're also using a rice varietal that will allow you to mill to certain levels .some rice. [CLS] [SEP]you just can not mill down to forty percent removal , sixty percent remaining or fifty percent removal , fifty percent remaining .you need a very special brewing rice .one of the most popular brewing rice is a rice called yamada nishiki .and this is a brewing rice that 's very hard on the outside , which is good for the friction of milling , for polishing. [CLS] [SEP], it stands up to the milling and very soft on the inside .it absorbs water that helps it kind of explode when it gets steamed .so daiginjo manufacturing is ever so slightly different than regular sake kind of manufacturing in that it 's. [CLS] [SEP]so pampered and. [CLS] [SEP]so flavor intensive and so loved and that is the reason why you 're paying a premium for daiginjo sake .
so , with the rim click , you actually have quite a plethora of sounds at your fingertips .just moving the sticks slightly can evoke a starkly different sound .so , i want you to listen to the difference between the position that i had the stick in and the sound that it made the first time versus when i move the stick , just slightly move the bead slightly towards the center of the drum .you can hear that the pitch is a lot lower and as you play around , this is one of your most sensitive strokes .you can get that first sound , you get that deeper sound. [CLS] [SEP], you get deeper still. [CLS] [SEP]and you can get higher and you can get almost puny .this is one of the best areas to just play around with and every song , every chorus or verse that you play , you 're going to find that within your first two or three rim clicks you 're going to find that sweet spot where it sounds exactly like you want it to for that part of the music .
and you have this one over here .it also has corner cuts but it also has a nice little indian design on the bottom .and this one is almost like a shadow box .you have design , but yet you have a shadow box with real indian pottery .and then the one over here of the clown , she is in an oval. [CLS] [SEP]so you can do oval mats and also small little cuts .so , this is just a few of the ways that you can personalize your own piece of artwork and something that is unique and that is one of a kind .now your frames are also very important .like this one over here that does n't have a frame on it .putting a frame on it finishes your work .you would n't want to put like just a little simple metal frame on this because it would n't look very good with an ancient piece of pottery .so we 've used a nice , beautiful distressed molding .simple , but beautiful .this one here we used sort of a gold antique which goes very nicely with your pot. [CLS] [SEP]that 's in this one .and this one we just wanted a little bit of spice with the little points on here .so each one compliments the picture that it 's framing .
ladies and gentlemen , now let 's get on to the next section of the shaolin long fist .starting from previous section .right hand in ; one , left hand in ; two , step back ; three , chop ,okay you 're going to bring this hand up , go this hand , raise your knee , go down , punch out , turn , one , two , three , four , five to six one pull in , seven , eight , one , two , three , four .okay .ladies and gentlemen let 's do it again .starting from the previous clip , down , one , two , three , chop , hands , one , two , three , turn , one , two , three , four , five , six , pull in , seven , eight , one two ,elbow , punch .okay , let 's go again .from here , one , two , three , chop , one , two , three , down , turn , one , two , three , four , five , six pull in , seven , one , two , elbow , punch .ladies and gentlemen this concludes this section .
you would not want to take drivers ed , and on the very first day , the instructor said `` ok , lets go ; lets get on the highway '' .you ?d start driving without knowledge and. [CLS] [SEP]of course , this could be very dangerous .in the same respect , i believe that students should learn how to kick , punch , and block , first .they should know how to control those techniques , so that , when they do actually put on their safety gear , they will have an idea of what they are doing .i would avoid a martial arts school which makes you spend a lot of money on sparring equipment .having kids start sparring right away , even as a white belt , could be scary .this is because , there are going to be kids who are very aggressive and there are a lot of kids who are passive .this is a good way to scare off a lot of people .they will not gain the benefits of martial arts that they would otherwise .
there we 've got our stuffing in the bed .
one of my favorite subjects is the art of faking which is also known as an indirect attack .there is a variety of fakes .we know that faking wants to gain us time and gain us distance .this particular fake strategy is called position fake .watch this .joining us from pro star mixed martial arts is mr. [CLS] [SEP]joe brignoli .let 's come over here a little bit. [CLS] [SEP]so you are kind of looking over his shoulders. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're his eyes .right now we are both in alignment and distance to fire at each other .we are both at the set point control position so from here i can step in and fire on him. [CLS] [SEP]and he can step in and fire on me , we 're both set to fire .so i do n't like being here for long .i want to hit this position and then move , position .let 's talk about position fake , alright .watch from this side now .an example of the position fake would be for me to slide to the right possibly , slide to the left possibly and then watch this. [CLS] [SEP]i will do a draw step , my right foot will move to the right and my shoulders will go with them. [CLS] [SEP]but i keep my hips here .for you it looks like this .typically i go to the right here , i go to the left here , draw a fake , position fake. [CLS] [SEP], shoulders go , hips stay where they are kind of like in basketball when you are doing a fake .i will pull that foot back in and then step in and fire. [CLS] [SEP]so what is the effect to the position fake .when i step to the right and drop he is either going to mentally adjust , hesitate , think for a second , or physically start to adjust and reposition over here. [CLS] [SEP]so i want to catch him in mid-reposition , mid-reposition .so when i hit there he is just going to cut the ring off and stay with me. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm just going to fake to the right , come back and attack. [CLS] [SEP]so i want to hit him with a jab elbow. [CLS] [SEP]but i 'm not doing it directly. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm using a little position fake to set it up to step in and fire in .another quick position fake i might step in and fire , come out , step in and fire , come out , step in and fire , fake out and come right back at him again .that 's a position fake .i 'm john graden .for more information contact me at johngraden.com .thank you .
this is the first step , to weigh the ingredients .the second step is to mix the ingredients , the third step is to let the dough rest and the fourth step is cutting the dough , which is what i 'm doing right now .we 're going to weigh this bread ; this is called our seven grain bread .the ingredients come from germany .what we 're going to do is , we 're going to cut it. [CLS] [SEP], we 're going to egg wash it. [CLS] [SEP]and we 're going to put some oats on top .it sat there forty-five minutes .it all depends on the temperature of your ambiance area .this particular dough sat for forty-five minutes , i punched it down and it 's ready to be cut .we weighed one pound and eleven ounces .we cut eleven ounces and the remaining. [CLS] [SEP]we just divide into the dough and then we roll the dough into round balls .
we are going to shift the weight again into the right leg and bring the left knee into the chest and over her , crossing over to the right leg .this is called gerudasana .now the arms , let 's take your arms wide , and then bring your left arm underneath your right .so you 're going to cross at the elbows , left under the right and then continue wrapping if that is comfortable for you .if it is not you can just simply hug the hands around the shoulders , show that way .that 's an option here , just so you feel the shoulder blades separating off the spine .it 's a nice stretch , especially since we have been doing all this forward lifting , heart lift and elevation to get some nice stretch in those back muscles .squeeze the inner thighs and then pay attention to the back foot .now to come out of this just simply bring the arms over head , inhale , take the left leg to the floor and then exhale to tadasana and then come right into the second side .inhale the arms overhead and exhale and in one swoop let 's take the right arm under the right leg over .concentrating on your center or solar plexus. [CLS] [SEP]and i want you to really feel your balance from your core right here innate .then lift up through the spine , beautiful , take the elbows up away from the chest , forearms away from the head and squeeze the inner thighs to create some juice in the legs and some foundation there .inhale coming back out and that is eagle pose .exhale hands to your heart .ready for our next balance .
now , to give the sticks extra support , i 'm going to show you how to tie them after we 've glued them together , and to make a knot so that they 'll stay nice and strong , even if there 's a strong wind .so we go ahead , and we take the string , and leave a little bit extra on the end ; hanging out , so that we 'll have some room to tie it , and just go back and forth in a crossover motion ; making sure that you catch both sticks .you can switch direction , you can go over from the left side , or over from the right side , and just keep weaving back and forth , until you see that there is very little movement on the sticks ; that they 're nice and strong and kept together .now , the sticks are going to be placed into the dibbles that will be glued on the plastic , so it 's not necessary to make it so that they do n't move at all .but usually , even with a good knot , you can get them pretty tight , and you probably wo n't see too much movement on the sticks .but just make sure that they 're nice and tight ; stuck together .then , after you 've gone through a few times , take the last bit of string , and the other end , and make a couple of knots on top of each other , and this should help you keep the sticks nice and strong and in place .as long as you 're using a good piece of plastic , you 'll see that the kite will be nice and sturdy .after we 've put the string around the sticks , and we 've cut the ends , what we do is we take a little bit of glue ;here i 'm. [CLS] [SEP]using a type of rubber cement glue , and we put it around the knot , and this will help it stay in place , so the strings should n't separate where we 've made the knots .now the sticks are flexible .they can still be pushed up and down a little bit , but they definitely wo n't come apart .they 're very sturdy ; stuck one to the other .now , once we cut our plastic in the shape of the kite , we 're ready to put our sticks inside , and make it nice and sturdy , and help the kite keep its shape .
this is a critical thing .you plan on how you 're going to say i love you .whether you are a man or a woman , you set up the scenario .i am going to tell this person today that i love him or her .we will go to a place that is quiet , we 're not going to a place that has this loud band rocking in the back and. [CLS] [SEP]you saying i love you , that does n't work .set the plan .and go for example on a picnic .and you 're looking at each other , it 's a very , very nice situation .and you 're under the trees and you have a blanket and a picnic basket , the whole business , and you look at the other and ...i love you .see how it 's done ?that 's how it works .and that 's the way the want to work it .work your plan then .you 've already planned your work .where else can you go ?there are any number - it does n't have to be a beach , it does n't have to be a picnic , it does n't have to be anywhere except a place where you can certainly look at the other , it can be a quiet restaurant , and there are too many loud ones .it can be a quiet place for eating .some place that has a difference to it , so that the two of you can communicate .and you simply look the other in the eye and let them know .do n't hem haw around. [CLS] [SEP], i think i love. [CLS] [SEP]you does n't get it .i love you , smooth. [CLS] [SEP], i love you , direct , i love you with encumbrance .that 's how it 's done .if you drop the ball there , guys , or if you fumble , ladies , guess what ?you will never be believed .it 's not a subtle thing , it 's not a halfway thing , it 's a direct communication with the other .this is doctor paul , may your fantasies of today be your realities of tomorrow .
hi , my name is tres hoyt .i 'm here at asel art supply in austin , texas .i 'm going to talk today about graffiti lettering .graffiti lettering is a pretty broad topic .there are probably , literally hundreds of different styles of graffiti hand style .you go around the world and it will change .you can go around the country and it will change .but i have here , three examples of three different basic alphabets .and these are really , really basic form alphabet letters .so i 'm going to go ahead and do this third one for you all .so you can see the strokes that i make .one of the easiest ways to hand style , is to just practice .you can find different fonts and copy them .or you can take your basic , basic alphabet .and just start tweaking the letters as you see fit to little positions that you like .i like to work on graph paper .so i try to keep most of my letters in a consistent size .and i do n't start drifting at angles when i write .but you can use either a brush type pen for flared effects .or just regular graphic pens or pretty much any kind of marker you want .but here we go. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm just going to go ahead and start with the bottom alphabet here .and show you all the stroke making .and just like that .the easiest way , like i said to learn a lot of these alphabets .is just practice , practice , practice many of these .get your flared style and all that .but , yeah , that 's essentially. [CLS] [SEP]that 's graffiti lettering right there .
another good variation to learn from the front side nose slide is not just popping out forward , but learning how to front side nose slide and roll out fakie .the difference is , when you 're coming out , you 're going to want to roll and land fakie , rolling away .so what you 're going to want to do is , ollie into a front side nose slide , remembering to keep your feet over the front side of the board , because you 're going to put most of your weight on the nose .doing your front side nose slide , and then coming away and rolling fakie .this is a really good trick as a setup trick to get turned around sometimes in a line or skating .it 's just another way that you can come off .after you learn how to front side nose slide fakie , there 's a lot of tricks that you can learn from this one. [CLS] [SEP], that 'll show you how to get off from other nose slides and tail slides .the tricks you 'll need to be able to do to do a front side nose slide to fakie , is of course , you 're going to have to be very comfortable front side nose sliding .the front side nose slide to fakie is actually easier for some people than it is to pop out forward , so it 's very common for people to learn the fakie version before popping out forward .so , just go with whatever is comfortable for you .but the front side nose slide fakie is a very fun trick .
hello , i 'm sabrina karges and i 've owned and operated tko , teleprompter computer operators , for over twenty years .and i 'm here to talk to you about how to be a teleprompter operator and business owner .what is a teleprompter ?it 's a display device that prompts the person speaking with an electronic visual text of a speech or a script .using a teleprompter is similar to using cue cards .the reflective glass is script or speech for the talent and that would be me .the glass is reflecting from the monitor .the monitor is being fed the script electronically from a computer where the operator is controlling the speed and feed of the script and speech .this application frees the speaker from having to look down at notes so they can look directly into the camera lens .cue cards would be placed away from the camera .the first teleprompter was created in the 1950 's and was a simple mechanical device that was paper fed .jess oppenheimer , producer of. [CLS] [SEP]i love lucy , claims credit for the original concept of the teleprompter and was awarded the patent .lucille ball used the teleprompter to read the commercials on her show .the word teleprompter was derived in the united states , which is also known as prompter .another term used primarily in the uk is auto cue .and i might add. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm using a teleprompter monitor , but it 's off camera .can you tell ?off camera , on camera .off camera , on camera .i think i need to get another system .
we 've been in the front seat and nibbled around the car a little bit .i have n't even got ya 'll to the meat of the fish. [CLS] [SEP], you see what i 'm saying , this is the real loaf of bread right here baby , this is the good natural spring water in the back seat because everybody 's got something loose in the back seat going on .in the back of my car , you 're subject to find laptops , shoes , clothes , pieces , all of kinds of documents , come on now another book .alright. [CLS] [SEP]so you can see where we 're going with this .we 're going to start with the loosely pieces of clothing .first we 're going to talk about the stalking cap .when it 's cold outside , you probably have a stalking cap in your back seat .there it is .can i get with ya , do you know what i 'm talking about ?wonderful spot. [CLS] [SEP], still there is n't no money come out of it because i hid it in a secure spot .do you know why , do you know why ?because i know how to hide money in your car .
hi my name is lauren. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm here to talk about how to straighten curly hair .when you are doing your straightening you want to make sure you use first off a hot tool. [CLS] [SEP]so one of the easiest ways to actually go through and straighten your hair especially when it is very coarse , thick and curly and especially since your hair is a little on the coarser side what is going to happen is it is going to be able to withstand some of the heat from the flat iron you are going to blow out your hair first and use a big paddle brush in order to kind of get it as straight as you possibly can .after you are done and your hair is dry. [CLS] [SEP]you are still going to have some curl and maybe a little bit of frizz left in it .you are going to do smaller sections .you want to do small sections so that way you can make sure that you get each hair shaft from root to end .you are going to use a thermal protectant in order to protect your hair from the heat .it is very important to protect your hair from the heat because you are basically reforming the hydrogen bonds of your hair in order to make it go straight .you then use a comb and comb through the hair and then follow with the flat iron .what that does is it helps get any knots out and it helps prevent any creases .so you are going to put the comb up by the root and then follow it with the flat iron all the way down .when you are done you are then going to kind of just smooth it .you are then going to move on to your next section working your way from the bottom up and it makes it a little bit easier .again you are going to spray it .you do n't want to take sections that are too big because otherwise you can get lines that are within your hair .you are going to use your comb to guide your straight iron out because it is going to pull out any of those knots and smooth the hair a little bit for you .once you have gone through your entire head and you have now straightened your hair. [CLS] [SEP]you are going to want to keep it .the best thing to do is t use some sort of silicone based product .silicone coats over your hair cuticle and prevents your hair from absorbing , your cuticle from opening to absorb any water or moisture from the hair .it will prevent frizz and it will also prevent your hair from going back to its original curl .curl needs water in order to strengthen the bond so when your hair is grabbing moisture say if it is a very humid day then your hair is going to automatically start to strengthen its curl bonds and it is going to go back to a wave or some curly .a silicone based product or some sort of palm aid will help coat over that cuticle and prevent moisture from ruining your perfectly straight hair that you set and that is how to straighten curly hair .
now you might be asking , how do you actually take care of and work on a child ?well i 'll tell you it 's very similar to working on an adult. [CLS] [SEP]but obviously we do n't use the same force that we would on an infant or a child as we would say a professional football player .a lot of times we actually use a pinkie contact with just a very slight pressure to actually aid us in moving these bones and getting the pressure taken off of the nervous system .some of the conditions that are actually helped with when we are talking about children and chiropractic are things like ear infections , which respond very nicely to chiropractic care .also colic , several studies have now shown how colic can be immensely improved while undergoing chiropractic care .and allergies and digestive troubles and all kinds of other things are also helped with chiropractic care .i want to tell you real quickly about a study that was done in nineteen eighty nine .they did a study comparing the households of chiropractic children versus the households of a pediatric family .and what they were looking for , they wanted to see which household potentially was more healthy compared to the other one .what they did was they polled two hundred pediatricians and they also polled two hundred doctors of chiropractic and. [CLS] [SEP]what they found was that chiropractic children had fewer ear infections then those of the pediatric group .in fact only twenty percent of the two hundred that were polled reported experiencing ear infections , where as sixty nine percent of those polled in the pediatric group reported having ear infections .now i do n't know about you. [CLS] [SEP]but it seems like the chiropractic household maybe was a little bit more healthy than that of their pediatrician counterparts .
sending stuff back home is also an option .on some of my tours you go from places where it is cold to places where it is hot .and so you start going to the post offices in town and sending home the cold weather gear you do n't need. [CLS] [SEP]and i have actually sent home some other stuff .one of the things i 've sent home is once i got through the rocky mountains where there is a lot less civilization i sent home my water filter .but while i was in the rocky mountains , when you are in utah and in the desert and there is very little civilization around a water filter is a really nice thing to have .i have filtered water from under railroad trestles , under freeways , you ca n't believe where i have gotten water and. [CLS] [SEP]you know if you have got a good water filter like this one. [CLS] [SEP]is you tend to be pretty much. [CLS] [SEP]o'kay if the filter technology is pretty good on these filters now .one thing to bring along now maybe if you do n't want to bring the whole filter is just iodine tablets .in a pinch it is a lot less weight and bulk in a filter and. [CLS] [SEP]in a pinch you can just choose iodine tablets to make sure your water is reasonably potable .but so this is something that goes along with the kitchen kit. [CLS] [SEP]and you just want to make sure you have that water filter if you think you need it .again most areas are inhabited enough .you know i certainly have a water filter in virginia , kentucky , missouri or kansas but places like utah , nevada , wyoming , montana , out here in the west a water filter can prove to be something that gets you that sweet nectar of life when you really really need it .
clancy rose : all right .so now we 're going to talk about the beans that you are going to use for your espresso , for your con panna .so one of the common misconceptions about espresso roast is that coffee is roasted darker for espresso , which is n't necessarily true .you could use any coffee that you want for your espresso shots .what makes an espresso an espresso is the process that you go through to make the espresso shot , and it 's the extraction process of the espresso and the ratio of coffee to water .in an espresso shot , the ratio of coffee to water is a lot higher than it would be in a normal cup of coffee .
suspension is the opposite of retention .in retention we 're holding our breath , in suspension what we are doing is exhaling the , all the air completely from the lungs and then suspending our breath , keeping the body completely empty .while retention is being full , suspension is being completely empty .and after breathing out , holding this for a count of three , five , ten whatever works for your own body .getting used to having all the air expelled from your lungs may take a little while .it 's quite difficult to have that feeling sometimes of being completely empty. [CLS] [SEP]but you should get used to it soon .
okay , the second type of eulogy that you can choose to write and present is shared memories , or personal reflections .shared memories or personal reflections or recollections .this is probably the easiest to write because you 're going to write the entire speech with no formal structure about your personal memories of this person .your experiences .and this is probably the one that you would choose if you had a close relationship with this person , especially over an extended period of time .you 're going to speak from your point of view about this person .you can talk about anything you want , but it 's your personal point of view .now , the trick is , it is the easiest to write , but it is the hardest to deliver , because there is an intense emotional connection because you 're talking about your personal experience with someone who is now deceased , who you probably miss a lot .but it 's a great choice .
in this example , what i 'm going to do is what they call speed picking or tremolo picking .and , basically , all that is is i 'm going to play on a single string .it 's going to go. [CLS] [SEP]and , you know , pick every note .so over the progression and backing track , it 's going to sound a little bit like this .okay , and what i did there was simply play it in the b-minor progression starting on b and speed picking .so the seventh fret , nine , ten , twelve , ten , nine. [CLS] [SEP]and then i did a quick hammer on pull off .so , even while you 're speed picking , still throw in other techniques like hammer ons and pull offs and so forth .and , again , throwing in that little flat , b-flat , it sounds really nice because it gives it that flamenco sound with the speed picking as well. [CLS] [SEP]and you create an interesting sounding melody line .
now , i just talked about some shots and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm going to give you an example of those shots right now .we talked about more of the strategy and what to do depending on where your opponent was , and now i 'm going to show you the style and the technique it takes to do these shots .the first i 'd like to start with is the lob shot , because not only is it good for when your opponent charges the net on you , but it 's also good if you 're running after a ball. [CLS] [SEP]and you 've reached the other end of the court .where if you hit a hard shot back , you 're going to give them the chance to hit the ball across court. [CLS] [SEP]and you 'll never get back to it .sometimes you need to do a lob shot to buy yourself time too , not only to hit it over the person 's head .a good lob shot usually hits on the other side of the court beyond the line , beyond the serve line here .a good lob shot you want to hit at least to here or back , which is sometimes hard to judge and why it takes a lot of practice .a good lob shot you want to have the tennis racket angle a little bit up in the air. [CLS] [SEP]and you want to hit the ball high enough to where that person ca n't reach it if they 're at the net with the racket jumping .so here 's one example of a good lob shot .notice how i made it almost to the back line. [CLS] [SEP]and it was well high enough to where nobody , even shaquille o'neil , was going to reach it .now , do n't practice a lob shot against the wall for obvious reasons .it is good to practice with a partner when you 're out here playing and getting warmed up .
i 'm a singer song writer pianist living in west palm beach , florida and also new york city .in this clip we 're going to be talking about how to prepare your body physically for singing .the first thing you need to do is just stretch everything out .if i were standing i would actually do my back rolls , i would do a tip and roll from the back all the way down touch the floor .that kind of stuff .but sitting at the piano the easiest thing you can do is start with your shoulders .i would roll them backwards eight times , forwards eight times .you want to lift them up and relax them , and lift them up and relax them .do that some .the point is you want everything from here to here especially to be relaxed and stretched out , and energized .and this is the best way to do that .i would do some breathing exercises .in and out .in and out .i would roll , do head rolls like this .be careful when you go back not to crunch on top of the spinal column but to be thinking about a string pulling the top of your head at an angle around the circle .and even do your jaw .make sure you 're loose here .you can warm up your voice too while you 're doing this .ahh , that kind of thing .sometimes i will even massage the mask here because when you sing you want to feel the vibrations through out all of this part of your face .now if you 're going to be playing the piano accompanying yourself while you sing obviously. [CLS] [SEP]you want to physically prepare your hands , the rest of your arms , message this out and get that all relaxed .you might even sort of like beat on the muscles of your forearms .that sort of makes you go like. [CLS] [SEP]oh neat. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm ready to do stuff .so that 's really ,i mean that 's really it .anything else that you can think of that you like , it 's just important that all of this is relaxed and energized at the same time .this is tom kenaston and this has been how to prepare physically for a performance .
hi my name is lauren with makeup by dodge and today we will be discussing how to make your cheekbones look higher .so when you look at your cheekbones you are going to see that there is a natural , there is the apple of your cheek and then there 's the plain of your cheek just right under your eye socket .this will be followed by a hollow which you will use a shadow to pull just right underneath your cheekbone .this is a little dark so you can lighten it up with a little of your medium color and then also before we apply the highlight on top of the cheekbone if you put a little shadow just right above the cheekbone. [CLS] [SEP]it will make it pop automatically .the idea between highlight and shadow is shadow is going to make the eye believe that that area is pulling away from the surface and the highlight will make the eye believe that it is coming towards the surface. [CLS] [SEP]so naturally it will just pop .so for the highlight take your lightest color and put it just on your cheekbone .you can do this with powders as well , with contouring powders or to make it look a little more natural you can use foundation like we just did today .
we want to make sure that when he sheds the block we want him to take the proper angle and try to meet this guy where he 's going and put a good stop on him .we 're going to show you what this looks like ( video demo ) .he 's going to shed the block , he 's going to take the proper angle. [CLS] [SEP]and he 's going to make a good tackle .you always want to make sure you meet that running back where he 's going .do n't ever come straight at him and give him an opportunity to outrun you to the side .in most cases , your defensive tackle will not be able to outrun a running back .so , take the proper angle to help yourself out and then make the big tackle .
so for our next step we are going to do is shampooing and conditioning the hair .shampooing and conditioning the hair is very very important cause the elements in the air , i mean we all know what is going on with the environment right now .it effects the hair .it really does so what you are going to want to do is get a very good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner and what we are going to do is shampoo .we are going to start at the scalp getting all the debris off the scalp and moving it through your ends .you are going to rinse that shampoo out , rinse it out very thoroughly .go back in with a moisturizing conditioner .i recommend using the conditioner mainly on the ends .do n't do it on the roots too much cause it is going to weight the hair down. [CLS] [SEP]but most of it is going to be on your ends ; you are going to put it through .you can also bring a comb and comb it through your ends .get rid of any tangles that you might have .rinse all the conditioner that you have in your hair .how about cholesterol should we put that cholesterol type of thing on your hair before we go blow dry it .a cholesterol is more of a deeper conditioner that is something that you would probably use under heat and then rinsing that out in the shower .so this is what we are talking about something like redken all soft which is great for your hair type .grace has a natural , has a naturally wavy curled hair all soft from redken .it actually has avocado oil in it. [CLS] [SEP]so it is going to act like what cholesterol would do .it is going to soften the hair which is going to make it much better to blow dry so that is what we are going to do into now .we would go ahead and go on to our next step .
let 's talk about how to choose a football .sound simple ?it 's really a little bit more difficult .for the young guys that are playing pee-wee or pop warner , that kind of thing , the size of the football is determined by the league .more specifically , the age and the weight of the kid .contact the league , and find out which size football you should be using .for high school kids , all the high school footballs are all exactly alike .for the college kids , all the college footballs are exactly alike .now , depending on your position , if you 're a center , right , you want to become familiar with the laces , because that is your whole world .same thing as a quarterback .the width of the football is specific to the age that you 're playing .again , little league , pop warner , has a specific width and length .high school has a specific width and length , college has a specific width and length .the only personal choice that i would say when it comes into choosing a football , in terms of name brand , is when you go to the store , you touch and feel five or six of them , in the specific category that your age dictates , and you find the one that feels good in your hands .if you play receiver , quarterback , running back , defensive back , you get a ball , and you keep it with you .you take it to bed , you sleep with it , you carry it to school , you do your homework with it in your sight .you have your football with you at all times .
in this clip , we 're going to be working on taking off the back tail end of the bike , so we can go ahead and get to that exhaust .we 're going to start first by taking our allen wrench bolts off .that 's going to be right here .go ahead and use your five millimeter allen wrench. [CLS] [SEP]and you 're going to take off all four bolts .there 's going to be one in each corner .this is going to be the first one right here .taking that one off and then go ahead and continue by taking all four off .for the last two , the ones back here , should all be the same size .then like i said before , make sure you put away all your bolts in a nice safe place .try to remember the order that you 've taken them off so when you reassemble your bike , you can make sure you put them back together in the right spot .some bolts are going to be longer than the others .the ones in the front were shorter .these ones are longer .we 're going to separate these to make sure we put them back in the correct spot in the rear section .go ahead and take off your last bolt .next , we 're going to be taking off these plastic clips right here .i 'm just going to use a regular phillips screwdriver and unscrew them .do n't go too hard because they are plastic and can strip them .you just want to go real gently .you 're just going to unscrew them like so and pop them right out .go ahead and unscrew these , they 'll become loose .i 've got my finger underneath it ,so i 'm going to be pushing it up as it comes out .then once you got , you can twist it with your hand a little bit .then it 'll pop right out .mine , it came apart but that 's fine , you can just go ahead and pull it right out then .there i go , just like that .that plastic part , it looks like that , it 'll pop right out .make sure you keep those together and do n't lose the pieces .then go ahead and do the other side when you 're done .
hi !i 'm going to talk a little bit about products that we are going to be using today .this is what works fro me .first we will start with the actual shaving cream ; shaving lotion some people may call it .this particular one is called foamy .it has aloe in it. [CLS] [SEP]and it is real gentle on the face because you know if shaving is not done right , shaving can be irritating .i choose a product like this that has some aloe that will make the process really comfortable .limit the amount of irritation in the process .also this is of course starting out , upon conclusion after the shave you want to use some moisturizer because you just went through a form of surgery you know .it is very minor .but it is a form of surgery .you are cutting and. [CLS] [SEP]so there is some irritation and it is good to have some type of moisturizer ; nothing too thick .
just go over to a mirror , take a look in it .whatever you happen to be wearing right there , i 'd say just put on some good skateboarding shoes and you 're good to go .if you want to help support your local skate shop and support the skateboard companies , we have a vast array of demographics that you can choose from in your favorite brands .and , that 's another way that you can dress like a skateboarder .but really , it 's ...it does n't matter nowadays .there 's not one set demographic .anybody can skateboard .it does n't make a difference what you 're actually wearing on your body .you know .you can just put on your comfortable clothes , and skate shoes are the only thing that i truly recommend you have , 'cause they 're flat soled and grip the board good .and other shoes do n't really work well .so , yeah , that 's how to dress like a skateboarder .
in this clip , we 're going to talk about the proper way to change your oil in your rear differential .in this clip , we 're going to talk about fluid capacities , types of differential fluid and the appropriate way to fill up your axle after your oil change .what i have here is the typical cheap stuff right off the shelf .this is sae 80w-90 weight .that is the viscosity weight of it right there .my vehicle calls for a 90 weight , just do to where i live at in michigan , i got the 80w-90 .depending on your specific axle , the gear oil will vary widely .most new body styles dodge trucks , takes a 75w-140 .what you 're going to make sure is that you refer to your owner ?s manual and see the exact fluid required for your vehicle and the fill capacity .i picked up one of these at the parts store today .this is a filling tube .as you can see , you do n't have a lot of room to work on up here. [CLS] [SEP]and you fill through the fill plug .this tube just screws down on the top in place of the cap .and it will make your life much , much easier when it comes to filling your axle .you 're going to want to fill your axle up with it sitting on the ground on a level surface .the reason why it has to be sitting on the ground on a level surface is the fill level for it .there is no dip stick for this .the fill level for it , is dead even with the bottom of the hole your fill plug screws into .what you do is you squeeze the fluid in the appropriate amount .it 's going to call for one maybe two of these jugs .once it begins coming out of where the fill plug screws in , that is the appropriate fill level .like i said , refer to. [CLS] [SEP]your vehicles owners manual for the fluid capacity of your rear axle .alright , i 'm underneath my rear axle. [CLS] [SEP]and i got the cap off my fill tube. [CLS] [SEP], i 'm going to take and insert that into the fill plug on my axle .there we go , i 'm going to squeeze it all the way in and open the valve on my filler tube .these fill tubes have an on off valve which makes them great for tight locations like on this explorer .what i 'm going to do once i have the fill tube into the fill hole. [CLS] [SEP]is open the valve .i 'm going to tip my jug up level with the ground. [CLS] [SEP]and i 'm going give it a squeeze .as you can see the oil passing through the tube , up into my rear axle .alright , you 're going to continue feeding oil into it until you see it just start to come out the bottom of the fill plug .there we go .i 'm going to tip my fill tube and jug down and out of the way .i 'm going to put the cap on it and make sure we do n't spill any .we stay environmentally friendly and close the valve .roll out from underneath here .alright , that is the proper way to fill your rear axle after the service .
alright , in this clip we 'll be moving on to the arms .which are also tricky .you want to make sure you know exactly what you 're doing and what your proportions are going to be before you go in and actually draw the arms because it can literally either make or break your picture .so , first what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to give myself a marker. [CLS] [SEP]so i know exactly how far to go .i 'm going to give myself this far for each elbow and here for each forearm .just to give you sort of a map to go by .and you do n't want to give too much detail to the arms yet .just quick little shwoops .and , try not to call too much attention to them , because if you do your character will end up looking kind of silly .arms are not easy to learn .i mean , honestly , it kind of takes a while before you sort of get comfortable with them .you 'd think they 'd be easy but their honestly not because they can literally ruin your entire drawing .so what we 're going to do here. [CLS] [SEP]is we 're going to give this girl. [CLS] [SEP]her hands are going to be on her hips .so that 'll kind of determine where the hips are .just kind of want to come in here with the hand .not going to give it too much detail .her hands are just going to be resting on her hips here .we 'll get the little fingers just a little bit of detail , just to kind of show where they are .not too much though .and then the way this will work is we 'll end up building our hips around the hands as they just sort of rest there on the hips .give her some jewelry .go in here and give her some sleeves .now , it kind of looks weird right now. [CLS] [SEP]but once we draw in the rest it 'll make much more sense. [CLS] [SEP]but basically you want to practice a bunch of times with a bunch of different looks on your test page with your arms .i won ?t do that right now because there 's literally dozens of things you can do but just know that , i do n't know , for a pose like this we want to keep it kind of safe and neutral looking. [CLS] [SEP]so we 're going to give her her arms resting on her hips .so what we 'll do is we 'll move on now to do the hips .
first of all , we take white sauce .now white sauce is prepared out of butter , flour and milk .now we add cabbage and carrot to it and then pepper and some salt .now mix this well and then take a slice of bread .spread this mixture all over the slice and then place another slice of bread on this .and then , place it on the toaster and leave it for three to four minutes .so now , after four minutes , your toast is ready .so let 's see .now we take this toast , since it 's properly toasted , place it on a plate. [CLS] [SEP]and then we can have it with either tomato ketchup or maybe mustard sauce , as per your wish .so here you go , your toast is ready .
did you know leeks are one of the most cold tolerant of all the vegetables ?they can withstand temperatures down to about five degrees fahrenheit without dying .hi .i 'm jarrett from stone soup farm .and this is how to grow leeks .leeks are best planted in the spring , as soon as you can work the soil .they can survive through the spring frosts , even those little seedlings .and so , as soon as you can get in there , you can plant leek seeds .i like to do about three or four per clump .and the clumps are about a foot apart from each other , in rows that are about 18 inches from each other .it 's best to have well-drained soil with lots of compost or manure incorporated in beforehand .keep them well-watered and weed free throughout the season for the best yields .there is no such thing as too late to harvest leeks .they pretty much will last in the field all summer .as soon as they 're as big as you 'd like them to be , you can harvest then eat them , or you can leave them .they last quite well into the fall and even into the winter , you can come out and harvest .when you 're ready to eat them , you just grab and rip it out of the ground .it 'll have a few gross leaves on the outside , which you can pull off .and underneath , you 've got a lovely leek .like i said though , they do n't store quite as well once they 're harvested , but you can harvest them any time of year .so just leave them in the ground , and get them when you 're ready .i 'm jarrett from stone soup farm .and that 's how to grow leeks .
now we 're going to talk about a shuffle .shuffle is one of the most basic components of a tap step .it makes two sounds , first you start in the back , kick front , and then pull back using the flat part of your tap .you can also do a shuffle faster , you just need to loosen up your ankle , so pull front , back , front , back .you can also do a shuffle to the front , side , or to the back .now i 'm going to do the shuffle to the left side .starting slow , brush front , back .to the side , you 'd go front , back .to the back you 're going to kick more to the side .and then faster .
again you want to do this in small , circular motions , very cold , hold your breath .this is like getting in the pool for the first time where the waist line is the coldest .we naturally tan a little darker in our tummy area. [CLS] [SEP]so your spray tan is going to actually be a little darker .your skin on your chest is not very porous so be really careful to just do a light spray in that area because that 's going to be the first area to cause you drips and runs .again we 're just going to lightly. [CLS] [SEP], you can actually see the tan developing .so that 's the belly and the chest .see how that 's starting to run ?sorry ashley .so we 're good .that 's gotten that area spray tanned and we 're ready to move to the next area .
i 'm nancy frensley with the berkeley east bay humane society in berkeley , california .we 're here to talk about newfoundlands .the newfoundland or newfies as they are called by the people who love and keep them are a very very giant dog that was originally bred to save people out in the stormy arctic seas. [CLS] [SEP]and so your newfoundland has a really heavy coat , a very big body and most of them love to swim .they come in a couple of varieties .most of the times you see the black ones. [CLS] [SEP]but sometimes you see these very handsome black and white ones and those are called landseer newfoundlands .so your newfoundland is going to need a lot of care .they should not be jumping a lot .they 're a very large dog and landing , that big body is very hard on their bones .they 're generally a pretty slow moving affectionate happy dog that will just do about anything for you and a lot of people. [CLS] [SEP]really really enjoy taking them swimming and boating .
and i am with united studios of self defense. [CLS] [SEP]and we are going to do a bit on stretching and flexibility for the martial arts .there are a couple basic types of stretches and some of them are appropriate at different times .the most common stretch that most people know about are what we call static stretches , where you are just sitting in one spot , holding a stretch .and then there are more of your active , your dynamic stretches where you are doing certain kinds of motions that more accurately mimic natural things that you would do , no doubt creating flexibility and to warm your muscles up a little bit .now generally it is a bad idea to do static stretches where you are completely cold because you are pulling on a muscle that does not really want to move that much .and usually you will be causing tearing or potential damage where the , everything is the weakest which is usually a lot of times where the muscle meets on to the bone which could be a bad idea .so basically what we are going to do. [CLS] [SEP]is we are going to warm everyone up from the ground up .we are going to start with the ankles and then just make the way all the way up the body .and a lot of our stretches are going to be slightly in motion so that way it is not hard on the body. [CLS] [SEP], it is a little more natural with what you are going to be doing in martial arts anyways , and it is actually going to be elevating your body temperature just a little bit .it is usually a good idea before you switch from these active stretches that we are going to start with to the static stretches where you are sitting still , it is usually a good idea if possible to try to have at least just the tiniest bit of moisture on your forehead .so often times you can get that with doing most of these stretches that we are going to be going into in a moment .but if you do n't have that , just keep repeating them or even do some jumping jacks and quick squats to continue trying to warm up a little bit .so the first thing we are going to do is to try it , is you are just going to simply take and just going to put the tip of his toe on the ground. [CLS] [SEP]and he is going to start creating a circle with his foot , trying to just get the ankle warmed up .it just starts drawing blood down the body and getting everything down there and towards the foot .now just switch directions , and we are just going to switch over on the other side , just keep everything going a little bit .it also starts to relax the muscle a little bit just from the rhythmic circuit of motion , and notice he switched over to the other side as he is keeping everything going there and switch .and then it kind of gets the toes warmed up and everything too .sometimes you get these injuries in extremities , you know , just because they are , you know , they are a little bit cold , they are not stretched out , they are not warmed up .so toes can be , you know , a thing you can kind of strain a little bit or possibly ankles .
i 'm with the hospice of the florida sun coast , and. [CLS] [SEP]i 'm here to tell you , how to avoid getting fired at your office christmas party .first of all , the main thing you need to remember is , it is an office christmas party , that means that you need to behave in the same way that you 're going to behave in the office .now , you are there to have fun , you 're there to have a good time and let loose , but there are some boundaries that you need to worry about .second is , if there 's alcohol being served , be careful you remember how many drinks you had , one , maybe two. [CLS] [SEP], that 's enough .feel free to bring somebody with you .usually these events will let you bring a partner or spouse , and make certain that they understand that this is your office christmas party , and that they 're going to have to behave professionally as well .your buddies are going to be there , it 's a nice time to cut loose , but your boss is going to be there too , so you do have to be concerned to balance those two , have a good time , feel free to dance , get out ,have a couple of drinks , but just do it in moderation .again , my name is wade childress from the hospice florida sun coast , and i 've told you , how to avoid getting fired at your office christmas party .thank you .
and i manipulate that back and forth by chipping small flakes off into fatter areas that i can take off bigger flakes .i got one problem on this rock right here , and there 's a divot right here .that 's called a hinge fracture .if i were to hit right here again , try to take off a flake this way , it would dive in there , hit that wall and break off again. [CLS] [SEP]and then the hinge would get bigger .so , what i have to do it some behind it , either on this side or that side and. [CLS] [SEP]kind of crawl back behind it and see if i can roll it out of there .this stone is really forgiving and allows you to do that pretty easily .i come back behind it a little bit , not quite all the way. [CLS] [SEP]so i 'm going to go on the other side .and that one just sucked right around the back side and pretty much got rid quite a bit of it .i 'll just keep doing that till that problem 's over with .i either did n't hit it right , back when i was making the bi-face or something. [CLS] [SEP], there might have been an inclusion in the rock there or something .anyway , it 's no big problem right now .well , i guess i have to come from the other side .or just leave it alone .it 'll come out in the long run anyway .this is so close to the edge .i 'll go for a good hit here and see if i can just take it off .that sounded good and it sounded like it went all the way across .so , there 's your flake , pulled off the hinge and thinned at the same time .so , we 're in great shape right now .
now that my loop is all lined up , now i can actually format and arrange the loops that i have right now .usually i 'll break down my drums a little bit even more .i 'll do snare by itself and every little sound , but for learning purposes , i grouped a bunch of them together .with this , my bars are already linked up. [CLS] [SEP]so i can look at this - this grid right now in the background. [CLS] [SEP]is basically telling me that these four bars are what i got , so i can press apple d to duplicate bars that i have .i could also press option r and repeat it and do the exact same thing .i could also copy paste with the apple c/apple. [CLS] [SEP]v. [CLS] [SEP]i could also cut with apple x , if i want to delete certain things i could delete certain parts out of it .so i 'll show you .
