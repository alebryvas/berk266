after you 've done at least six to twelve rounds of sun salutation in sivananda yoga we start on the main practice .we will begin with leg raises .it really helps open up the core , strengthen the core , and it 's just a wonderful way to start .so i 'm going to have lauren here lay down on her back .beautiful .now bring your arms down to your sides , palms on the earth .if you need any little assistance in this , because it is a lot of core work through here , you can place the hands underneath the hips if you need just a little bit of assistance .when i ask lauren here to engage the feet , nice deep flexion of the feet .pressing through the heels , toes to the nose .and we 're going to start with single leg.
a hook spotter cause some of this wood is kind of hard , kind of hard , kind of hard .no hook on my potential piece.
now hand washing is actually one of the best ways to prevent catching a cold .the germs that you would catch , travel through your hands onto other parts of your body , specifically your face .most colds come from direct contact that you 're having with somebody else who has the virus .often times that 's like shaking hands with somebody , being in close quarters , hugging , touching ,anything when you 're close with somebody else , sharing things , touching the same glass , touching the same silverware , touching the same food , stuff like that .so what you should do is constantly be washing your hands , especially if you 're traveling or if you 're in close quarters with people or you 're exposed to someone who might be sick .always be washing your hands and do it with warm water and soap , wash vigorously for at least 20 seconds to make sure you loosen up all the germs .now , you wo n't always have access to warm water and soap , so what you should do is carry hand sanitizer .i always keep some hand sanitizer with me , in my car , in a bag with me if i 'm traveling.
the other way we can do cucumbers which is also very nice is on these pickling cucumbers i find out that works out the best because they are firmer is to slice them diagonally .same thing about 1/8 '' to 1/4 ''you can cut them a little bit thicker if were going to use this style because well you 'll see why what were going to do once we 're doing this .turn them on the side we 're going to cut them into strips and that ones are pickled.
and i 'm going to talk about putting photographic emulsion onto watercolor paper .now photographs have an emulsion on them .and what i can do , is i can heat up this emulsion and light , tight space , using a red photographic safe light .and i can paint this photographic emulsion onto watercolor paper .and then i can print using traditional photographic techniques in a dark room .and i like this especially because i can make photographs that are n't necessarily just flat on plastic .i can put them on watercolor paper , i can make cards out of them , i can make even really beautiful painterly-esque images .and so that is one way that i can kind of create a style for myself using photographic emulsion that i 've painted onto watercolor paper .
in this episode , we 're actually going to use an interesting technique that combines bleeding acupuncture along with cuppings , very commonly used for heat syndromes as well as for pain .so this is a great choice for back pain .once again , we 're going to swab the area to make sure that it 's sterile .in this case , we use a lancet which is very similar to a diabetic 's use if they 're checking their blood sugar .and now , we utilize the cup again in the same fashion and we 'll place that over the location.
alright , some of the terminology is balls and strikes , and we call two balls and one strike ,of course everyone knows you only get three strikes .four balls , you take your base , hit by a pitch , take your base .now you 'll see me , it has a clicker in it , this is an indicator .as you can see , the game ended 1-1 count , and there was 2 outs .now , let 's say the game went on .watch this -there 's ball two , strike two .ball three , we call that a full count .ball four , take your base .go back to zero , start all over again .make sure you reset your indicator after every batter , because otherwise you could start with 4-0 , that does n't work .reset it 0-0.see that 0-0 ?ball 1 , strike 1 , strike 2 , strike 3.
laptop video cards are not upgradeable and another thing about them is you could always look at what kind you have by going to start control panel system.
cause i have a child that like to poke things down in it .okay .well do you think the damage is ?well a standard tuning is going to be $ 95 , the rest of it would depend with what is going on .pulling things out is not expensive pulling things out are free and sometimes you really find some really interesting things .but we could get to that point.
so to position the feet as our foundation , always want to start with the feet in the standing poses .from foundations build strong houses.
we 're going to let this cook well until our butter has just about melted down .and then we 're just going to dump it straight into our pan.
okay.
the drink we are about to make is called a bat bite.
pose 11 in the sivananda series is utanasana , standing forward fold , and sue 's going to demonstrate for us .so i 'm going to have you standing facing this way .start into dasana pose .it 's basically stacking one part of the body onto the next , so go through the steps .bring your toes a little bit closer together than the heels .wonderful , strong thighs .engage those thighs .tuck the tail bone , hollow the belly and relax the shoulders back down , away .yes , gently drop the chin .you want the chin kind of parallel to the ground , the crown of the head reaching for the ceiling .alright , coming into the forward fold , arms to the sides , inhaling up .as you exhale , swan dive forward fold .she is bending from the hips , beautiful .the first thing i 'm going to have you do is grab a hold of either side of the elbow .using the weight of her arms and the weight of her head to really start that good stretch .now in this pose you 're getting a nice lower back stretch , you 're also stretching your hamstrings .so holding this just a little bit in the beginning .do you feel the stretch in the back of the legs ?yes .nice .gently release the elbow .now taking your hands beside your feet you 're going to lower back just a little bit , and please feel free to micro bend the knees if you need to .beautiful .the crown of the head just completely towards the mat , relax the neck completely , and coming out of it very slowly .inhale , reverse swan dive all the way up , take a nice back bend to counteract the fold .inhale up , straight spine , exhale , heart center .
in this clip we 'll talk about afternoon tea .another sport of tea dear .but of course , thank you .i 'll also take some of the sweets please .oh excellent .what is the story with these tiny little sandwiches and cakes ?it all started with lady bedford .in the 1800s lady bedford , usually right in the afternoon around four or five o'clock , would get these hunger pains because the time between lunch and dinner was just too long .in those days lunch was typically served at eight o'clock.
there 's so many funny moments as a music producer.
so if we 're going to play a basic drum beat in 6/8 , that would be the paradiddle diddle .the problem is when your playing a drum fill , typically , as there 's exceptions to every rule , but you do n't go backwards around the drums meaning you do n't start with a lower drum , the lower pitched drum , and do a drum fill going up .has it been done ?yes .will it be done in the future ?yes .do people do it today ?yes .it 's just an unnatural thing for a couple of reasons .one , the pitch , and secondly , your body is not used to going this way around the drum kit .okay , it goes this way around the drum kit , it 's more efficient .so the paradiddle diddle does n't make sense in that way .yeah.
in this segment , we 're going to talk about the diminished triad , the diminished 7th , the difference between a diminished 7th and a minor 7 flat 5.there is a little bit of a difference .i 'll also be showing you the functions.
this is riley , and he is going to help me , today , to talk to you about children that may have growing pains , and how a message might be a beneficial way of helping them to release some of the aches and pains , and discomfort associated with growing pains .growing pains can typically affect children between the ages of three and five , and then again between of eight and twelve .but these are simply guidelines because it can affect a child anytime .it can be something that causes discomfort in different parts of their legs , in the fronts , the backs , some children may have ashcan slaughters , which could cause pain up in the knee area , other children may have ciphers which could cause some kind of discomfort in their ankle area , which is more of a inflammation of growth plates , but this message could still be helpful and beneficial to help alleviate some of those aches and pains .even children that run around and play , lots and lots , can get aches and pains in their legs and they may not exactly be growing pains , but these message strokes and techniques can be helpful even in those situations .so , hope that you 'll find the next bits of information useful .
and then we see that we have to redo that fin and that one also and this one too and this too .mainly , it was the fins .okay , sorry , fish .okay , now that we have mainly the fish shape , we have to try to separate it from the base because it sticks .that 's why we spread it across the -- in there .but for the shape that we have-that made eyes , i have better idea .okay , now it looks like --this goes lower .then we are going to make the fins pattern that always they have this kind of radius bones , and we can do it , of course , like this .but we 're going to do it better with a too , but.
there really is a surprise in the center of the cupcake .my 2 favorite things to put together in this world are chocolate and peanut butter .in my book , that just means perfection right there .these cupcakes are chocolate cupcakes , which i have 2 secret ingredients in the cupcakes , in the cake parts themselves .they 're going to be so moist , you 'll want to eat them just by themselves .if you 're anything like me , that 's not normal , but trust me , they 're going to be fantastically moist cupcakes .there 's going to be a surprise in the center of that .we 're going to put in a peanut butter cup in the center of the cupcake for a little surprise when you bite into it .i know , it 's already sounding amazing .then on top , we 're going to have a very light whipped peanut butter frosting with just a little bit of chocolate in that too .ca n't go wrong with that .all over it 's great .every bite has great flavor , lots of chocolate and peanut butter in every single bite .this frosting is great by itself .the cupcakes are great by itself .i could just eat a million of the little reese 's peanut butter cups that are going in the center of them .fantastic cupcakes .let 's get started .
so the last material or supply that you 'll need to have is a workable fixative spray .you can purchase these at any art supply store as well as hardware stores.
in a single straight leg stretch , take your right hand on the back of the right leg for the hamstring .and take your left hand down to that right ankle .it can be done in different levels , you can be up on your tail bone , you can come down your lower back .some people , if they have a problem where their neck bothers them , can lay the head down .push forward to connect deeper into the back and the abdominals , hold your head up .now take a deep breath in , and switch both legs over towards the left leg and you 're bringing that leg in straight towards you and then exhale , switch .and inhale , switch .inhale and exhale , use the breath .inhaling and exhaling .extending with the toes and again , if your neck bothers you , bring your head down .but it wo n't work as deeper into the back and abdominal muscles as it is when you lift the head up .and up back and forth .pointing like.

in this clip we 're going to be covering goals for your play .now it 's helpful that during your writing process that you have an idea of what you 're ultimately going to do with the play .an important resource book you might want to take a look at is the writer 's market , which comes out once a year .it lists all sorts of companies that accept writing , from books to articles and they usually have a section on plays as well .and it will list theater companies and what types of plays they 're looking for .it may even list the maximum number of characters that they expect , and it will give contact information too , so it can be really valuable , even while you 're writing the play , to be investigating it and not wait until your play is totally finished .now another option is competitions and contests .maybe you 'll pick up a little cash if you win a contest , but the real value is in getting exposure for your work , getting people to see it .and often that can be a big boost into getting it produced if you 've had some winnings on that .now another option is to produce the play yourself .now the trick there is that promotion gets very very expensive , but if you know of a space or even a lot of schools or churches will have spaces or stages that they 'd be willing to rent you for your play .now promotion is very important and you might even want to start your own website if you do n't have one already , or create one specifically for your writing where a production company who gets your submission , or anyone you contact about your writing about doing a play on their venue , they can look up your website and see that you are a serious playwright .now i mentioned the writer 's market , but there are all kinds of books out there about writing , and what you might do is look for books in the specific area where you really feel you need the most boost .if you seem to have trouble creating characters or working on dialog or coming up with entire story , check out a book or a guide along those lines .also a guide on play form , even though you may know the basics , a guide may give you details.
i say first layer , because you can do two , three , or four layers of this combination if you want to .but this is the first layer of soundboard attached to the z channel .i 've attached , with screws , wherever there is not a stud .the idea is i do n't want to go through the soundboard into the stud.
once you have the angles of the feet positioned , then just move the forward knee directly over the ankle and also make sure that the kneecap is directly above the second toe .you can kind of check this out from the side if you need to in the beginning , until you know where the , that position comes for you .this is bringing safety for the knee and aligning the shin bone so that it 's straight .yoga 's a lot about physics.
so after you 've established the border with your artist tape and taped your mat board down to your working surface , your next step is to choose your image for working with .so here again i have a few different types of images that you can work with .the reason that i 've chosen to xerox copy this is because working in a gray scale tracing is actually a little bit easier to define edges as well as differences in variation of color rather than dealing with so many different colors in one piece .so here is an image already call it a ready image that you want to work from .or , a drawing that maybe , perhaps you 've done on another paper that you 'd like to see turned into a collage .or a drawing that somebody else has done for you .whatever the case may be .you can trace it onto some velan or tracing paper and then transfer the image which i 'll be showing you just a little bit later onto your working surface .and then you also have the option of drawing directly onto the board itself , freehand drawing .depending on what type of work you 're looking to achieve .
next we need to rotate it in a counter clockwise fashion off of the vacuum adapter .you might need to wiggle that just a little bit to pull that off .next we need to invert the bag over a trash can and empty out all of our dust .now not all of it will come out.
that can be done .this is by application of stickers .let me show you a sheet of stickers .as you can see you can there are pieces that are round.
how do you teach your children self defense ?i have a seven year old and a five year old and we 're dealing with this all the time .in schools there is typically a zero tolerance for striking , even if it 's in self defense.
i 'm living in salt lake city .we 're going to talk about who lives at a certain address .there might be any number of reasons why you might want to know who is living at a certain address for either personal reasons or business reasons .one method to determine that is a reverse address look up on line .you type in the address.
you would use that for working on a package , for example .when i do a package which is a completely pre-produced story , i need to make sure that my voice part of that is properly recorded , and so you would come into an audio booth like this .you would have your script with you .your script will just be the information that you plan to read , and it 's already timed out because your story timing is very important .and you have to make it fit with the other sound bites in the story and the other elements of that story .so you would have your script .you would come into the audio booth , and this would be being recorded either in here or some other source , some other location .and i would read my script in a fashion that made sense that followed the script and sounded natural because no one 's going to see me in here doing this .it 's all going to be recorded on tape somewhere and without my picture , and it 's going to be -- then put into that story as just an audio file .so i will record the voice , and later on , i will put the video over top of that , and i will incorporate the sound bites .and i will then take all of that material , put it together into one complete and finished story .
you need to add red chili , this much will go .we need to add tumeric powder , say a little bit just for the taste , for the sake of adding it , and we need to add to , gel it well .as you can see that it has come in to a nice combination , is n't it .this is the actual stuffing which will go into the stuffed tomatoes .put the fennel seeds from the top .it has to be now a bigger quantity , gel it well and then add green chili to it .the green chili 's has to be in big quantity , like this much .basically we want to make a spicy , spicy recipe , add a little bit more .
we 're going to pour everything into the food processor and we 're going to start mixing it together until it would be nicely grounded .i do n't put all the oil together.
ok , the first thing that we deal with in the yellow belt criteria , are attacks from behind .ushiro tekubi tori .ushiro means behind , tekubi is wrists that are held behind the back , basically .so , ushiro tekubi tori is two hands held behind the back .we do this two ways , statics to learn it , and then in motion .so in static , the first thing i tell people from this position is do n't let your person pull you back off balance .drop your center , bring your hands slightly forward .you 'll notice that i 'm standing in a stance , kanme , or hanme , my left foot is forward .i never stand with my legs like this because he can push me forward , or pull me back , it does n't really matter .one way or the other .so my left foot is forward .the first thing that i do for ushiro tekubi tori kokyunage , is i leave this hand down .this hand turns in front of me , notice i do n't try to raise my arm up , because i do n't have any strength this way .i rotate it in front of me .i follow the direction of my hand up , and i just pivot just like this .all i do now is step , and drop my arms .true , this looks a little goofy , and most people are not going to attack you like this on the street , but this teaches you some very good principles of learning to split the person 's energy .his mind can only really work in one way , one time .and with neko it probably works less than that .but , for a normal person , up and down , spread the person out , and cut them down .one more time .one , two , three .in motion , it looks like this .he moves around , i blend with him , up , down , and around .it 's very important to blend with this attack ; do n't become rigid and have him pull you off balance .relax .as he comes around , i step with him , then i turn and close the door , projecting him forward .one , two , three .
all you need is to wet it down in the sink .use your regular dishwashing detergent and sponge to gently clean it off .if you have something that is baked on like.
another variation of the butterfly is commonly known as the wave , although it is also referred to as many other names , depending on who you talk to .there 's also many variations of how this move is done , but basically it 's a low , version of the butterfly , back and forth , behind the body .so now we are entering in , the plain that is behind us as well , as in front of us .another way to do.
okay here 's the cha cha pattern on the drum set with accented eighths on the ride cymbal .okay let 's break this down a little bit .with the left hand we have a conga pattern , cross stick and then doubles on the toms coinciding .of course this starts on beat two , on beat one.
so lying in a supine position , which means face up , place the heels on top of the ball , and the arms could just rest gently to the side , i 'm going to be pushing down with my heels , driving my heels through the ball , as i extend the ball out and , particularly , when i pull the ball in .so if you can see , i 'm rolling from heel to toe .so the resistance is coming right now as i 'm pushing down.
certain things you should remember is having a flashlight nearby your bed because when smoke happens , it could be really dark .as any electronic device , you should always check that the batteries work annually or maybe semi-annually .another thing that you should keep in mind is the seriousness of a fire .maybe you should have the time to talk to your children about how feeling fire is a very serious matter and should only be done in serious cases as a true emergency .other things to keep in mind is to alert the household members would be whistles or other such powerful devices so that everybody can wake up if they were sleeping during this time of need .remember that fires are a very serious matter and your children should be able to take care of themselves as well as to alert everybody in the household .children should not be relying on just the parents but should be able to visit the building on their own and alert everybody in the household just as well as any other adult .
and today we are shooting here from mckay 's hedge row .we are standing in front of the american fort right now .we are going to talk about paintball fields and size and some of the things you need to have a good paintball field .you need a good safe area where people can go and take their masks off , look at their guns and make sure everything is working right , cool down , eating a snack , access to water is always good and if not bring coolers of water .you do n't need anyone getting sick .we have two separate safe areas .we have the first safe area which we park our vehicles in and the second safe area is more of a staging area once we decide what kind of game we are going to play .we come out in to that area and if you get out you go back to the safe area and wait for everybody else .it is always good to let your neighbors know what you are doing.
a trouser pant is a nice slim fitting jean .these are denim , you may not be able to see that.
we left off at high pat on horse .we 're going to move onto a series of kicks .one of my favorite moves is strike tiger 's ears .we pivot , kick left .then , the move is called creep low like snake to golden wrist , stands on one leg .we do it on the other side , to fair lady work shadows.
the actions are always open , always open .now when carrying a shotgun in and around a shotgun range , what we suggest is that you can take your arm , put it right up underneath , and carry the shotgun like this .but as you see , you have absolute control of that muzzle , always have control ; you can see where it is .one of the other things that you can do , if this is not comfortable for you , you can actually take and drop it over your shoulder and now you can grab the muzzle or up here at the forearm.
if your cat has been having some soft stool or diarrhea , you 'd want to collect that portion of the feces for your veterinarian to take.
the next thing is drinking a lot of water .my personal belief with what i 've studied is that most of the drinks that we are drinking on a daily basis are actually dehydrating us and we 're drinking them instead of water .so there 's things you can do in your company in your corporate headquarters such as having water coolers , bottled water , whatever .and it needs to be water without chlorine by the way because these chemicals are part of the major problem with health .but water is the thing that god really gave us to flush the system .and our cells need to be hydrated and if they 're not hydrated what happens.
in this clip , we 're going to be talking about multi-point systems .now , in some indoor leagues , they have more than just the three red lines .they 'll have like an extra rim , which is pretty similar to maybe a three point line in basketball .so it 's going to be further away from the goal and much harder to score .but they 'll award you possibly an extra goal for scoring from out there .also to remember that if you are playing coed , that some places will determine that a girl 's goal will be worth two goals and a guy 's goal will be only worth one .so remember to keep your female players up front and towards the opponent 's goal .because their goals will be worth more and if you can put your females in scoring position , the odds are , you 'll probably win the game .in this clip , we 're going to be talking about accessories .now , some indoor facilities do n't really regulate what you 're allowed to wear and what you 're not allowed to wear .but , it 's highly recommended that you do n't wear any form of jewelry , whether it is wrist bracelets , ear rings , necklaces .because those could be tugged on or grabbed during the game and could cause harm to someone else or yourself .now , say that you have an injury that requires a cast , or a sling , or some sort of support .a lot of times people will not let you play with a cast unless there is foam covering over the cast.
hi , i 'm emily larew .we 're continuing on with our tap combination for beginners .we 're going to start with counts one through four .so we just did our heel , bow ,whack , we can up down , we 're going to stomp on our left foot towards the wall .alright , in our direction .so , if we 're facing the audience , it will be stage right , so we 're going to stomp towards stage right .and eight , you 're going to stomp .one , you 're going to scuff , and half step , hop , step .so good , try that again .we have stomp , scuff , hop , step .and as you can tell , i 'm making sure every one of my sounds even the hop , is clear , alright .seven and eight , we have one , and two , and what you 're going to do is take that left foot.
in the next clip , let 's look and see how we start to move the arms curving space correctly .we 're starting with the spanish fifth position , with the arms turn back a little bit more in an exaggerated style , keep your tail bone tucked under , keep your shoulders back and down .take the right arm and very slowly start to move the arm down to what i call spanish second position .notice that my elbow is sticking it , and that the elbow is higher than the wrist , and the wrist is higher than my fingers .as i carved through the space , i come down to the first position , i keep the elbow sticking out so that as i start to return to fifth , i let the upper arm lead , the elbow sticking out and the last part of the arm to con-finish the movement would be the fingers .i can repeat this on the left side , bringing the arm down , down , down and up .
, feel like they 're special .to start off with , give each birthday guest a name tag and have them write something creative about them on the name tag .so maybe that can start off a conversation .then when all the birthday guest arrive , have them introduce themselves and tell how they know the special person 's day .that can start another conversation as well .then you always want to be aware during games , especially for younger ones , some birthday guest may tend to get a little sad or feel like they 're not included , so always keep your eyes open for birthday guest who feel like they been left out .then before each person leaves , you want to make sure they have some type of party favor or gift to take home with them .keep in mind , you want everyone to feel special , almost like it 's kind of their day too and always have fun .
so you just want to fill it up just to how much you 're gon na use it that day .secondly , you want to make sure that your grinds are fine , but still have a bit of coarseness to them .now to set your grind , there 's usually a lever on the side of the grinder you can adjust .the last part is that you have to make sure that you fill up your porta filter above the rim .as you see , i have a little mountain here .the next thing you want to do is get rid of some of the grinds and.
emil lamprecht :the next trick.
get your stance .make sure there 's nothing behind you , we do n't want to be stepping into anything .we step back , and down , and forward .this one involves a bit more of a push off the back leg to come back into position .all the other rules for lunges apply .we want our feet like this , we do n't want them on one track.
as a right handed person it would seem more easier for me now to throw the ball but as a left handed quarterback , it is a little more difficult just like it was for the right hand quarterback with the left leg down .so right now we are going to do the same thing .we are going to emphasize the trunk turn .turn trunk , throw .we 've got to turn , throw .there you go .when you get that ball , turn that trunk .throw .there you go .you 've got to make sure you emphasize on the turn the trunk .it is very very important .
okay , the first thing i 'm going to show you today.
you 've got the cold on this side and the hot on this side and the way it works is that it seeps up against here and when this twists.
when selecting a telescope for astronomy , aperture is actually the most important feature , you want to consider .now , aperture , is a fancy word for the light gathering ability of your telescope .how much light it can soak up , how big your lens or your mirror may be , in this case .the light gathering ability of the telescope , is important , because that 's what makes those distant objects , seem a bit brighter , those dim fuzzies that we look for .you see further back in time , if you will , with a larger aperture telescope .the magnification that you 'll get with your telescope , will also depend on the aperture here , but typically seeing conditions permit that we use right about a hundred magnifications , or so , kind of a sweet spot for astronomy , and i say that though , even though a big scope like this , is capable of much more magnification , than the little guy i 've got right here .typically , my seeing conditions outside do n't allow me to do more than about , i 'm going to say , a hundred and twenty , a hundred and fifty magnification , with any of the instruments that i have here , and one of the reasons is , that our location here in anacortes , where it 's sea level .we 've got ten thousand feet of atmosphere to focus through , so.
chest , shoulders , and back with a strap .you want to choose a strap that is not stretching but is firm.
i like to use kosher salt .you need a half teaspoon , about 1 to 2 pinches , of thyme .you can use fresh thyme if you want to , but right now we do n't have any around .about the same amount of oregano .maybe a little bit more .then half a teaspoon of black pepper .
you want to take some chicken wire , and you want to cut it about as wide as the opening of your rain stick .so you , you judge how many across that would be .use wire cutters or scissors and cut your chicken wire .once your chicken wire is cut , you have a strip of chicken wire , and you 're going to simply insert it into the tube .now , as it goes into the tube you may have to squeeze your tube to get it to fit .and you kind of want to twist it as it goes so that it will be spiraling inside of your tube and do a better job of filtering .sometimes you may have to bend the wire up or down .but it does n't matter because the whole idea is to have a filter that the , that the filler will filter through as it goes .you could also make another tube of this chicken wire if you wanted to so that you would have even more of a filter as you 're filling whatever it is goes through it .so you kind of have to play with it a little bit .make sure it 'll fit inside of your tube because you ca n't reach up in and pull it .so you insert your chicken wire in your tube .and if it 's , if it 's difficult you can also put a string or something on the end and stick it through so can help to pull it through if it gets stuck as it 's going through .once your chicken wire is in place all the way through , you 're going to want to look at that end .make sure that it is the way you want it to be coming through .and then you want to cap off one end .and then you 'll be ready to either fill it or decorate it before you put a cap on the other end .and that 's how you can use chicken wire as another kind of filter for your rain stick .
well now that we 've brought the kids back inside and we 're trying to warm them back up and give them a little bit of a treat , we are going to make something called maple snow taffy .in order to make maple snow taffy you have to heat up 100 % maple syrup .it has to be 100 % pure maple syrup .you 're going to heat that up basically slowly till it gets to the point to where it is boiling .as you can see that 's probably a good amount , i think we 're probably going to be making two different little servings of the snow taffy , so that should work nicely for it .as far as the brand , it does n't matter , you can use whatever brand you 'd like or if you have a particular favorite.
we 're talking about how to spin around a bo staff .there 's many , many different ways to spin a bo staff around , so you ca n't really hold yourself to one .the best thing to do is go out into your backyard , just start experimenting around with this , and see what really works for you .to start out with a few basics , obviously , just something that is really not practical , but it just looks cool .you can add it in to your forms , or into your cottas , or anything that you make up , is just to take the bo staff , spin it around , and take one hand off , catch it on the other side , and just continue to flip , left or right hand ,whichever you start out with .i 'm starting with my left hand here , and just flipping it around .just make sure you keep it near the center .if you get off and you start sliding down , which is very easy , your weight is going to be unevenly distributed , and you could possibly lose your bo staff .another way , adding in strikes into spinning your bo staff , is to take , have the left hand palm down , the right hand palm up .what i do , is.
okay , so we got our panel , we got our topstitch , and it 's not perfectly smooth and everything , but after you do all your topstitching and pressing , it 's not a bad idea to go ahead and just re-iron the fabric .get the last little bit of wrinkles out , and the remaining wrinkles , if there are any , when we stretch the canvas , that will actually pull the fabric really tight , and you 'll see that there really are n't any wrinkles on this one .it kind of stretches the fabric to its amazing smooth finish .so , i 'm just going to finish ironing this , and then once you get that area , just set your iron to the side and you can slide it back .just keep this here .keep your cord out of the way 'cause that will add wrinkles .look at that .let 's get that side , and you can just come back and get this end .start that way again .and i 'm ironing on the inside because the seams are there .so , all right ; we 're ready for the next step .
i 've been keeping reptile amphibians for over forty years , i 'm here to talk to you about keeping gray tree frogs .gray tree frogs are native to , basically , the eastern half of the us and they are common mostly in the northeast , i live in austin.
in this segment , we 're going to work on that same idea as we did in the last , using the six harmonies with an arm lock .but we 're going to do it as a partner exercise , to not only learn how to do this movement , but if done correctly with really nice intent , it 's actually a really great stretch and movement exercise for each partner .and learning how to listen .so if ray locks me up here , and then i do my movement , i come around , and now i keep coming around , keep coming around , i get him in the situation , then he pulls his hips under , comes around , gets me .i pull my hips under.
back in nineteen-ninety-six , when i first started racing supercross , pretty much all you had to do to get your supercross license was fill out a paper and send in a bunch of money .they gave it to anybody and everybody .nowadays it 's not quite so easy .the first step in getting your supercross license is actually getting your motocross license .there are several series you can ride to accumulate points to get your motocross license .there is also the ama national arenacross series which will give you points to earn not only your motocross license.
okay .now we 're going to put just a short but more complicated course together .what we 'll do is.
, that 's visible from all directions .i 'm.
so if you are living in a multiple dog household and you got one or two dogs that jump .so if you got a puppy that you are introducing to the household and you want to teach them how to jump it is important that you work with one dog at a time .you can see here.
a lot of people have a lot of the misconception that a lot of keyboardist will play style that was really popular in the '70s with the hammond b-3.
in this clip we are going to do a one leg balance with rotation .now you want to step to where you feel like you are nice and stable on the balance trainer , body should be nice and relaxed , knees slightly bent , shoulders relaxed .you are going to start off with the basic option , you are going to come up on your toe , arms out to the side and for some people.
tip number 2 : size .when we 're considering the size of jewelry that we 're going to put on our client , the first thing we think of is the size of the person .measure your height and your weight and determine what your bone size is in relation to your body .this can help you figure out if you want a chunkier jewelry , a more delicate jewelry , or something in between .for larger women we recommend chunky jewelry to help proportionalize the body and give a slimming affect .for extremely petite women , they ca n't carry off chunky jewelry as well because it overwhelms them and makes them look like they 're drowning in their jewelry .so very petite women need to stay with a more delicate or chain oriented jewelry , for the most part .again this is not a hard and fast rule .it 's just a guideline to help you begin your selection .and for men we always recommend a chunkier , more solid form of jewelry because this almost always looks best with most men 's frames .
then , i ca n't teach you much about clock repair in a short clip , but we can talk for a minute about why a clock may not be running .seems , as i 'm doing clock repair work , people are often surprised , even angry , if their clock has stopped , and i ask : ``well , when 's the last time you had it serviced ? ''and : `` oh ! we 've never had to have this serviced .this clock 's been perfect for years .
in this segment i am going to talk about ball position .where you play the ball in your stance , is tremendously important .if you play the ball too far up , i 'm exaggerating , but if you play too far up , you have to make a compensation to hit the ball straight .if you play the ball too far back , you have to make a compensation to hit the ball straight .now those examples are exaggerated .subtle differences can also make a tremendous difference .in other words , if the ball is a little too far up , you might have to make compensation .if the ball is a little too far back you might have to make compensation .so the question is where you do put the ball , and the answer is where you would put the nail and the hammer .if we have a nail right here.
we will demonstrate today how we shave or remove hair on arms .the best way we have to see how hair grows , which direction it grows .i see from this direction to this direction hair is growing .we could remove it with wax perfectly .we have wax here.
before the use of papers in smoking tobacco , most americans used the simple corn cob pipe .smoking tobacco has progressed quite always since using the corn cob pipe .we 've come from roll your own tobacco in papers , to being able to roll your own with a machine , such as this zigzag machine .and now we even have a more advanced style , which is a empty tube filter .with an empty tube filter , we are able to use this new type of machine , to be able to load up a filtered cigarette with our own cheap , loose leaf tobacco , using one of these tubes .now to do this , we take our loose leaf tobacco , add a little bit of it into the center .spread it out evenly .compress the tobacco .add the tube .as simple as a quick slide .a little pinch to clean it up , and now we have our own filtered cigarette .many people enjoy a filtered cigarette over an unfiltered cigarette .filtered cigarettes tend to be a little less drastic of a smoke on your lungs , and they feel a little more at ease with smoking it .quite a few people do n't like , do n't care for spitting out the little bits of tobacco from an unfiltered cigarette .that is another complaint .i myself , enjoy a good filtered cigarette , but i also enjoy not spending my life savings on smoking a cigarette .
here we have one of our hookah pipes here at the hookah bar .by first glance you might look at this an think we 're doing something illegal over here .but no , this is a hookah .it 's been smoked in the middle east for about two thousand years now .they started out being made of wood and slowly it 's evolved in to what you see today .in the beginning they used it for hashish which is marijuana , and then it slowly went over to ,i think they used opium at one point .but then about two hundred years ago , they smoothed over to what 's called shisha which is this fruit blend .it 's a fruit paste tobacco , which is why hookah 's so socially acceptable today .and that 's what they smoke over there in the middle east as well .all those other things have gone out the window a long time ago .o.k.
all right folks , in this clip i 'm going to teach you how to draw an angel .just your basic angel , so we 'll start right here with his head .now , of course , he can be..just as easily a she as a he , although i do not even think that angels necessarily have a sex , per se .they 're just kind of generically known as being angels .but , we wo n't worry too much about that .so first we 'll start with his head , and i 'm just going to kind of draw a generic angel head here .come up here and draw the eyebrows .we have the face already .no need to go into a lot of detail .we wo n't ....the.
let 's talk about raising newborn puppies .there are two kinds of version of this situation .one is if you have a newborn puppy and a functional mother .but very often unfortunately there may be a newborn puppy that does n't have a mother .and so when you have a newborn with a mother , the mom generally is going to take over and raise that puppy as far as , you know , feeding it milk and that sort of thing .but most of the time what we 're facing and talking about here is when you have an orphan .and so when these guys are very small and of course just starting out in life , they 're very fragile .they need to be kept warm .they need to be kept stimulated from time to time also .and then they 're feed milk .you can get puppy milk replacer from your veterinarian and sometimes from pet stores with little feeding bottles .and so it will tell on those type ...
all right , now let 's talk about the recording rate .when you record any song , you want to record at forty-eight k twenty-four bit , that 's the minimum .now there 's high qualities , you have ninety-six k ,i mean , this goes up , all the way up .but the best thing you want to do is forty-eight k.
ah , so the penalties in fencing are organized into three tiers .you can get a yellow card , a red card , or a black card .so the most lenient penalty you can get , is really more of a warning , and that 's a yellow card .you get a yellow card for stepping off of the piste after scoring a touch as you make a fliche .you can get a yellow card for body contact in foil , no body contact is allowed in foil .you can also get one for removing equipment , so there are various other items that can be accidental , which is why the yellow card is fairly lenient .however , two yellow cards for the same offense , will get you a red card .there 's also a number of other offenses that 'll create , that will get you a red card , and that 's usually avoiding inspection , blatantly avoiding inspection , falsifying your inspection marks in some way , because all of your equipment before a formal electric bout has to be inspected to make sure that it 's all up to regulation .a red card is bad , and worse than a yellow card , not just because it 's red , but because a red card means a touch is scored against you , so your opponent gets an extra point .black cards are really , really bad .black cards will get you expelled from the venue , from the tournament , they can get you expelled from the tournament for future tournaments .a black card erases everything that you have done in that tournament so that it actually has a lot of repercussions on how other fencers who have fenced you are then ranked .the good news is , it 's really hard to get a black card accidentally .you get a black card through being caught using drugs , you get a black card through cheating , through refusing to salute , or otherwise being blatantly disrespectful , can actually also get you sent home with a black card .but most fencers are more concerned about offenses in the yellow and in the red , that they might inadvertently receive during a bout .
make sure you choose the right router for what your needs are .if you need a lot of bandwidth and distance or if you just need something small , that will all affect the different price of what you are going to be paying and overall what you want to do with the system .if you are going from place to place , make sure you have a wireless card for your laptop , if you need to connect it different places , such as restaurants or even hotels .if you have a firewall that you know how to control and if you do n't know how to do that stuff , never be afraid to call in an expert and have them come in and set up your wireless network or even set up your firewalls or wep keys .
one aspect of this sort of , traditional , darkroom work so to speak is time .doing this work technically , i do not really think it is that difficult .it is hard , but it is not rocket science .but , the problem for a lot of people , especially if you work , have kids , is the time .you would be surprised how much time you can spend in here and just essentially lose yourself .which is one of the best parts about doing all this stuff .but , to get the amount of time you need to set up , to print , and to do it correctly , i can not stress how important this is .if you are doing all of this stuff that i am talking about today in a rush , it is almost not worth it .so , you always have to look at your schedule .and , i have learned from experience about this .that i know that i have to manage my blocks of time in the darkroom very carefully because , if i do , i usually come in here for a few hours and i make great stuff .but , if i come in here in a rush and i am trying to go someplace to get to point a to point b.
next thing we are going to talk about.
, really makes a nice base .so 1/2 cup of that , 2 teaspoons of corn starch , throw that in .it helps thickened the sauce just a little bit , 2 teaspoons of low sodium dark soy sauce , 2 teaspoons of canola oil and 2 teaspoons of dark toasted sesame oil , and a 1/4 teaspoon crushed pepper flakes , you can add more or less depending.
now let 's go on to line twenty-five .and it continues with those same triplets and slurs , ok.so it 's the same pattern as before .ok , so now let 's take a look at my hand .fourth finger for ' c ' sharp with third right there .move it up .flagellate , remember , shift up .ok.then we 've got .then double stops ok.that is our twenty-fifth line of this boriat piece .
a common question with a lot of bikes is how you would shift it and which gear is correct.
now where i colored , i say we 're going to have some very limited applications of some violet color ; some violet pigment , now  s the time .i 'm looking for some of these regions here where it 's goes from kind of some of this lighter oranges and pinks into this deeper blue and some of these areas.
now just to show you a regular pop we 're going to have rafaela demonstrate .so when you 're popping you 're contracting both your biceps and your triceps , what you want to do is focus on the release of that , so pretend like you 're flexing for somebody , and then you release that , and that 's what creates the pop .now for a dime stop which is another style of popping , it 's when your whole body is contracted and you want to create a picture , so right now rafaela wants to create this picture , so her body is tense for the entire time and what she 's doing is at the very end of that contraction.
you want to be aware of signs like thisthese are repeat signs and that tells you that there is going to be a section of a piece that  s going to be repeated .now if you start at the beginning of the piece here is the first repeat sign , you don  t worry about it.
okay now for a final touch up , i use the same sealant because it is an excellent exterior ceiling just to finish off the edge to make it look like its been there.

this time , the burmese dance , we will talk about the hands .it 's very important , the first thing when i tell you about your basic form and also burmese has the basic form for the hands too .when you look carefully , that look like bot cake , so anytime you 're dancing the hand.
after you get passed doing just plain exercises , you 're going to do one more .it 's halfway in between exercise and an actual drawing because what we 're going to do , is we 're going to do not a blind contour but a contour drawing .we 're just going to draw all the lines that we see on the bear here .we 're not going to try to focus on any of the shadows .we just want to get all the shapes and all the proportions.
hi !this is chef rainer wickel here today on behalf of expervillage.com .well we 've gone over all the utensils and ingredients we need to make this dish and now it is time to get started .the very first thing that we need to do is we need to melt the butter because the butter is actually what is going to be making up the base of our sauce .now it is extremely important that you get unsalted butter .now , you do n't want salted butter because we do n't want that salty flavor in the dish.
we are still talking about scrapbooking and the different options that you have when it comes to time and money to invest in these scrapbooks .on the front cover here i just used stickers , there actually blue stickers , and i just stuck them unto the cover of the scrapbook .with black puff paint went over each letter so that way it has a little more texture and depth to it .but , at the same time if was n't a freehand writing.
so in those 27 different emotional reactions that we have every hour some of them are going to be on that spectrum of anger .and once we recognize the body symptoms again the gnawing of the teeth , the clenching of the hands , one of the most important things that we can do is called changing our state .and it is a very very simple thing to do actually .there is a couple of key things to remember .one is that when the emotions are coming up and we do n't want to feel them regardless of which emotion.
alright , first try , i do n't even need my three other darts .hi , i 'm stephanie with partylandutah.com.
it 's a way of assigning numbers to the notes on those scales .for the rest of the series , we 're going to base what we 're learning off of the c major scale .as i explained earlier , it 's one of the easiest scales to use because there are n't any accidental notes , it 's all natural notes .we do n't have any sharps or flats in here .so , it 's pretty simple .we 've got our seven different notes , eight at the end there .all assigning a scale degree to these notes means is that we -- instead of just referring to them as the note names themselves , c , d , e , f , g , a , b , c , we give them numbers , and we just do it in a consecutive order ,so we call them 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7.

one of the other things that we want to go to is some more energy that we can use quickly .you 've probably seen this in gels that have come on the market and there 's many fine gels , but we also have them incorporated into things like jelly beans now from jelly belly , very tasty , but also work very well .remember , the key thing here to get that quick energy boost is find something that you enjoy eating and like the taste of .in that way , you 'll actually use it .remember , that these are very good but mostly short term energy boosts but work really well .so , experiment around with a few different companies and try a few different flavors of things .lastly , remember that once you 're done with your ride , one of the important things and almost important thing is to be able to recover so that you feel good the next day , then you can go do that ride again .there are many products on the market that we 're going to help you repair that muscle tissue and help you recover better .hammer 's one of the companies out there that makes a very fine product to do this process .you can buy these in individual packs or larger containers .mix this with some water , taste a lot like a milkshake .it tastes good , works good for you , and best of all , you feel so much better in the morning .

two cases of fist cuffs in the o.r .first in belgrade , yugoslavia .a man was on the operating table for an emergency appendectomy .his surgeon was about to cut into him , when another doctor entered .apparently an enemy of his surgeon .and that guy hit the guy in the ear .actually punched him in the nose .said something insulting and walked out .well his surgeon was not going to accept that , he went after the other surgeon .they got into a fight , some teeth were lost and a hand fractured .what about the patient ?well the assistant surgeon actually completed the appendectomy .now let 's go to tokyo and the shiga general hospital .a patient was on the surgery table and suddenly he got cold feet .he said he did n't want to have the operation , which was an intestinal operation .the surgeon was so insulted , do you know what he did ?he punched the patient , punched him in the forehead and he started to bleed .so the operation was canceled .surprisingly , the patient three weeks later , actually opted to have the operation , but with another doctor .now you know what i say to him ?if your surgeon punches you , do n't take it lying down .i do n't care about the scalpel .he hit 's you , you punch him back !yes !you punch him back !
all right we are back.
hi , this is jon , and in the clip i 'll be talking about tool storage .now once you 've accumulated a number of tools , it 's always good to build some type of a storage unit to house all of your tools.
no fat that mom always sent you to the store for .what gives meat a flavor and what gives meat a good texture is going to be a little bit of fat .and particularly a ribeye is going to have a little more than normal .but then also the marbling that 's inside.
so mainly there is this kind of staff rattan .it is also known as a double headed staff .it is called double headed because it is of equal thickness throughout the staff on each end .it is a very flexible type of wood and it is very strong .it will last a very long time .double headed also means that you do one move with one end and then immediately you will do another move with the other end of the stick .so this way .the move will go side to side , up and down with varying techniques .so this is a very pliable type of wood .it has to be the same width from the top all the way to the bottom and the size of the staff.
the first thing you want to do is a tire pressure check .and i 've got my handy pressure gauge , i may not do this every single time i run the tractor .but once a week at least .every time you want to walk around and give them a kick and check , but at least once a week you want to give them a quick check .now the pressure will vary depending upon the size of the tires on your tractor .in this particular case we only want to run about fifteen psi in it , it just barely registers on this gauge .it 's typical that you run a much lower pressure on tractor tires than you do on car tires .the reason this is important is because you can get in a situation on a tractor , where you have an implement in the air , and we 're about thirty psi on this front tire .and that 's exactly what i want to see on this size of tire .i was saying that 's important , because any thing that alters the balance of the tractor can be a potential safety problem .you get an implement up in the air , one tire is much lower than it normally is , you 're on a slope , and that can create the chance of an overturn .
today 's topic is how to change a hubcap .there are many different varieties of hubcap .one of them is this small type which has four screws in it .you unscrew the screws , pull the hubcap off .there are two basic types of hubcap , some that screw off and others that pop off , like this one .you pop the hubcap off and you put it back on the same way , hook it on.

once you picked your frame then you need to pick a matte board that is going to become comfortable with the pieces of what your framing is .as well as comfortable with the room that you are going to be putting it in , this particular customer has a lot of blue in her room .so i choose two different color blue to show her just to show her if she had a clue .i personally like the more subdue blue than the brighter blue.
next , i 'm going to select the roses .there 's many different varieties of roses , there 's spray roses , there 's , these are a large variety of a tea rose .they 're a very large variety , but they 're pretty .and there 's also long stemmed roses , there 's many different varieties , colors , etc .now we 're going to want to choose a rose that 's going to last a long time .on this particular design , i 'm going to use the pink roses , because first of all they have a nice height and we want our roses to be one and a half to two times the height of the container .one is fine actually .so , we 're going to use these .they 're nice and big roses too .now to select a really good rose , all you need to do is , squeeze it .and by squeezing it , you want it to feel very firm .because that means it 's got a lot of life left in it .it will open up quite a bit more .so , if you find a rose that is like this , it 's very pretty , but it 's not going to last very long , because when you squeeze it , you can almost , you can pinch it really tight .so that 's how you can select a rose that is going to last for quite a long time .
first and foremost , you 're going to have to get phyllo dough .it 's a specialty item .like i said , we 're fortunate enough to have the euro mart right across the street which i 'm definitely going to do a video soon , and i got their permission.

i am going to demonstrate the staff pose .i love the staff pose because , although it 's simple , it 's great for strengthening the legs .it pulls the abdominals in and creates a nice tall straight back .first , i want you to align your shoulders with your hips .you are going to draw your navel in towards your spine .as you inhale , you are going to place the palms of your hands down on the floor .now , i have long arms , a lot of people can place their hands right by their hips without flexing their arms .since my elbows bend slightly , i ?ll straighten my arms by moving them slightly in front of my hips .next , i 'll pull my toes towards me .this creates tightens muscles through my legs and strengthens as i press my hamstring muscles down into the floor .this pose is great for strengthening the muscles of the legs .then , i 'll look forward .i create a long straight neck .i just gaze out in front and take a deep breath .i open my ribs.
this is a dribbling while walking drill .it seems like a really simple drill but you notice as you get started it is a little more difficult than it appears .this is great for using hand/eye coordination and for just getting your hands strong and using good ball handling techniques .i am going to show this in slow motion.
now we have our wings like this and they are unfold it like you want them .what we are going to do is we are going to make sure we are going to take.
as i said before , time is money , which is true of any business anywhere .when you 're a freelancer or a subcontractor , obviously because you 're not clocking in and clocking out of an office , there 's really no way of gauging how much time you 're working on a project if you were n't writing it down or keeping detailed records .a lot of times , a client will ask you at the outset , `` how much is this going to cost me for , say , a three-minute video ? ''well , you need to take a very long look at past projects , things you 've done for other clients , so you can give them a reasonable expectation as to how long it 's going to take .it 's very important not to undersell the amount of time it 's going to take on a project because then you might end up cutting your rate in half .when you price a project out , you want to make sure that if you say you 're going to have to spend one hour on this piece of graphic or this piece of video that you 're not spending two hours on it because that means you 're getting half the money .this kind of a trap is very easy to fall into , especially for beginners , and you can learn a lot of expensive lessons along the way .my advice would be to make sure that once you 've agreed to a price on a project , you do the work that is expected of you ,you deliver what you can , but you do n't overextend yourself when it comes to time , when it comes to effort and energy because if that same client asks you to do another project , they 're going to expect the same amount of work at the same price ; and if you put in double the time that you originally promised , you 're going to have to do double the time again for the same price .so just make sure that you 're safeguarding yourself against excess deadlines , excess client expectation so that in the end , it 's a mutually equitable partnership for everyone involved .
today , we 're going to discuss hiking boots , backpacking boots , and rock climbing shoes .the best thing for hiking or backpacking , would be a boot that comes above your ankle , for support .i like oslos .it 's a great boot , lasts a long time , waterproof .depending on the situation that you 're in , or the place that you 're hiking , you would want to do some research , to figure out what the best boot would be , for your situation , whether it 's warmth , comfort , support , or waterproof .when it comes to a rock climbing shoe , there 's a variety of different types .in our gym , we like to use velcro slippers , because they 're easy on , easy off .outdoors , for more technical climbing , you might use a lace up , that tightens up the toe box .anytime that i hike into the woods , i 'm wearing an approach shoe .my approach shoe has climbing rubber , just like a rock climbing shoe , a solid toe box , but it 's ' more like a boot , or a shoe for hiking .this has been our segment on shoes for hiking , backpacking and climbing .again , my name is scott , in wilmington , north carolina .

all right , folks , in this clip i 'm going to teach you how to draw an ecstatic expression on a cartoon character , just really overjoyed , happy face .i 'm going to do it right up here in this corner .so , let 's move up there .ok , and the key to this one will definitely be , as well , in the eyes .we 're going to make them extra big .and one way to make the eyes look all ecstatic is , traditionally , you would draw some sort of eyebrow or an eyelid definition , but we 're not going to do that .that really helps sell the ecstatic expression .make the mouth as high up as it possibly can be .nice and big .and then draw his tongue .now , that really helps sell the happy expression .another way you can do it , just to really make sure they know this guy is ecstatic about something , is make his eyebrows really high up .normally , they 'd be somewhere in this area .we 're raising them just a bit there , just to make them really sell the fact that this guy 's insanely happy .then you come right around here , just kind of build around , a giant open mouth .just like that .come in here and draw the ears and up to the hair .the eyebrows , in this case , will actually overlap the hair just a little bit .that 's ok.it 's kind of a good way to show just how happy he is .and you can call a lot of attention to the eyebrows if you want .looks a little silly , i know , but it 's just a good , solid way to show that the character 's really happy .raise his eyebrows up .make his eyes wide and full .mouth open like that .make sure the tongue is clearly defined in there .and there you have it .this would be definitely the ecstatic look .all right .and there you have it .

the third you 've got to know you about skipping stones is choosing the right location .choosing the right location for skipping stones is one of the most important steps .make sure that the body of water you choose is calm .this means that there should n't be any waves .also thumb make sure that there are n't any objects , people , or other obstructions in the stones path , because this would impede the stone from skipping .obviously , this the wrong place for skipping stones .why ?because it is too shallow and it does not have enough space for skipping the stones .hi !this carmen conde for expert village , and thank you for skipping stones with me .
so the most important aspect of even playing , before you start playing , is you want to kind of loosen your bow a bit .and at the very end , when you 're done playing , you 're going to completely loosen it before you put your bow away .but when you first take your bow out and your tightening your hair , you do n't want to tighten it too much .you actually want it to be slightly loose .you should be able to touch the stick against the hair , like that .you want it to be slightly loose , you do n't want your hair to be too taught , because when you try and play you 're going to feel it in your arms .so you kind of want to practice loosening it .then , at the end when you 're completely done playing , you 're going to loosen it all the way because you want the hair to kind of fall gently .but , again , you do n't want to loosen your hair too much because if you start loosening it you 're actually going to start taking your bow apart .when you , typically , get your hair changed what they do is they loosen your hair completely.
and i 'm here to answer the question how do you find out about the penalties for shoplifting .well , shoplifting is the act of stealing merchandise from a retail store or other type of shop .what constitutes shoplifting and what the penalties are is going to vary from state to state and sometimes from municipality to municipality .so , you 're going to want to check your particular states.

today i 'm going to show you how to change a flat tire .there 's only about one tool that you need to change a flat tire .and that 's just a tire lever .yeah ,you need at least one , up to about three .depending on how tight the tire is .usually you can get away with using just one .the first thing is , you want to start opposite the valve stem .insert the tire lever under one half of the tire bead .and you should then be able to just slowly pry it off .kind of unzip it all the way around , ending back opposite the valve stem .at that point , you should be able to reach inside that tire and remove the flat inner tube .and then you can grab a new inner tube , or either try to patch the flat one .but the next step to reinstalling it is going to be to inflate the tube with air , just to give it some shape .and then you 'll start opposite as in removal .and insert the stem into the hole in the rim .and then tuck that tire , or the inner tube up into the tire all the way around .and then starting at the valve , begin to reinstall the other half of the tire bead .being careful not to pinch the inner tube in between the tire and the rim as you work the bead back on .and you want to end up opposite that valve stem , so that you have the most slack in the tire to allow you to pop the last little bit back on .the trick is not to use any tools when you pry this last bit back on .otherwise you 're running a high risk of pinching the inner tube .you should be able to do it , just by working it on slowly .and there you have it .you can then just inflate it to , you know , recommended inflation pressure .which should be marked on the outside of pretty much all tires .that 's how you change a flat tire .
as he goes into strike , he has to make sure that he punches me in the stomach .one of my worst pet peeves is when people punch out here .i do n't care if he punches out here .i do n't care if he punches out here , if he does that all day long , all he 's doing is fanning me .it 's making me cool off .so he has to punch like he 's going to make me see my lunch .as he does that , i do my tenkan motion that we talked about in the very beginning , this turning motion .so as he strikes , i tenkan , control this wrist , and bring him back around .principle of dynamic reversal .it 's a bad spot to turn someone right around into this , because you 're giving him momentum to strike you with .if you watch his other hand , boom , he could really clean your clock from here .so you have to maintain control of this wrist from the very beginning .one , two .from here , kotegaeishi , like i talked before , is not a wrist lock out to the side , like this .a lot of styles like aikido you 'll see a big huge wrist lock , which gives it a really pretty fall , it looks very impressive on camera .but in reality , it gives him a lot of opportunity to punch , or to just knock my hands off , and put me in kotegaeishi myself .so instead we keep our kotegaeishis very small , and you 'll see from the next one i control the entire body with this .you 'll also see , i moved right into the pin that i discussed before .extending the shoulder into the ground , maintaining control , i 've got my entire workspace laid out before me .i used to do this technique to pin to the outside , but if he starts to move away , it 's too easy for me to lose that .so from here , i 've got him pinned here , and if he starts to get away , i can transition into a strike , to a head grab , to a knee drop , anything that i need is right here at my feet .control the arm , step away .

when you play this game , you '' ll find that you can win it regularly enough .so i 'm going to submit that there can be a special rule to make things more difficult .regularly when we play baroness we have five cards up , and it 's five columns or stacks .and let 's say that i am in the middle of a play and i have this situation .i 'm stacking this a little bit .in this situation i can move this eight to this five , that 's thirteen , and move those two cards of to the foundation , off the tableau to the foundation .now with regular rules you 're allowed to fill these gaps .if you fill these gaps it makes it easier because you have more cards to choose from when you 're trying to make thirteen .to make things harder you can have a rule that you can not fill these gaps with cards from the tableau .you have , with a special rule you have to play like this .so you 're saying , blank spots , if you will , can only be filled with cards from the stockpile and not the tableau .if you play it that way it makes it more difficult .

now , in this clip i 'm going to talk to you about a particular procedure called a testicular biopsy .now , when we perform a testicular biopsy is when a patient comes in and they might have several signs and symptoms of a possible suspicion of having testicular cancer .so the first thing we do is to order a testicular biopsy .now you think , `` what is this procedure ? ''well , here is a diagram .first of all , what is the definition of testicular biopsy ?well , basically it 's a simple , surgical procedure to remove a piece of tissue from the testicle .here you could see a diagram-picture of the testicle , and here 's a diagram of the testicle .here 's the testicle , the penis gland , and the testicle sitting in the scrotal sac .and here is a picture of the incisional sight .so for example , here is one of the testicles .if we suspect that the testicular cancer , or the tumorous mass , is within this testicle , we then do the incisional cut along this sight here .so , what is the procedure ?well , basically what we do is make an incision in the skin of the scrotum , and then we use a fine needle , or we use we use a very fine pair of scissors , and we actually snip out a small portion of the mass from the testicle itself .we then examine this mass tissue , little piece of tissue from the testicle , under a microscope to determine whether we see any cancerous cell growth at all .this simple procedure , called the testicular biopsy , which should could be done very simply either in the doctor 's office or in the clinic in the hospital .
hello , mark bowers from bowers photography , bowersphotography.com .i 'm in utah .we 're here to talk about difference , or digital photography and the difference between digital photography and film .the biggest difference is more precise and.
today 's topic is how to choose the right tire , for winter driving .most cars come with a tire , that look like this .they have just a nice tread on them , and not very much aggressiveness .this tire has a little more aggressive tread on it .it 's better for winter driving , and there are tires with more aggressive tread than this .the way to choose the proper one , is to figure out where you are driving from .do you drive in town only ?are the streets plowed very well ?do you have a lot of snow ?if you 're in a place where there 's a lot of snow , you 'll want a very aggressive tire .maybe even one that has the holes in it , where they put studs in the tire , for ice .if you do n't do much highway driving , or areas where there 's not so much snow , an all terrain tire is probably the best .if you 're in an area where there 's a lot of snow , you might want to put the very aggressive tire on , which are more aggressive , and more aggressive , and this one is n't that very aggressive , but it 's a different type of tread .your dealers , most people who sell tires , can find out the proper tire for your car , according to your driving conditions .ask questions .do n't be ever afraid to ask a question of how you drive , and let them know how you drive and where you drive .this will give you the proper way to get the right tire , for your car .

you want it to cook .you see how it 's kind of boiling ?i want you to let it boil for just a little bit .it 's going to pop up and boil .it 's important before you place your meat in here for it to do that , for it to go ahead and boil like that .there 's a couple of other ingredients that we 're going to go ahead and throw in there , but it 's after you put the picadillo , which is the ground beef and the pork .first , i 'm going to just stir this and let it boil again .before i place my other ingredients , i 'm going to get my meat.
hi , i want some ice cream , i want sweet cream with oreo 's .we crush the spoon in , make it all delicious .you 're going to catch it.
ladies , that is really a tricky area for you.
this is another reason i did n't use the hard wood.
so i 'm continuing to work on the legs and to be using my forearm and elbow here .i am working on the outside of the leg here .it is a much stronger tool in many ways .i am kind of just kneading the tissue on the side of the leg .as you can see i leave my hand here as a base , the mothering hand .as you can see sara 's feet are just naturally turned in pigeon toed .that is the exact way you should be with her hands to her side .you can take your time with this , it 's nothing to hurry .in fact a lot of times the clients will say i wish you would have spent more time in that one area .after a while as a therapist here you realize those areas that need more work and almost every recipient will gladly take more time in certain areas that is needed .so as i am finishing up here for this section of the massage i want to kind of spread the energy and keep my energy in my palms and tossing any way chi that is not needed and also it is assuring the partner that at least for now it is coming to a close.
through all of our other segments we 've talked about the physical aspects of hitting the ball .we 've talked about your stance , stepping in the box , we 've talked about your hands , we 've talked about your head , talked about you know , where you need to be looking .we 've talked about actually getting your swing started .what we 're going to talk about now is the actual mental game ; thinking about baseball , thinking about hitting ; things like that .now , what we 're going to talk abut first is knowing your strike zone .very , very important , because you need to know your limitations ; what you can hit , what you can handle .again , strike zone ; just play your chest to roughly about your knees .again , you know , it varies whether you 're in little league , high school , college , you know , whatever , but that 's essentially the basic zone .now from this zone here , you also have a zone that goes this way , which is from this part to the plate to this part of the plate , seventeen inches .that 's essentially your zone .and again , because you have an umpire it 's subjective .he may give you a little bit more room from the inside , a little bit more room on the outside .it is , it 's going to vary from umpire to umpire .why do you want to know these things , why do you want to know , okay.
i mentioned that i 'm working on a glass palate here .the glass is placed into the box of my portable easel .this kind of easel is great for planer painting , as we mentioned .it 's also great for working on a small scale .working larger , i like a larger palate .i personally like a lot of room .but working on a small scale this works .also , with the glass i can clean it really easily in the middle of a painting process .disposable palates are great too .they come in sizes that will insert right into there .this is and ecl easel , one of a number of brands that combine the easel with the palate.
hi i 'm brie .now we 're going to learn part two of salsa .now in part two we 're going to add a stylish move called the tap .it 's really important.
the first move , traveling move , i 'm going to show you is just simply walking with a move .what you want to do is just simply walk , just nice and gracefully , nice and slow , or you can put a little bit more pep in your step , if you want to .and we 're just going to add to moves to it .so , when we walk , we can add just a little shoulder shimmy.
okay so now we have opened the vessel here the form and we 're ready to start raising the walls of this salad bowl .and we want a lot of water on our hands so that the clay does n't grab .you do n't want the clay to grab your hands , however you do n't want to get the clay overly wet because then it will get all soggy on you.
cutting it open it makes a nice little pocket and we 're going to spread the chumous in the techina .i put the chumous on the outside and the techina in the middle we take them and spread them on both sides of the pocket .the little pita pocket then we put the eggplants one eggplant , the falafel balls i made the falafel balls big.
for the feet you 're going to need 2 items .first off , you 're going to need some black socks , some good old basic black socks .that 's going to get it done for you .you can get these black socks in most convenient stores .our overall costume is going to be black .we 're going to be a black cat on halloween , so definitely get yourself some black socks .you may own some already .they 're certainly much more common than they used to be .as long as they 're not the really formal socks , which tend to fall down off your ankles within the first 5 seconds of putting them on .it 's going to great .you 're going to want some socks that are going to be staying up , so you do n't want the socks that end right on your ankle either .definitely up to your mid calf , because what we 're going to do is we 're covering up any flesh colored parts of our body so that we do n't have to put makeup over everything .in addition , shoes .any type of general black shoes will do .if you expect to be in a lot of slippery surfaces , i do n't recommend having a really flat bottom .slick bottom shoes are going to be slipping all night long .you can also of course the more industrial type of shoes like the tougher type of shoes .keep in mind , if you 're going for more of cat like look looking like a feline .felines are little more petite , a little more graceful , a little quite less clunky so to speak .definitely keep that in mind with your shoe choice .
hi , this is david for expert village and today we are going to make a stuffed mirliton pirogue .
m going to show you how to make cute little bag out of regular everyday fabrics .so the next step that we 're going to do is we 're going to sew our lining onto our bag .this can be a little tricky if you have a small bag like this because it 's very hard to position it under the sewing machine .what you want to do is you want to start sewing right on the outer , right where your seam is because that 's where you 're going to go back and forth .that 's where you 're going to start your stitch .and that 's where you 're going to go back and forth .and again , you want to make sure that you do have , because since now this stitch is going to go over the top of the outside of the bag , this again shows the importance of picking a thread that 's going to disappear in your fabric .the last thing you want is a colored thread line up at the top .pulling out pins as you go and holding your fabric straight .and this is probably the hardest part of the whole project , is keeping this hemline straight .ok .
now , the whole introduction to this song starts with bass .that 's the key signature or that 's the signature riff for the song that everybody recognize , but it 's for the bass guitar .when the actual guitar kicks in , we use an octave technique in which we use our index finger on the 12th fret , skipping this one or muting it out with our index finger.
it 's dow here at the firehouse car wash.today we 're teaching how to detail your boat like a professional .it 's this segment what i want to cover is cleaning the carpets and the floors .of course , just like anything we 're going to want to start with is vacuuming the carpets .and i like ,really , there 's two tools that i like to do that .one is the claw , which goes and gets broad areas like that .the other is your crevice tool which you can swap out on the vacuum .and a good shop vac.
okay we are almost to our seam now.
now we 're going to begin with skin care .this is the most important step other than removal at the end of the night .you need to take care of your skin .your makeup is only going to look as good as the skin underneath it .you want to make sure that you cleanse your face completely before you start your makeup .do n't do your makeup over your old makeup from the night before .just do n't do it .cleanse your skin completely .make sure all the makeup residue is off .once your skin is completely cleansed , then immediately apply your moisturizer .depending on your skin type , you can use an oil-free moisturizer .a moisturizer with an spf is good for daytime .she has a little drier of a skin type , so i 'm going to use a bit of a more moisturizing moisturizer just to give a little more hydration .apply it all over the face and even down the neck .do n't forget the neck .the neck is a very important part .around the eyes .you do n't want to put a ton on , but definitely make sure that you spread it evenly and that all parts of your face have moisturizer on it .it 'll just make your makeup go on a lot nicer too .then i 'm going to use a little bit of an eye cream as well , which i think is very important .just around the eye area .put a tiny bit of eye cream before you start your makeup .anything you put around your eyes will go on so much smoother and your eyes is where you see your age most often ,so you want to make sure that your eyes look fresh , young , and healthy .lastly , you want to put on a lip conditioner , especially if you 're using a lot of lip colors and especially in the winter .you want to make sure that your lips are very , very hydrated .rub your lips together .now we 're ready to start with foundation .
ok , now were going to talk about watering your compost pile .now here i have a nice barrel of water .and its spring water.
the next four exercises i am going to show you are going to be down on the floor if you at the beach , you going to need a towel , if you are at home you can for this on the carpet .first exercise i am going to show you is for your blue muscles , it 's an exercise that is going to target those blues and it 's called the quardrop hit extension , you are going to get down on your hands and knees.
but , there are things that need to be considered when you decide to bunk down for the night .there are a lot of dangers that exist in the wilderness that can effect where you camp .for instance , the area that we 're standing in right now , if you look behind me , we have this wall of rock .and , one would have to be concerned that any loose rock could fall down if you were camped below , and injure or kill you .we have a ravine here that actually goes down into a slot canyon and runs out into a creek below .if you had a rainstorm , and a rainstorm does n't have to be right here , it could be four miles away , and the water could come down this ravine and a flash flood setting could be eight , ten feet deep , running fifty , sixty miles an hour .you 'd never escape it .you 'd never be able to get up the walls of this rock formation quickly enough .other things that you need to think about.
now we 're ready to do the temper part .ok.so , we 're going to hit it with straight phthalo green .and actually this is going to work better if we do wet and wet .so , cleaning out this brush.
because they look a lot like a bank shot and they are actually lined up the same as you line up a bank shot .but , for serious pool players , they like to make a distinguishing difference between the two of them .in that a kick shot , to a pool player , means that your driving the cue ball to a cushion before it approaches an object ball , with a set up like this .so , if i drive this cue ball into that cushion , as such , to come over the hit that ball , then i 'm said to be kicking at it rather than banking it .so , it 's just a difference in the terminology .but , again , with serious players , if one of them is telling the other one , `` you need to play the kick shot here .
the next step in our living room project is to re-assemble the ceiling we 've been working on .as you can see the tiles are dry .normally , i would recommend a second coat , and that goes for the lattice work as well and also for the wall , and the trim , but for the purposes of this demonstration we are just going to stick to one coat .so , let 's put these panels back up .again , be very careful because these things do crumble .it should just snap into place like that .ok , we are almost finished our how to paint a living room project .next i am going to show you how to clean up .
just sort of fan the pears out like a flower .french people seem to have a lot of fun with their food , that 's for sure .ok.
there are a couple of basic criteria that you should think about following whenever you are preparing your festival .the event should be in a location that is customer use .in other words , a place where people are used to going and do n't have to think about it too much .it can be a park , a street that is closed , it can be an indoor facility , somewhere that folks can get to and some place folks can get to easily .so think in terms of where buses run , where the parking is or is n't , way people can get there without people having to make a big effort .remember whenever you do your festival , other things are going to be going on at the same time.
so far i 've showed you how to quantize after you record data .usually if you 're recording certain piano parts and things like that you may want to keep like a realistic feel , so you might not want to quantize , but sometimes with drums and things like that it 's almost always necessary to quantize .especially if you are using electronic drums and you 're doing more of a style of music that requires more straight on timing .so , what i 'm going to show you now is the input quantize .the input quantize basically lets you quantize on the way in .so when you 're actually recording it , it 's actually going to record it fixed .it 's going to fix the time automatically for you .what you 're going to do is you 're going to go to midi and go to input quantize .once you 've gone to input.
the next really good point for the lower leg , especially in the knees is called dispersing point , or stomach 41.and that one is going to be right at the top of the hock .and this one is pretty easy to find , there 's usually not a lot of muscle in this area .and again , your finger you go down below the joint and your finger just sort of falls into that hole .it 's a very good point for the lower legs in general .it 's particularly good for arthritis , it 's a good spot to use the straight up and down hold .you can use thumb pressure , you can also do a circular motion , but it is a good one to use that steady hold on .and it 's one that will work really well for any kind of pain and stiffness especially in the back legs .so it 's one you can use in various points .again usually with knees the problem will be one sided , but it never hurts to do both sides if your dog is relaxed and comfortable.
i really want to take one bag .what we need to do is find a way to fit all of our supplies that we 're going to need in the bag .the biggest thing we need is our paper .one way to do that is to buy a binder like this one .some scrapbook bag will come with it .it has some dividers already and your papers just slide in between those dividers so that you can organize your paper by theme or by color .this divider is perfect for an 12x12 paper , and then you could also put your 8 1/2x11 in this binder .i like to keep my 8 1/2x11 paper separate , so i have a separate container .again , it 's got all of the dividers and i have my paper organized by color in the front .i had extra pockets , so i organized by theme in the bag .your stickers and other things fit in here as well .along with the binders , you can buy these plastic containers .they 're in search for the binders and they store die cuts , stickers , and all kinds of different paper embellishments that you 're going to need to scrapbook with .this is a great compact way to carry all of your scrapbooking supplies .
it 's very light weight .it uses wires and the king posts to give it.

so now i 'm going to show you a bunch of different ways to make handles for your batter bowl .anytime that your making something that requires an handle you can have a lot of fun and get really experimental .one of my favorite handles to make for a batter bowl is a braided handle and the way that i do that.
the first thing we want to do is to steep the tea in the pot .we are going to use one tea scoop.
alrighty , then .we 've got our handle attached .and , we 're back outside and back to the angle grinder .now , i 've put another disk on this .this is a finer disk , so it 's going to make a little smoother cut .and , i 'm just going to grind down this a little bit .take some of the bark off .and , just kind of do anything i want .we 'll start the grinder up .and , what i 'm first going to do is just take little bits out .i 'm not going to grind for a long time .because , taking little bits out will gives us more contrast when we grind through the layers of bark .so , here we go with the noise and the dust .that looks pretty good .we 're going to sand it a little bit more .and , that should bring out some more of the wood grain .so , now we 're going to go our palm.
ok , so using the same brush you were just using to do the polka dots on the bandana , get a little bit more black.
so using kinds of rhythmic .and you do n't have to use the pedal to do that either.
now , encaustic painting means melted wax painting.
the next step is to now develop a motion in the head , that 's very easy .so you want to start with the feet apart , drop your shoulders , and rotate your shoulders forward like that and keep your head very , very loose , very loose and try to bounce your shoulders down as the head stays down.
so we 're going to move to the four and the four minor chord .we 're going to use the same shape that we used for the d.

alright in this section i 'm going to show you how to check your brake fluid and possibly bleed if you need to , if you have really low pressure .this is your master cylinder right here .this is where all the fluid gets collected and this is pretty much your whole brakes right here , and this tube runs down , right to this and this pushes it through and that goes down to your calipers that we worked on earlier .so what you want to do is remove this screw , and then this is a screw off top .now brake fluid is really , really bad stuff , so you do n't want to get it on anything , skin , paint , anything .first thing you do when you check a master cylinder.

everybody likes to hit a kill shot , which is a shot that hits just inches off the front wall .but it 's not always the best strategy to go for a kill shot every single time .so you have to incorporate good strategy and hit pass shots , but when do you hit a pass shot ?often times you want to hit a pass shot when the kill shot 's not working .so the perfect shot obviously is really low , kill shots but not everybody , and even the best players in the world ca n't always hit the ball that high , or that low .so sometimes you want to bring it up and use good strategy on pass shots because that can be just as effective .so , if the kill shots not working , switch to a pass shot .you do n't have to hit the ball this high to have it be effective .a nice pass shot , knee or chest high , as long as it stays on this wall or cross court can really throw your opponent off.
well , there 's a similarity there .responsibility is a part of how to avoid jealousy .let me give you an example , and i 'll give you several examples .you and your girlfriend , this is for men , are sitting in a restaurant , and along comes a girl , and you see her.

hi , i 'm amelia and i 'm going to talk to you about how to best lighten blonde hair .since blonde hair is already relatively light , you do n't have to go through a lot of different processes to do it , so.
soccer players all around the world are major fans of other soccer players .just like children are that play the game , and fans , and other spectators are fans as well .a lot of these teams get together for friendly matches that 's not , that turn out not to be so friendly after a few minutes .some of these games turn out to be very physical and very physically demanding .at the end of these games , sometimes you see players from each team exchanging their jerseys .this shows that they have great respect for each other .also , as being these great soccer players are also huge soccer fans , by being fans of other teams and other players around the world they allow themselves to change jerseys .also , these major clubs are very affluent and can also afford to have so many jerseys for each game .before each game , a lot of these clubs get new jerseys , and this is just a way that they show that they have respect for other teams by being able to exchange them .and that is why soccer teams exchange jerseys .

what we 've got to do now , rich , is we 're standing in front of each other , we 'll look at each other , psyching each other out , and what not .and we 're coming down to the table .you 'll put your elbow down , just like that .we 're meeting at the wrists .what 's important now is that these wrists are bent .this helps give you leverage on your opponents power .you want to be able to get a jump start on his mental state which you do by , you can do all the screaming you want , but the real intimidation comes in your forearm when you can actually give him a sense of your power and you are already wrestling before the arm wrestling starts to happen .
so the variations are actually -- for the second half of the chorus , they 're pretty much the same thing .you have the hi-hat lift and the upbeat of three going into four on the snare , and then the next one is hi-hat lift on the upbeat of three , snare on four and then hi-hat lift on the upbeat of four again .okay ,so literally it 's the same thing .it just gets a little trickier because you have those hi-hat lifts in the downbeats of two and four as well .he leaves out the four downbeat lift when he 's doing these tags , okay ?so it 's not -- otherwise , it will get a little messy .this is what the first variation sounds like .okay , so he 's not doing , you know , upbeat of three lift and then downbeat of four lift as well ,okay ?it 's closed on the downbeat of four when he 's doing the snare hit.
let 's talk about the infield fly .another quirky little situation in baseball that rarely happens but when it does is often very misunderstood .what the infield fly rule means is that the ball has been hit into the air within the field of play over the infield .what happens in this situation and the reason this rule is in effect is because the runners who are on base can not advance until a pop fly has been caught by the fielder .if there is a runner on first , a runner on first and second , or a runner on first and third.

when you have your band the next step is to decide the type of music you 're going to play .a lot of the times the music is dependent on the style of the group of people and also their personal tastes and interests .physical style can be related to musical style as well .for example , in blind all records , a group that i 'm a part of the music focus is on hip-hop .you can tell by the imagery that it is more urban style and it has an outline of the musical styles that they 're going to be in .another friend focuses on jazz and blues .you can see by her imagery it is more jazzy and less urban .another group that i have worked with is called nutshell .they have more of an alternative rock sound .this is also shown by the imagery and their style of clothing .
so right now i 've just completed this redo , this cover up ,this eleven year old piece .and as you can see there 's no trauma to the skin .you know , it 's not bleeding , it 's not puffy , it 's not red .you know , that 's the right way to approach it.
okay folks , in this clip we 're going to talk about how to create storyboards .now , for the purpose of this video.
rope stretches for the upper body ?jonesy is going to take a rope here , and he 's going to do some stretches for the upper body .basically we have three variations that we 're going to work through .jonesy is going to go ahead and start the first one , shoulder dislocates .basically all he 's doing is working up and over , using the rope as a good stabilizer for where his hands are , and just working a range of motion of his shoulders forward and backwards , up and over his shoulders .now jonesy 's going to go ahead and give a variation here .okay .he finds a sweet spot .he 's basically finding a spot in his chest and his shoulder , and through his biceps that feels a good stretch , something that you know that it just feels good .once he gets that , then he rotates his trunk around .the rotation of the trunk is actually going to help loosen up his shoulders and his chest .then we 'll go through the third variation here which will be a wrap around the body .he 's taking one arm up and over , wrapping around his body and bringing it back down , and then he 'll bring it forward , back again .do one side , and then the other side .good .those are our rope stretches for the upper body .
now in this last clip , i 've been waiting for this .what we 're going to do is experiment using all of the , all those movements .whether we 're coming up from the five to the one .or coming up from the four to the one .or reversing them , coming down .here 's what we can do it .ok ?here 's what it 'll sound like when you put them all together .remember that variation there .keep coming up .so what i 'm going to do with my foot now.
in this clip we are going to begin the rough exterior shape of the bowl .what we are going to aim for is a nice slope like that , a nice gradual curve .this is what we do n't want is something like this and the reason is when it comes time to hog out the inside , this area right here is going to be real hard to turn because it is at a very acute angle .so let 's get started on that nice gentle slope .
in this example what i 'm going to show you how to do a hybrid picking.
let 's talk about treating a dog with a cold .cold is a very non specific term .and humans , we think of colds as being anything from the flu to just upper respiratory viruses alone , and in essentially it 's the same with a dog .if you 're dealing with a cold , what we have in a dog is going to be generally an upper respiratory infection , a lower respiratory infection , something like that .just feeling kind of bad .a lot of these in dogs are viral and/or bacterial .and so the first thing to do is to identify if your dog is sick.
alright .now , that we 've got the round neckline down , we 're going to do a u-shaped neckline just curving a little bit lower than the round neckline .and , this is what it will look like at it 's beginning point .and , it 's pretty much the same as the round neckline .except , like i said lower .you want to make the neckline low .and , then again here.
now , as i look at this.
ok , the next category of herbs were going to talk about are the astringents .lemon is one of the most astringent things in the world , and witch hazel .do you remember ,i remember when i was young watching the older women put make up on.
hello i 'm stevie moore and welcome to my studio here at the artist 's attic in lexington , kentucky .alright.
the tool menus are basically two little boxes that tell you what kind of functions you can do at that moment .if you look at the top of the arrange window right here , you 're going to see these two little boxes .the pointer and there 's a slicer .now to switch between the two within that box , i just have to hold on the apple key .once i hold on.
so after our bridge pose , we 've warmed up our back a little bit .we 've done locust , we 've done a little cover , we 've done a little bridge .we 're going to work into some more extreme back bending .back bending is an amazing miraculous thing for sending the energy that stagnates in our core , through our limbs , through our body , waking us up through the heart and energizing .so this one is bow , we 're going to lay down on the belly.
we 're going to now discuss how to hit a fairway wood off this downhill , side hill lie .so , the ball is below my feet .now this 3 wood is a long club .so , normally i would be about like this if i was on level ground .so the ball 's another 6 or 8 inches lower.
in this segment i 'm going to talk about the names of the notes .there 's a - the names of the notes are basically an alphabet , and they only go from a to g.
combine the two to pull off this pretty advance trick .start by rolling backwards , pop the ollie as you normally would , bring your front foot to level out and roll away .the major difference between doing a regular front ollie and a fakie ollie is that doing the fakie ollie you have to push your front foot further up and faster to get the momentum of the board in order to level it out and roll away .let 's see one in action .roll backwards pop and land .usually when performing this trick , i like to keep my focal point on the street as i 'm rolling backwards on the nose as i 'm ollieing and back to the street as i land .let 's see it one more time .roll a fakie , pop the ollie , bend the knees and land .with enough speed , learning how to fakie ollie can lead you into learning how to do more advanced fakie flip tricks .
so now we have our design and we are going to cut a piece of glass that will fill it in.
and i 'm going to tell you what to do if your computer freezes up and you need to shut it off .first thing you can do is , if your computer freezes up , try hitting control , alt , delete .it 's kind of like a , you know , the best way to.
in this section i 'm going to talk about dorian mode .the c major scale is actually another word for it is ionian mode.
this next movement is another fairly dynamic motion and movement .we 're going to be focusing on the hips and the pelvic region as well as the quads , the hamstrings and the glutes , so more lower-chain motion and movement .we 're going to go on to a four-point position here .we call this a quad-ped motion .we talked about this earlier , a four-point position , four points of contact .what we 're going to do is we 're going to step up and across the body .we 're looking for a lot of rotation in the hip .again , many people have a lot of restrictions through the hip and the pelvis .this maybe a difficult motion which you may want to start with just coming forward and coming back .we call that kind of a mountain-climber motion .but i like to make it a little more dynamic , bring that foot up to the opposite hand , come back and then switch .try to keep the hands flat on the ground .what you 'll find is one side might move better than the other , but work on getting this power up and as much range of motion or as much movement as you can .this is good for the shoulders , core , hips , pelvis , quads , hamstrings , another great total-body movement .
okay now that we 've basically got the features of the face .we indicated the ears.
what i want to talk to you now about is how to adjust the date and time on your computer system .let me start out by saying that windows xp is a registered trademark of microsoft.
more so you do not need as much foundation .i would recommend a souffle style , a lighter foundation , stay away from the thick cream foundations , because that will kind of weigh your skin down .so in a mature skin i would do a souffle or a liquid or water base , that will be really pretty .on a younger skin , if you are very oily make sure that your foundation is oil free .you can always ask your makeup artist what they would recommend as well .if you are very dry , you do not want an oil free , because that is going to suck whatever oil you have left out of your skin .so make sure you are looking at a foundation that is nourishing , that has moisturizers in it ; and most foundations will say on the bottle , it is say for oily skin or for a dry skin , for mature skin , acne prone skin .all you have to do is read a little bit , and if you have any questions you can always ask your makeup artist or the department store makeup artist , or you can e-mail me.
first , you want to do really big waves .you want to brace yourself on your feet .your back is in the neutral , you have a neutral spine .you 're grounded on the ground and use your arms in front of you .do not pull the rope .so it looks like this .if you noticed , i 'm.
so when women go through puberty , menopause , perimenopause , and pregnancy , their estrogen and progesterone change a lot .that dramatically influence their brain activity , their metabolism , their mood .so acupuncture help to restore the hormone balance during those special period of time , so women can think and work more efficiently .this especially true for women aged between forty to fifty , because that 's the perimenopause period of time , and the hormone fluctuate so much within a day .acupuncture helps to restore this balance so that they can have better mood to control their work efficiency , and anxiety .
i want to show you an improv demonstration.
let 's dive right in to the eighth line , first measure .ok.starts off with that e four four .new bow .fourth finger .ok , that 's the first measure , now , look at my hand , ok.just to scale going down at first .right next to each other half steps .ok , let 's take it at a faster tempo .see ?all you really got to do is really keep practicing it , ok.so it sounds smoother .
try interpreter , when you  re playing interpreter , a couple of pointers on that .just pay attention , listen visually as well as verbally , use the language .the person that doesn  t speak english needs to not understand any of the english that  s spoken in the game , and feel free to use a few devices .you could give a long answer for a short answer , you could give a short answer for a long answer , but only go to devices if you  re not inspired and you  ll find some inspiration as you shop around using some of those devices .but it  s a great game ; you can field questions from the audience .did we have a , a question from the producer down there ?yes , there .did the curtains match the drapes ?very good , do the curtains match the drapes ?let me see if i can find out for you .( gibberish in the form of a question .very emphatic gibberish answer )no.
okay , we 've covered a lot of ground so far .this one is serving into the body .so imagine your opponent is right here waiting for my serve , and he thinks i 'm going to serve short or high or deep or wide in this area , and i just drill one right into his body .okay , now if i catch him napping just a little bit , i can get him with a very weak response .it 'll be like this or like that .i may not win the point out right , but i 'll get a very , very weak response .so once you 've established the ability to hit all these spots , then you can , then just take one right , right into his body because i normally would n't want to serve right down the middle of the service box like that .but if you , if you 've already set him up with a variety of serves , and you have a nice , smooth motion that he does n't really get a feel what you 're going to do , then you just , you just crack it right into the body .and you 'll see that in tennis a lot too .so when you serve into somebody 's body , they have a hard time getting out of their own way .like if the ball was over here , it might be easier sometimes .if you get into the body , a lot of times it 's very tough .and you also can serve down the middle .okay , i do n't always recommend that serve because that might give them a forehand.
i 'm from san francisco , california .i 'm a sponsored skateboarder , and.
this jacket i created to be a jacket.
ok , moving on with home on the range .we 've gotten to a part where we 're going to be repeating .this next phrase is just like the beginning of the song .so we should have landed so that we 're ready to proceed with an up bow on d.so you recognize that phrase from our lesson a little while ago .g , a , b.then we 're going to be doing our g to.
okay , preferred equipment .you 're going to need cleats .depending they make different kind of cleats .these are firm ground cleats .they also make soft grounds and low spike cleats .these are pretty good for this kind of grass .i mean because the grass is n't too high .it 's not too low .so you always want to buy your cleats a little bit big .because if you buy them too small then when you put on these thick socks they 're going to fit you really tight.
the next exercise we 're going to do , sometimes called bridge pose , sometimes called table pose .you 're going to bring your hands behind your back , fingers pointing towards your feet .the knees are bent and you 're going to lift your hips up until they 're level with your knees and shoulders .breathe deeply , if you ca n't stay here with a calm and smooth breath just come back down , when you 're ready come back up .the way to stay here is to use your feet intelligently , press the front of your feet down , tighten the thighs but relax the buttocks .if you 're comfortable here , you could drop your head back .but if there 's pain in your neck just keep your chin into your throat and move the stomach as you breathe .so as you inhale , watch your navel , push the belly up and when you exhale , bring the stomach back down .stay up here for a few more breaths if you can again , if you ca n't stay up , just come down .lean forward take pressure off your wrists and then come back up into the position whenever you can .take a couple more breaths and when you 're done with this just sit back down , stretch your legs out and lie back down on the mat .
when it comes to side kick , look at my feet .i have to swing my body sideways , sideways .but i am kicking with the front leg .sideways , you see that ?sideways , sideways , sideways .now from here , from there , from here .now , from here side kick .from there , from there , from here .the steps , the movements are very small .take a look from here .i am shifting forward and backward .now , the other side same thing .if the kick is right there , take a look.
this step is the third basic throw with two balls in one hand .so , so far we have the outside circle .we have after that the inside circle .and now we learn the columns .the column is about the two balls in one hand and they do not change their position .i just throw straight throws each time .so the ball outside stays always outside and the ball inside stays always inside position .they never change places .something very important about playing with two balls in one hand is that our shoulder is relaxed and our upper arm is relaxed as well .however , we use the biceps.

so making sure the abs are engaged .the key is to keep the abs engaged and at the same time inhale and exhale .ideally , you want to be able to inhale and exhale through the nose .this is something that will definitely come with practice .so to start if you feel you need to inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth that 's perfectly fine .you want to make sure your breaths are long .inhale is long and the exhale is deep and long as well .if at any time you find you 're holding your breath or you lose your breath that means you need to ease up possibly modify or come out of the posture .bring your breath back to a steady pace and then go back into the stretch .each time you exhale is when you 'll find you go deeper into your stretch .this is very important .the easiest way and the quickest way to progress in your stretching is to keep a really strong deep exhale .each time you exhale you should feel the body release just a little bit .so as far as the posture goes you want to make sure.
next , we 're going to stretch our sides , if you have an armrest you can place one arm on the armrest .if you do n't , you can just place it at your side or let your arm hang at the side .so doing the right arm first , we inhale reaching the arm up and then exhale , leaning over to the side .you want to reach the fingertips up to the ceiling and exhale lengthening , deepening the stretch over to the side .making sure , you keep both hips on your seat the entire time .inhale extending reaching up exhale dropping over farther into the stretch .deep breath up , exhale over into the stretch and with your next breath bringing through center and we 'll do the same thing on the other side .again , you can let the arm drop to the side or place it on your armrest .left arm coming up with the inhale and exhale taking it over , keeping both hips on the floor .deep breath in as you reach up and exhale lengthening over to the side .again inhale up and exhaling over , one more breath in , exhale over and then bringing it back to center and feeling how wonderful the effects of that stretch are .
the first batten should be installed with the top corner flushed with the fascia .the second batten is the most important and is installed by chalking a straight line 15 inches from the first batten .as the roof slope increases this dimension should be reduced accordingly .this will allow the front lip of the panel to overhang the fascia .when the eave is crocked , adjust the line down slightly to average this discrepancy while still providing etiquette overhang .when the eave is not parallel or square with the roof , adjust the first course slightly to compensate .if required , additional adjustment can be made in the second course .if the top course is not parallel , adjust or telescope the last course of tile slightly to compensate .extra care should be taken when you have a short tile course as it will display variations .when the roof plan is cut up , you may have to lay out part of the fill from the bottom up as normal and transfer the balance from the top down .in this case it is important to work uniformly down , each side of the roof projections maintaining eave in coursing .the remaining battens are installed at 15 and 13/16 of an inch or 402 millimeters on center .this spacing is crucial to obtain proper panel fit .the most accurate method is to use the batten spacer which will lock into a fasten batten and hold spacing while the next batten is butted to the spacer and fastened .
the common consumer sparkler , or the consumer type of firework , can add a lot of fun and excitement , to most holiday party events .what we 're going to talk about , is proper extinguishment of the sparkler .sparklers come in usually two varieties .this type is made onto a bamboo , or wooden type of stick .the other type , is some type of wire type , of stick .sparklers can burn anywhere from eleven hundred to eighteen hundred degrees .that 's very hot .once the sparkler burns down to the end of it 's life cycle .take the sparkler and bury that hot end , by sticking it into some dry sand , or a close bucket of water that is nearby , for the purpose of extinguishment .it may also be helpful to keep a fire extinguisher handy , just in case , if some type of uneventful fire , happens to take place accidentally .remember the wire , and even the bamboo sticks , can remain hot for an extended period of time , after the sparkler 's life cycle is over , and it burns out .stick it in dry sand , or have a bucket of water handy and close by , for people to drop that wire or bamboo stick into , after extinguishment occurs .i 'm captain joe bruni .stay safe , and we 'll see you next time .
here 's the back side body pass as it passes me just swing my arm.
so , starting with the same c d e f g , and then going down half steps .i 'm going to stop there as well.
in this series , we 're going to talk about some things women can do to keep themselves safe while traveling or when their out and abroad .one of the key areas where attacks often occur is in parking lots .in this case we have an outdoor parking lot .one of the things that you can do to make yourself a little safer is always park underneath a light if it 's going to be dark when you leave .you also want to make sure that as you come in , you check your car , you would look underneath it , look in the back seat , those kind of things .underground parking lots pose a different kind of a problem because there always have limited lighting and that 's a very common scene for attacks .they 're often very deserted and since they 're under ground the public at large does n't have clear view .in addition to the parking under a light one of the things you can do to protect yourself is try to find a closed circuit tv camera that will have your vehicle in frame .they 're usually posted on the building walls , sometimes from the light posts themselves .and that will help to make sure that if something happens that it 's recorded or more importantly that the criminal will see the camera and avoid attacking anybody that 's in the field of view .it 's also important to remember that the camera , it may not be real and it may not be monitored which means it may be running a feed to a recording device.
usually just one tablespoon of brown sugar and 3 tablespoon of conditioner is enough for a normal size head but you could always make more double your receipt if you like .what the brown sugar does it helps to exfoliate the scalp .so it could help with getting rid of dandruff .you are going to want to rub the scalp in circular motions .the person would really enjoy this .it is very relaxing for the person who you give the scalp rub to .then you rinse it well or you could shampoo it out if you choose .the next homemade hair receipt is probably even easier then the first one .it is one teaspoon of honey for four cups of warm water .you just pour it on after you shampoo and leave it on .do not rinse it out and dry your hair as normal .this puts a very nice natural shin on your hair it is not sticky.
if your budget range is sort of low , there is one creative gift that i would enjoy personally to give to my boyfriend and it would be a poster .you can get posters anywhere online ; you can probably go to any store and find posters .one site that has posters is actually viewposters.com .you can just get a huge range of different posters and it would be just a great cheap gift idea that would mean a lot .different stores that you can find posters at would be at wal-mart , target , hastings , barnes and noble and it would definitely be a gift under $ 10 .then if you want to get even more creative , you can get autographed posters .if you want to go all out and find autographed posters , then you can go to ebay and you can find anybody on there .
i 'm a professional artist and.
hi , my name is scott.
so we tried this record at actually a slower speed and we found it was even farther than it was originally .so we do n't need to make it slower we need to make it faster .so let 's just try another one , instead of negative one.
so we 're going to use two units of this , two units of this , and three units of this one .i 'm going to start with this one .we 're going to take a four patch , a square , pin them together , right sides together , and since these are such short seams i just usually use two pins .and that 's together , and i 'm going to take another four patch , and a triangle finishes this one off .we need two of this unit , so we 're going to take a floral square , a four patch and a triangle .on the triangles , i like to make sure it 's the right order.
we 've already cut our strips on bias two and a half inches wide and now.
i 'm a massage therapist in wilmington , north carolina .and , i 'm here to talk about what is hydrotherapy treatment ?hydrotherapy treatment can be incorporated into many different modalities of massage and body work therapy .and basically , it is the use of water in some form , for therapeutic reasons .for example , if you use heated water , it helps to increase circulation to the muscles , and help increase flexibility , and things like that .if you use water , in it 's ice form , it helps to decrease circulation to an area , which is greatly used in the treatment of inflammation .so , water being used in those `` twof '' , two different forms , is typically , used the term hydrotherapy .there 's also hydrotherapy.
hi , in this session , we 're going to talk to you about some acupressure treatments for arthritis in the ankles .most common reasons for arthritis to develop in the ankles is from an injury .that type of thing , being hit by a car , situations like that .what you should do first is speak with your veterinarian , make sure the dog 's had a thorough examine , and that everything has been done possible for them , but then using acupressure techniques , you can do a lot to ease pain , loosen up the stiff joints , and make that joint work much better if you do these particular procedures , and work with your dog at least once or twice a week .ideally every three or four days .and you 'll see some great improvement in how the animal is able to use those joints .so , we 'll show you some tricks and tips on how to do particular work for the ankle specifically and some general points to help use the hips and the rest of the leg when the animal is compensating for the injury from the arthritis .
let 's add a three quarter shimmy to our sharp arabic move .so let 's first do it in place till we have all the parts going in the right direction .let 's have one foot slightly in front , knees are going to be bent , pulled that belly button in .and we 're going to start with the weight , the leg in the front that 's taking the weight .so we 're going to first do like , one , two , up , up and down , down and up , up .down down in the front , up up in the back .down down , up up .takatak takatak .good .now the back foot is going to propel us forward , so when we take weight in the back , it 's going to free up our foot in the front so that we can travel .so let 's try that .so , travel up .now let 's speed it up .tak takatak , takatak , takatak , takatak , takatak .other way .tak takatak , takatak .make sure you keep your chest nice and lifted.
so the first double stop we are going to look at is b and f so to get up to the b in second , to get the f you need to put down your third finger first.

well , fruityloops comes with plenty of its own effects and they are actually really good and you can do pretty much do whatever you want with them .sometimes third party developers make their own effects through the vst format .i do n't really know what vst stands for.
okay let 's combine what we 've learned in this series and use all these techniques so that we can individualize and play to the music , the train beat .and what i did here is i combined both the bio.
if i 'm going into this corner.
playing games with children has to be one of the first things that you 're going to do while babysitting .babysitting games can entail anything from coloring to playing with their toys , and even going outside .the most important thing to remember is that the games that you play are going to depend on the age level of the children that you watch .infants and toddlers are going to enjoy games that involve motor skills .for many of them , they 're finally having an understanding of their own physical motor skills .many times , playing with toys that they have in their room will help them aid in this development .pick out toys that you can see in their room that are what you would call educational ; things that they can grasp , things that they can pick up , things that they can not only pick up , but also put into other toys .this motor skill is one of the first things that children need to start learning .if you feel uncomfortable playing with their toys , or you do n't see any immediate toys that would aid in their motor skill development , simply by picking up a marker or a crayon and getting them a blank sheet of paper will also work on their motor skills .for many of them this activity is not only fun , but gives them ' a sense of independency .for older children ; their games are going to be a lot different than the developmental stage .many of them are finally having an understandinment of fantasy , so they enjoy playtime , they enjoy make believe , and they enjoy mimicking adults .go through their room and look for toys that will aid in this type of development .many of them have dress up clothes .dress up can be a wonderful time ; not only for boys but also for girls .having them pretend to be somebody that they know , whether it 's a doctor or a fireman gives em ' that sense of understanding of what people do in real life .older children may also enjoy playing on the computer .many times , mom and dad have allowed them to do so.
in this example of harmonized chords , i 'm going to branch out a little bit where i 'm actually skipping a string .for example , what i 'm going to be doing here , and i 'm going to be playing in the key of e minor , is going , starting with my root note e , and then going , pinching on the d and the b strings together .in this case it would be b and g.
but you do n't do any of that wrapping around the pinky or these two fingers .loose it over the palm and hold the yarn with your thumb and forefinger and wrap and keeping a handle on the yarn with your thumb and forefinger , make your knit stitch and continue on again .wrap and over .you 're not really throwing anything although i guess the name came from just throwing this like so .like many things in knitting , the logic is sometimes a bit flawed .so wrap under and over and you 're not really holding on so much here for tension.
okay , so now that we have this piping made , i have maybe about two , three yards of it .i 'm going to show you a couple of installation tricks , for whatever project you might want to use it on .the first one i 'm going to do is just a straight seam , and no curves , just straight .so this might be something that you could put maybe at the bottom of a curtain or.
when you get newspaper articles or you get magazine articles or even it comes down to when you do interviews .and if you do interviews on -- for tv shows , you keep it all in one package .and when you have somebody who might be a potential sponsor , they 're going to want to learn as much about you as they can .a lot of times , they might be so far away that they ca n't come and get a one-on-one with you , but by having a packet together that you can pass on , that gives them a little bit of an idea of what you 're all about .mainly , you can mail a hundred of those out and not have one hit , but if you mail one out to the right person that might be the hit .so do n't just mass mail people .too often , everybody 's getting hit up for money .and a lot of times , the first thing , when they hear anything about , `` hey , i want money for -- to go racing , '' they 're going to shutdown because you 've lost sight of what you actually are .you 're there as a billboard for them.
here 's another shot that comes up quite often in pool .we 've got both balls , our cue ball and our object ball , both frozen to a rail on the same side of the table .now the obvious way to make this shot if we want to pocket this ball into that corner pocket .the obvious way would be just to stroke it right down the rail to contact that point .problem is , generally on most tables , they 're not player friendly in the case that you can actually get that cue ball to stay on that rail .what happens is , a lot of time , with some of these places you go into where the cloth has really been played on a lot , really worn a lot .it has a track along here , where the base of the ball rides around these rails .it will build up a track that the ball wants to stay in .and then , when it gets over , if it 's coming down the rail like so it gets over to the side pocket.

why is he playing the nine ?so that pretty much is giving you information that you can , and then he plays small , small .so now you play the king and low and behold your partner plays the six of diamonds .okay , these are the plays , this has already been played .the king and now the six .so now that tells you that you can play the ten and say the queen comes out and on the third round your partner plays the three .so now you play this , another ten or perhaps the opponent stuffs the queen or the jack under the king .now your partner has now played the three of diamonds .so that 's very wonderful because now you can play the deuce of diamonds in complete comfort .your partner has basically walked the suit down for you .so he 's telling you.
time now for a trivia question regarding bandages .let me extricate it here from its paper prison .and the question .what is the fear of doctors called ?this is multiple choice , inverse alphabetical order .is that sciaphobia , nephaphobia , iatraphobia or blenophobia ?now the prize , the only prize for the correct answer is one pat on the back that you 'll have to administer yourself .which is a heck of a lot better than a slap on the belly with a wet trout !now , what is your answer on that ?sciaphobia ?no .it 's iatraphobia .for the record sciaphobia , the fear of shadows , nephaphobia , the fear of clouds and blenophobia , the fear of slime .just in case you 're ever on that millionaire show or jeopardy .now we have a recent study from england , that indicates that some individuals are actually addicted to wearing bandages .these are often cases of individuals who had some surgical procedure or serious injury where bandages were applied .and they 've now become addicted to wearing them .in one case a woman was wearing them for twenty-two consecutive years .now it is n't a problem .bandages are n't that expensive .however a few individuals apparently have been sneaking into hospitals to get high quality bandages for their addiction .now you might ask .how would you know if someone has a bandage addiction ?well perhaps you might see them walking down the street with a bandage on their nose .and perhaps , if i can get this off , just to give you an idea of how you 'd know if someone has a bandage addiction .so you see someone walking down the street , like this .suspect strongly that that individual is addicted to wearing bandages .yes !

what i 'll be performing here is a zottman dumbbell preacher curl , which is different from the traditional dumbbell preacher curl .what 's different from it , is when you bring the dumbbell up and squeeze it .after you squeeze it , you 're going to turn the dumbbell around palms facing down to the ground and controlling it still .and , then at the bottom of the motion you want to turn your wrist around palms up and curl it back up again .so , again twist it on top palms facing down .control it going down .on the bottom of the motion , twist it palms facing up .and , you want to do about three sets to about eight to ten reps with this motion .control it .bring it up .flex the biceps .and , then you want to go ahead alternate it .flex the biceps .switch the angle , palms down .on the bottom switch it , palms up .squeeze the bicep .and , that 's how you perform the zottman dumbbell preacher curl .

most of the sugar melted and some sugar stayed on top .and i want to show you.
hi !my name is jesus cardoso , and i  m going to teach you how to decide on how loud should a vocal track be in the mix .first of all , we need to consider what style of music are we talking about .many times for rock , it is very good to have a vocal track as loud as the guitarist .the guitarists are the ones that basically give the rock feel to the song .in rock bands , nobody likes to have the vocals as loud as the guitarist .if we  re talking about pop , the vocal normally tries to stand out a little bit from everything else .especially , if we  re talking about a song where the artist or the singer is the main person .let .
the phoenix monkey is one of the hardest freestyle maneuvers in a hole .what the paddler does is reach across their bow to cast water on the power face of your paddle .you 're then going to do a pirouette .once i get back to facing forward again , i 'm going to reach up to the sky and initiate a loop , tuck forward , throw my loop , and finish with my paddle behind me .a lot of the motion gets done off this one blade .the pirouette pulls me around , and then at the tail end of the loop i can pull this paddle backwards to throw my feet back in front of me .with the phoenix monkey the goal is to really stay right close to the hole .different holes are easier or harder to do these in , so find a good hole .find that sweet spot of the hole , move around , try it in different locations .
today i 'm going to talk to you all about the history of lavender .so , the name lavender comes from the latin name `` lavare '' which means to wash.and , it was used quite a bit in the olden days by romans as a dressing on their wounds during wars .but , there 's a lot of references to lavender in the bible using the name `` spikenard .
in this example i 'm going to show another variation of alternate melody , this time in addition to pinches , throwing in a hammer on and again using some open strings and.
alright , so on this tutorial i 'm going to touch base on contrast .my contrast is something i like to do to always.
the little separation in between the two hands in between the activity what we are doing with the two hands .we learned already how to play with two balls in one hand .but we have n't used so far the other hand during all this time .of course you can make a lot of different kind of separation.
it 's going to involve overhand punch into a pancake throw off of a basic grip .this is good for a combat sambo competition where you wear the jacket or you could use this in mma as well with no jacket .so from here , we 're going to use our overhand punch as an entrance for our underhook to do the throw .okay ?i have a grip on his sleeve ; he 's got a grip.
okay so as you can see we 've completed our candlesticks here .and you can see how they will look when there 's a candle inside of them .very nice presentation .so there are a few things i 'd like to review in regards to preparing for the first firing .which is the bisque firing .first of all , this is the last time we 're going to be able to do any tooling .so any kind of decoration you want to do where you 're gouging into the clay or making marks , now 's the time to do it .i 'll flip it over and put my name into the side of it .which i like to do with all of my parts .to show you how the clay is still workable .and the date .may sixth .in preparing these to dry these , it is important to know that you want them to dry out nice and evenly .often times the tops will dry out too quickly .you can actually develop cracks in the clay if this happens .so you do n't want that .so if you 're in a very dry environment you might want to take a spray bottle and simply spray them down .if it 's really dry you might want to put some paper towel around it and put plastic on it .you just want to understand that the clay wants to dry out nice and evenly .when it 's dry.
now bring your head back.
on this bracelet , we 're going to have a skull that we 're going to attach with a split ring .a split ring is like a key ring .it goes around in a circle and has an end that you use to attach the charm .what i do is stick my fingernail in between the wires on the split ring and just roll .twist it through .this way your charm is going to dangle on your bracelet.
i 'm here to answer the question.
so now what we 're going to do is get our shoulder dimensions , our shoulder dimensions , and that is going to be from the back from the shoulder seam here and the shoulder seam here , the fullness between the two , and you 're going to need someone to help you out because it 's going to go from down there all the way across to there .and i 'll draw it out.
the next one of our moves is going to be a double arm bar .this position is done from someone getting hold of your shoulders .okay .so this where melissa is grabbing to my shoulders this way .again , this action is very simple to perform .i 'm going to bring both of my hands through the inside of her arms this way , okay .as you do it , this is a wedging action .this wedging action is going to loosen the grip this way .i 'm going to circle the arms around this way and pull them into my body .from the in position , my hands rotate up , okay , so i 'm locking her palms under my armpits , my forearms are in her elbows .now from here i lean my body up and lift our arms this way .now this one you have to be very careful as you 're working with your partner , `` go ahead and grab again melissa '' , because they do n't have a hand free to go ahead and tap .so you have to perform this one go ahead light and easy .if you go too fast , they have nothing to tap.
, they feel like they 're driven by a motor , they feel that it 's never quiet in their heads .this is where complications with sleep can happen with adhd .the minute you lay down to try and rest.
now , i will show how to sew the strips on to our carpet .i 've already started sewing the strips on as you can see .what you do is you take the folded strip that has already been cut and lay it , start right at that starting line , and lay it right along our one inch marker .if you want , you can put in pins to hold it in place .and remove the pins as you sew .and then you put it on the machine , using a normal stitch , at 2 1/2 stitch length .you want to sew like right about 1/4 inch here on the edge .you are going to sew right along that fold and keep the edge right up to the line that 's been marked .so start by backing up a bit .now , remember that you 're using a heavy needle , a jeans needle , or heavy duty needle , depending upon what your machine instructions call for .and remove the pins as you go .and continue down until the end .and then you sew on all of the strips in the same way .all folding flat in one direction .now i am going to show you what to do as your carpet gets longer.
in this video , i 'm going to be talking about juggling three balls in one hand .this is a hard trick .this actually might not work very well until after you 've mastered four or five balls , even .but conceptually , the trick 's very easy .all you 're doing is juggling three in one hand .just like you juggled two , you 're going to add a third one , and they 're all going to go a lot higher and a lot faster .so just show you what this looks like .three in one hand looks something like that .if you remember from when we learned four balls , this is actually a fountain pattern .that is , each throw is moving from the center to the outside .there are other patterns you can use .another common one is cascade .if you remember , the normal three ball cascade is just like this .we just throw across and side to side .you can do the same thing with just one hand .again it 's very high , it 's very stretched out vertically , but it looks something like this .if you can tell , it might be a little hard at first , but the balls are actually traveling in a cascade pattern and my hand is moving side to side underneath , throwing up to the right , then up to the left .when you practice this trick , just really give yourself enough time .throw those balls high , try and get them all the same height and all the same timing .practice it a lot .and this is a difficult trick , but when you incorporate it into a normal three ball pattern , people are very impressed .
what we 're going to talk about and discuss , is how to properly inspect the firefighting part of the ensemble , known as protective hand wear or the glove .the gloves are a very important part of the ensemble where there should be no holes whatsoever or no loose stitching .gloves can wear out rather quickly under heavy use and mechanical damage .as we can pull and tug on each part of the seams to make sure our stitching is all intact , we can go over each finger one at a time to make sure that we do not have a hole or a problem in those areas .we then want to inspect to make sure our inner liner and thermal barrier stitching is still intact .on some gloves , there 's a short gauntlet made of nomex , that also needs to be intact , and now on these gloves , there 's not .we take these gloves to inspect them and feel to make sure all the fingers are intact while again inspecting for any holes or physical damage and to make sure none of the fingers and the inner liner has pulled free from them.
you have this great big bowl and what if you only have a half of cup to cream to whip or two or three egg whites .that is what only that is the speed is for your mixer .it 's a little bit harder to over whip something when you have a small amount of it .so this is what the fastest speed is going to be for it 's going to be able to get into small amounts of egg whites or cream .so that you can whip it up properly even if you do n't have a half of bowl full .so we 're going to turn it all the way up to ten.
and now we 're going to talk about `` looming shade '' .`` looming shade '' [ technical ] and now we 're going to discuss `` looming shade '' .`` looming shade '' is out of the basic set .it has been around since the beta .it is the creature `` shade '' .once again , `` shades '' were very very popular when magic first got started .it is a common card , which means you can find it in your booster packs or at any gaming store for 20 to 25 cents , and `` looming shade '' cost you 2 and a black to play , which means its converted mana cost is 3.now , with the converted mana cost of 3 , you 're getting a 1/1 , which once again , you 're paying 2 extra for a 1/1 , which means that it 's going to have an ability .the ability on looming shade is very powerful because if you pay 1 black , looming shade gets +1/+1 until end of turn .now what this means is that , as long as you have black mana , you can play this.
okay our next step is going to be is to clean this piece of wood where we 've got the patch out .it has to be very , very clean.
okay in this next section we 're going to go ahead and remove our tail pipe.
and he 's off balance trying to make a tackle on the quarterback and the quarterback will either step up in the pocket or scramble to the outside .the defensive tackle worked that hard for nothing .we want to make sure we break down .on this play , we 'll have a running back coming hard to his right side .if the defensive guy does n't first take a good angle and then break down that running back will run out around .the running backs will always be faster and quicker than the defensive tackles .we 're going to show what this looks like when he gets in the backfield ( video demo ) .he breaks through , he 's going to get out , he does a great job of breaking down .he did n't just run by the play and let this guy cut back inside of him .he gets outside , he breaks down , then he explodes up and makes a good tackle .you have to do that in order to be a good defensive tackle or you 'll waste a lot of effort for nothing .
welcome back , we 're in a lotus 111 car this time , it differs from the ninety-six elise in that it has a little more horse power , but the layout is the same , so you want to use the same techniques that you learned using the other lotus and apply it to this lotus .so here we go , same thing as the other lotus , it does n't have much power , but it does have a little more -so you have to be careful with your throttling.
alright , drink we 're about to make is called flat tire .and we 're going to make this as a shot or two .put some ice in a glass , we 're going to go ahead and chill the ingredients .make it nice and smooth when we take it down .alright , two shots of tequila .there 's one , and two , eventually .and one shot of black sambuka .there we go .stop .alright , let 's go ahead and chill those ingredients .so if you run out of jagermeister at your bar or the bar you go to does n't have jagermeister , but they happen to have tequila and black sambuka , you can go ahead and just ask for a flat tire .it 's going to taste pretty similar .okay , grab your strainer and two shot glasses , and go ahead and pour .there 's one , and two .so you see , it 's not so bad having a flat tire .bottoms up .
alright you just learned 2-5 in b major .now i am just doing 5 's .two 5 's in every key .now you can just pick out keys e flat , g flat ,b flat , c ,e flat , so it is an important tool compositionally and just to get all the scales under your fingers .so you can just go forever and.
okay , monkeys inside out .i 've got the leg folded over .i 'm going to start close to the fold.
hi.
after blockers have been declared , the combat damage step occurs .during this step all damage is assigned as follows .the power of any unblocked creature is assigned to the defending player , the power of creatures that have been blocked , and are blocking are assigned to each other .the grizzly bears assigned 2 damage to the honor guard ; the honor guard only assigns 1 damage , the grizzly bears .now there 's an opportunity once the damage has been assigned to activate abilities that can be played anytime instance are played .this ability can be used because there 's 2 white men available to save the honor guard from dying to the grizzly bears .at this point the ability will be activated twice giving it 0 , 2 until end of turn , this makes it a 1/3 , that means that it will survive the 2 points of damage the grizzly bears deals to it .the grizzly bears still survive because it 's only still dealing 1 point of damage to the grizzly bears .once the ability has been activated , the damage is dealt , that reduces the life total of the defending player by 1 point because the scryb sprites were n't blocked .
now we ? re going to go in to your , first off before we go any further in to anything .writing any kind of verses we ?re going to discuss bars .here goes the thing about bars .there measures there counts .i use to think that a bar was every two rhyme words when ever i was young and that 's wrong .cause sixteen bar verses then was turned into thirty two bar verses it 's a measure .like depending on the speed of the beat will be the measure .but let ?s just say it 's a regular tempo beat like.
when you start practicing linking spins in flat water , what you 're really focusing on is the timing of when you switch your edges and when you switch the rotation of your torso to keep your body in front of your boat .when linking spins what i 'm first doing is bow pivot turn , which is a reverse sweep and sinking bow down , and then catching myself on a stern pivot turn for the next end .sinking the stern down and pulling the bow back around .this is the way that we spin in holes or just doing some nice flat spins even .the timing is really important .every time that i 'm sideways , my paddle can only be on my downstream side , and my up stream edge has to be up .anytime that i 'm in line or straight onto it , now my boat can be nice and flat .when i link spins , i begin with a lot of edge , flat in the middle , a lot of edge , flat at the end .that way i 'm continually pulling the boat around .the other that changes with our sweep strokes with this is the first pivot turn is the same .once i get to backwards , i do n't need to start all the way up my toes because it wastes time .i 'll actually start just at my hip here.
powerade is the main sponsor on that.
okay now we 're moving on to our next area in our loft .this is our dining area and here are the materials that are needed .we are using a rectangle folding table , a folding chair 2 folding chairs , a decanter a glass is for our shelf back there , some wine , a cup , a coffee maker , a container with utensils , and that stuff is for our shelving unit on here and at the bottom of the shelving unit is a small refrigerator .for actual table a side with tables and chairs we have 2 small area rugs and the colors that are in this room will be green and black .we 're going to put these under the table we have 2 cups , 2 plates , 2 place mats and a chinese lantern that will hubber over the table .
you could practice this from standing position .so start with your fist to your hips .okay , chest straight out , elbows pulled back .okay , now the fist , you want to start by slowly coming out with the form rubbing against the side of the hip and the rib .okay , you want to twist out and then twist the fist over the last second .okay , now with the punch , if you notice his shoulders , after he throws the punch , okay , you want your shoulders almost in a completely straight line and the fist parallel .it 's very important that you rotate the shoulder .if you punch squared like this , okay , this puts unneeded tension right here on top of the shoulder and there 's no power coming in .all the power 's coming from the side , see , and you could be push back easily .very important that you twist all the way out to get the proper extension.
now , she is just going to rest there for just a moment .she can take her hands down while i bring the pillow for just in case .it 's always good to have a pillow as a safety measure in case you fall backwards .and she is going to bring her hands behind her ankles .good , and press her palms in to ground .good .she 's then going to use her core to lift her body up and bring her legs out to the side .good .she 's pressing her inner thighs onto her upper arms and her upper arms into her inner thighs .good.
when is our painting finished ?when it captures the mood that you are trying to capture .the level of detail you put in is irrelevant .we can work this for another ten , twelve hours and put in every little spot and every little detail , or we can stop now .or , we could 've stopped an hour ago , or two hours ago .make no difference , it 's entirely subjective .the art is n't the important thing , the important thing is the process .art is n't about creating pictures , it 's about training your eye how to see .if you train your eye how to see things like shadows and light , when you look at the world , you 'll see so much more than you can possibly imagine if you do n't go through the process of practicing visualization .leanardo devinci was n't a great artist because he wanted to be an artist , he was a great artist because he was a scientist trying to study nature , and the way he studied nature was by observing .and the process of drawing and painting forced him to see things the way nobody had ever seen things before .this a nice bi-product of the process , but what it 's all about is really learning how to use your eyes in ways that you ca n't learn how to use your eyes in any other way .the process is more important than the painting .it 's nice to have a painting , but it 's even nicer to be able to see things that nobody else can see when you look at a still life .enjoy the process .
okay .so we 're nearly done with this one .i check out our outline and see if we need to make any more shadows to make sure that 's nothing 's blending too much into the background here .we could start to work on the background a little bit .we do need to work some issues with the outline shadows particularly on this ear .and we can also define it by putting alignment at the background .that 's better , and so i really like it .okay .let 's see .it 's about riving in as you go and work on the background and filling the background more , there 'll be more definition in this outline and the face will come out a little bit more .
as your dog becomes older , becomes geriatric , they might not be as comfortable having some of the maintenance done on them .your care , nail care , coat care .it 's very important that you maintain a routine with these guys .you might need to get a softer more gentle brush .certainly , the hair is going to be growing and shedding .sometimes they actually start shedding a little bit more , so you just want to do a gentles , soft ...
what we 're going to do is a criss cross through the ladder and we 're going to do ali 's , an ali shuffle with the hands .now what this means is remember , when you workout we got three plays of motion .we 're working in a transverse playing motion here , so you in out , in out , in out , in out , in out , in out , dropping it down here bringing the hand into the circle , back into the circle , back ...
well everybody knows that the camera is the most important tool for a photographer .not everybody knows that the tripod comes in at a close second .it 's very important when you 're a photographer to always have the tripod with you .you never know if you 're going to need it for a low light situation .you never know if you 're going to need it to have the camera in the exact same position every time you 're taking a photo .and you never know if you 're going to need it just to allow yourself to step away from the camera for little bit as well .tripods , like i said , i really ca n't say enough about them .if you do n't have one , you need to go out and get one , and just make sure you always have it with you because you 'll never know when you need it and a lot of photographers can look at an image and tell if it was shot with a tripod or not .because typically an image shot with a tripod is going to have a much crisper look to it and everything is going to be sharp and in focus , and when you 're taking photographs , that 's what you want .you want things to be as crisp as possible , as sharp as possible and as in focus as possible .
if you 're going to learn how to skateboard the first thing you 're going to need to learn is how to push .the easiest way to figure that out is to have a friend stand behind you and push you forward.
let 's talk about to talk about how to stop your dog from chasing their tail .one of the first things you need to do is try to determine why is your dog chasing his or her tail .is it because they 're bored , they 're overly hyperactive or it 's an enjoyable activity ?it is something you can put on cue for your dog if they seem to enjoy.
now the derailer hanger is the small tab of metal that your derailer mounts into .typically when you crash or your bike gets dropped the hanger acutally bends and not the derailer .so , to remedy the situation , you actually need to remove the derailer and straighten out that tab , and align it back in line with the drive train .to do that you will use a five millimeter allen wrench on the center of this bolt here on the derailer , and just going to remove that .you can do that with the chain attached .typically easier if you shift it into the smallest cog first .so once you 've dropped the derailer down , you can clearly see the derailer hanger , and this is a special tool that is used for straightening the derailer hangers , it 's just called a derailer hanger alignment gage .this threads into the derailer hanger and uses the rear wheel as the gage for being in line .so for this you just thread this in , and then you use this metal rod as a guide , and you just push this up against the braking surface of the rim , set it down , and check it directly across at ninety , make sure that that should fall directly against the rim as well .here it 's a little inside , so you just bend it a little .reset it , and check it .then you also do it for ,yeah .basically check this all the way around .it should maintain the same distance to the rim all the way around .once you have gotten that straight , you then remove this , re-install the derailer .that 's how to straighten a derailer hanger .

my best wood that i prefer if i had one wood to choose out of all the trees would be the sycamore .sycamore grows anywhere , almost anywhere in america .where there is water , there is usually wood .even here in the desert , where there is dry wooded bed , all around lake montezuma , here in cottonwood , cornville , there is plenty of sycamore , dried creek beds .you will find limbs and stuff like cottonwood is a good wood .especially in the inner side , inside the bark , not the roots , the native americans , the hoppies use to roots .but the inside is a nice firm wood .so this is in between hard and soft .what i am going to do is split this down the middle.

in this clip , we 're going to talk about the proper service procedure for removing and replacing a front strut on a front-wheel drive vehicle .in this step , we 're going to talk about the proper service procedure for aligning our upper mount and remounting it .as you can see , there is a little nipple here .that nipple is going to point out , away from the vehicle , straight to the tire .we 're going to want to line that up with the center of our strut mount portion that goes to the spindle .just like so .once you have these aligned , you 're ready to mount the upper portion .now on the body of the vehicle , there will be a corrosion mark which will indicate where this part goes .as you can see , we have a corrosion mark from where our upper mount seats to the body of the vehicle .and what we 're looking for is an indicator tab .that will let us know the proper alignment for installing our new strut .as you can see , there is a little dimple right here .that 's what we 're looking for .there will be a corresponding dimple on the mount .we 're going to want to make sure to line those two up when we install it on the vehicle .i 'm going to go ahead and slip it up inside the vehicle and starts with my nuts on the top .just like so .i 'm going to take and hold onto a coil and grab one of my nuts and get it started on there .alright , i 'm going to go ahead and tighten them down .we 'll use a x pattern for torquing this down .they do n't have to be extremely tight , you can break them .right there is good .i 'm going to jump all the way across to this one and perform an x pattern .what that will do is ensure that it seats nice and flat to the inside surface of our suspension tower .jump over here .and then diagonally across to complete our x pattern .and there you go .that is the proper service procedure for aligning and remounting your upper strut mount .
we used a regular light .it produces enough heat to dry the nails .you can also use a fan , which will provide a constant air source to dry them .if you do n't dry your nails completely , then you could end up with polish on your clothes .you 're going to smudge the polish and the nail art if you 've put any on , which will then have to be completely removed and done all over again .so you always want to make sure that they are completely dry .if , when you gently touch the tip of them , you do n't want to just smash your finger down on it , but you gently touch it , if it does n't seem dry , it 'll feel a little tacky.

i 'm beau timken , master sake sommelier .in this segment we 're speaking about ginjo sake and specifically we 're talking about how do you drink ginjo sake .what do you drink it out of , if you will ?now , again , i have a theory that drinking alcohol is a luxury and drink out of whatever you want to make you happy .if it 's time , place and occasion , tpo , drink out of whatever glassware that people have and you 'll enjoy it all the same .but if you specifically want to test ginjo sake , for a vessel that will really put it through its paces , i would recommend a white wine glass , like a vienne chardonnay glass .where , you know , maybe i 'd do a little bit bigger bowl something very delicate , very soft .ginjo is supposed to represent sort of delicate , light , clean , soft , aromatic qualities .so , a ginjo , you know it 's difficult to drink out of something like this .and in fact , this comes from way back centuries ago when they used to drink sake out of seashells .it 's actually , this kind of glassware is the modern day version of the seashell .but ginjo sake , typically , should be consumed chilled .i would say sort of out of the refrigerator , right up , straight up.
what we 'll cover at this point is finishing the outside of the bowl .typically you would like to get a piece of sand paper and fold it into thirds .this gives you a little bit of a padding as you go in .i will be using a 120 grit to start with .as this goes around you will see a number of lines and.
if you get to the point in a diabolical puzzle where you have potentially three numbers left going in a column and probably three numbers going in a row and they intersect essentially what you do is , you start by selecting one of the numbers and go up with the other potential numbers and go across with the other potential numbers and see if that fits .when it doesn  t you back up the same way you put the numbers in , so you end up back at the same square .now you take one of the other potential numbers and go up and go across and see how that fits ,if that doesn  t complete that column and that row you back up the same way you put the numbers on.
the difference between cranking amps and cold cranking amps is the amount of juice your battery can send to the starter at different temperatures .your battery is going to be rated for two specific things , above 32 degrees and below 32 degrees .cold cranking amps is below 32 degrees .if there 's ice on the road , your cold cranking amps are going to matter .if you suspect your battery is beginning to get weak.

the other two vegetables we 're going to be adding here , are mushrooms and zucchini , so we 're also going to slice our mushrooms , as we did our red peppers and onions , and we 're going to take our zucchini , and we 're going to cut off the ends .then , we 're going to do these like we did the carrots , in little disks .all right , now we 're going to prepare our rosemary , so what we can do , is either pick off each leaf individually , like that , or you can grab about three quarters of the way up , and you can tell where it starts to get soft .that 's where you want to grab , and then you can just pull down , and all of the little leaves will come off .then , you can go ahead , and pick the leaves off the top , avoiding the stem .mince and turn , and.
side crunch side laying on the ball with the elbow out .if this is the first clip that you happened to find , i would highly recommend that you check the previous clips on this series to learn how to get into the position , or even further back to learn how to do the exercise kneeling with ball support .cause this is a progression and you happen to stumble upon something that 's a little more challenging , a little more advanced .however , i 'm going to show you how to do it .what you want to do is wedge the ball , okay ,your outside leg with the foot support and.

it is an uncommon , and once again , it will cost you forty ; fifty cents at your local gaming store .it is an artifact ; phyrexian vault costs 3 to play , is 3 colorless , and it 's a very powerful card , because it gives you an option that most artifacts wo n't give you .but it 's 2 and a tap , sacrifice a creature , draw a card .now the reason you would play this is a , you get to draw a card ; b , is because you get to sack a creature .now some people do n't like to sacrifice creatures ; however , people who play black and red know that a lot of creatures have ; when they go into the graveyard from play , they have abilities , like they do damage , or they deal loss life , or a creature gets minus something , minus something until end of turn .so , you need a way to sack the creature .well , this artifact right here , which is cheap , gives you a way to not only sack the creature , and yield those benefits , but it also allows you to draw a card .this makes this card very powerful , especially in blue/black control domination decks .
i can even add a little bit more .i 'm doing the inside stroke .exaggerated serifs.
another category of english clocks is really a hybrid .they 're called anglo-american clocks .the cases , all the decorative part you can see here , were made in england , but the movements were , were inexpensive american , connecticut , movements that were imported to put in these cases .as a lot of the cost of english clocks was in the old fashioned , high quality method of making the movements .so if they could get an inexpensive movement , and put it in an attractive case , that was something they could do and sell a less expensive , less expensive clock in england .these were typically quite ornate .you can see in this case , we have inlayed silver or mother of pearl in the case .they often have this kind of school clock design , as you see , but they come in other designs as well .inside is probably a movement made by new haven or one of the connecticut companies , it would , in this case , it 's just a timepiece , you see , but often they were time and strike as well , and at least some of the history suggests that these cases made in england were made by very skilled italian craftsmen who were coming to england in order to better themselves , to find better paying jobs .so they were very skilled and they were available for work at a reasonable wage .so a lot of these anglo-american clocks were made by very skilled craftspeople of the time .
and then the power ball will come out of the orange one .and now we 've trapped our power ball or we will have trapped it , in an infinite loop .you can see that it 's just coming out of the orange portal and going into the blue one .but what we can do now is , since we know where the receptacle is.

hi , have you ever wondered about the history of a massage chair .well , i 'm going to tell you a little bit today .i 'm sundae , with natural sundae .now , the first massage chair was invented in 1986.it weighed thirty-six pounds , and came in a wooden box that quickly expanded into a massage chair .now , this was a little bit heavy .thirty-six pounds is n't that much , but if you 're lugging it from location to location and it can be quite tiring .so , it took about ten years , but ten years later , in 1996 , a new version of a massage chair was built out of metal which made it much lighter for the therapist to carry around , and much more comfortable for the client to sit in ; specifically because it contained more padding in the head rest and in the chest guard , which is what my client is sitting in right now .it helps pad the chest , and for ladies this is very important .and then , also you see this chair down here , the seat .so , padding was very , very important and this was embellished a little bit more when the chair was reinvented .so , it took a little while , but the massage chair now enjoys many different kinds and varieties , and there are hundreds of different table , table and chair manufacturers out there , so it 's important to pick the one that you like .there are different colors , and and different sizes , and there 's a very large variety out there .so , good luck pickin ' your chair , and i 'm sundae , with natural sundae.
in this clip , we 're going to go over the strike zone .the first thing you got to do , get behind the plate , call a play in , play ball .now it 's your job get in position right straight over the catcher 's head .so you can see both sides of the plate without moving .you got a nice peripheral vision of home plate there .now , stay in position you make your call .in little league , it 's right below the letters right there .that 's a good call and then down to the knees .now in little league , some guys they throw the ball on an arc .so its a little more difficult to call a strike when you have an arc because its where it crosses the plate , not where it ends up in the mitt .where it crosses the plate .now , this is called a paint .you can throw over the corners , that 's the paint .that 's a good pitch if you throw over the paint .a good pitcher always hits the paint every pitch , paint , paint , paint .so , throw them hard , throw them fast , throw them straight .over the plate get a strike , got them out .
today i am going to show you on how to make a collage for toddlers .the first thing that you should do is gather different materials.
next thing we 're going to talk about.
there are several brands .i 'm not saying that these are the best or the worst or the most expensive or the least .there are so many different prices and so many different kinds .if you can find them at someone 's yard sale , go ahead and get them .it 's worth just trying them to see if you like them .they 're very unusual .they 're like a crayon .they can be blended just like oil ; they 're oil based .you probably ca n't see too much going on yet with that , but you will in a second i think if i can get the right colors for this .now see with a crayon , there would be all bumpy and spaces in between , but this one is not .it 's actually blending just like oil .it 's getting a lot softer and you can go out the edges blending .if you were making a picture with this , you could use it for highlights , you could use it for shadowing .that 's a very poor , small example of this .we 'll keep doing this here for a second to maybe show you a piece of sky or some clouds poking thru .i have used my finger and.
the easiest way to get your stencil onto the vinyl is to cut a piece of vinyl that is about the size of where you want to put it .you 're going to put your piece of paper that has your pattern on it , you can put it on the vinyl , or the vinyl on it , and then you 're going to put another piece of vinyl on the back .so you 're making a vinyl sandwich with your stencil .so this is the one piece of vinyl on the top ,my piece of paper that has my graphic is underneath the top piece of vinyl , then there 's another piece of vinyl on the back , and we take the paper off of the vinyl on the back , and then this one 's going to go on this plate .so , we will just place it in the middle of a plate and cut off , smooth it .now if you get edges , like on here , we have some of these edges sticking up , you can just cut them off or fold them over .sometimes you might have a little bit of edging here that sticks out , we 're going to cut that off and just trim it up to make it easier to work with.
malt is usually going to come in two different forms .you have your malt extracts , you can get a dry version which is a little more concentrated than the liquid versions but a little more expensive .or , you can get the liquid extract which is like a very , very thick syrup .the other form of malts that you are going to be adding to really kind of flesh out the character of the beer that you are making are specialty grains .these are grains that have been roasted somewhat differently , maybe steeped for a little while .and basically they are going to add some of your more complex flavors .when you get your specialty grains , your local home brewing store will help you mill them like this .this will open up the grain allowing extraction of the sugar and the color .next we have hops .and there are two major forms of hops that are available .there is whole hops , which you can see right here .this is actually just the cone of the hop .and then there is also pellet hops which is basically.
we are going to have emily here coming into some nice leg extensions to kind of finish off her practice today .she is laying on her side , hands together in pray , neck is comfortable .yes !perfect and it kind of using the hip open and then take it to the next level .so we are working with the breath very slowly .inhale , lift the knee , open up that hip .excellent !extend the leg all the way up pressed to that heel .inhale bend the knee .exhale and release all the way back down to the knee .doing it again inhale , open up the hip .exhale , extend the leg .perfect !inhaling bend the knee , exhale release back and bend the knee closing that hip up .one last time inhale , open up the hip , lift the knee .exhale extend.
definitely money well spent .very fun , just enjoyable .if you stay with one of the better brands at a bike store , you will get a bike that will be backed up by the manufacturer , in most cases lifetime warranty on the frame and a year on the parts .if anything is going to happen , usually we notice it out of the box if it 's a damaged item or within the first couple rides .but for the most part , when you buy a quality bike , very , very few problems .
how often should you wash your wig ?it depends on the factors such as air quality and humidity .in some regions of the world , you need to wash it more often because your wig be , starts to look a little more matted or dingy before other places would .usually they say it 's about approximately every eight to twelve wears.
here we go again , just into sayunage , into this kubishime choke .i really like this .you can come here , switch and then drop them .simply just pass it to the side , one , two .if you do n't feel like dropping them , again take the thumb down , break their posture , make sure you maintain this control of this arm , and then drop them .sayunage to the kubishime , here .another way you can do this , it 's not from sayunage , but it 's an iriminage choke , is to come in this way .instead of finishing the iriminage technique , step in , plant , grab just like that .grab that hand and put the crank on their neck .from this direction , one , two , three .very painful .if you 've got multiple attackers , this may not be the best choice .as he comes to grab , parry to the side .you 've got your strikes , you 've got your strikes .one of the things i like to do from here , is from here , boom , hit him like this , then get their head up and choke them .remember i talked about the munetsuki , one of the points is that liver 14 point , right down from the nipple , out on the ribcage , that 's what i 'm going to strike into , here , boom .strike like this , then take him over .
the shower , the cartridge is in and now all we 've got to do is turn the water back on and see how it is working .now i just want to tell you that i left the valve open in the shower and the reason you want to do that is when you turn the water on , there is going to be a build up of pressure.

au lait is a home espresso machine with a steam wand , to be able to steam your milk .and since we 're steaming milk , i like to keep a wet cloth on the top of the espresso machine to wipe down the steam wand after you steam your milk .you 're going to need your cup for assembly and a milk steaming pitcher , your whole milk , and then a-all.
how to draw a cartoon bus and a cartoon truck .bus is the easiest of all for the vehicles i think .its basically just a big rectangle with rounded corners .the bottom corners can kind of be less rounded .and do n't forget the wheel wells .everytime you draw a vehicle do n't forget those wheel wells .now make this front window kind of look like that .and play around with those side windows as many as you like .you can give it a little detail here , add the fender .so it does n't look compleltely like a box with circles .and you can give it a headlight , but.
how about this ?another day , another beautiful day in northern arizona , with the grand canyon in my background .anyway , let 's talk about straight glide .another perfect opportunity to practice something when you 're getting ready for a class.
now i 'm going to show you how to do the crackle technique .it 's kind of a tricky technique .in a way it 's simple and in a way it 's not .but all you need is he crackle medium .again i 'm using the wax paper for my palette .if you put a real thin coat of crackle medium on you 'll get a real fine crackle .if you use it thick you 'll get wider cracks and a larger crackle which means larger spacing between the cracks .i 'm going to attempt to do both for you on this frame .it looks a lot like varnish .it 's also water base.

the compound patterns divides the body in half in an imaginary vertical line and , what happens part of the pattern is on the left side and the other part of the pattern is on the right side .our first pattern is the 5/4 pattern .what happens on the 5/4 pattern , we have three beats , one two three , on the left side ; and then the other two , four five , on the right side .i 'll show you how that looks .one , two , three , four , five .one , two , three , four , five .now depending on how the music is written , that can be reversed .so instead of having a three plus two pattern , you would have a two plus three pattern .so that would look like , one two three four five , one two three four five .our next one is the 6/4 pattern and , likewise , you have two sides to this .one , two , three , four , five , six .one , two , three , four , five , six .you notice how one two and three is on the left , and four , five and six on the right .one , two , three , four , five , six .one , two , three , four , five , six .finally , i will show you the 7/4 pattern .we have one two three four five six seven , one two three four five six seven .and it would go like this , one two three four five six seven , one two three four five six seven .just like the 5/4 , that can be reversed.

it 's really important now that you 've practiced your song , to make yourself a little audition check list .especially if this is your first time .this will help you when you 're nervous .so make sure you show up prepared with everything you need .on your audition checklist , you should have your song , your head shot and resume , your outfit .now i recommend bringing your outfit with you .there 's always a place to change .that way it does n't get wrinkled in the car , you do n't get it sweaty and when you 've changed , you are crisp and ready to go .you also might need to bring dance clothes and appropriate dance wear .if it 's a movement call , bring sneakers .do n't try to do a movement call in flip flops or bare feet .besides the fact that you might fall down , you 'll make the choreographer nervous because this is a recipe for disaster .you might want to bring a snack .if you 're not union , you could have a long wait ahead of you .you do n't want to wait for eight hours or six hours on an empty stomach .the other thing you want to make sure you bring are your directions .do you know where you 're going and how you 're going to get into the room ?where are you going to park ?write these things down and check them off before you load yourself into your car and.
today i 'm going to discuss interactive games to do when babysitting .interactive games can be both inside and outside .inside interactive games can be board games .make sure that if you 're doing a board game that it 's age appropriate and that the child understands the concept of the game .additional interactive games in the house may include arts and crafts , things that have the two of you interact with one another .if there is a grouping of children , more than one , you may have a couple of different activities going on at the same time .if you 're working with board games some of the children may want to play one board game , while the little ones may want to play one that 's more age appropriate .allow them all to play and give them ownership of the game .while different groups will be playing , make sure that you interact with them as well .outside interactive games may include playing tag , or even red light and green light .make sure that before you play outside interactive games that the location is safe and that you have permission to go outside .so remember , be dependable , be safe , and always be on time .
it 's something that i 've just really been quite excited about .working with tissue papers and doing collage with wax just really is a lot of fun , and what i 've liked to work with is these papers that are called [ ph ] josh papers .you would find these in an asian market , in the hardware section .they 're just wonderful , colorful papers to work with and imbed into the wax .you can use other tissue papers that you find at , really , specialty paper shops ; they also work great , and even things like angelina , which is sort of like a fancy packing material that can be imbedded into the wax , produces some interesting results .i 've even used coffee filters .that 's a coffee filter imbedded in the wax with some metallic wax on top .here 's a couple of christmas ribbons in here .and then , when we were talking about monoprinting before , i just cut long strips of paper , waxed them , and flipped them over , heated the backside to create these patterns .this is even a little piece of us postal --oh , i should n't say it --tyvek material.

musicals usually feature characters engaged in dialogue and then all of a sudden , they break into song .usually , these characters are larger than life , and also , they 're accompanied by an orchestra or a band .there are many examples of successful musicals , `` chicago , '' `` rent , '' `` wicked , '' `` cats .

he 's got c , b , a , a , b , c.so , now as a quarterback you 're dropping back , you 're trying to get the ball off.
so as you get more comfortable in the feet , the stability of that leg , that supports the kicking leg , the balance , we can add a little more height .so let 's take it middle high .using the hands to support the feet , finding your middle , your high .`` pah '' !kick , kick , step back , switch .a little moment of hesitation , before you kick , cause you 're sneaking up.
so at this point you want to get your scoring rib ready.
alright .so now you have a lot of tricks together and your arsenal of four ball tricks , it 's time to come up with a four ball routine .well , it 's kind of like coming up with a three ball routine in a sense that you need a beginning , a middle and an end .the difference however is you can seamlessly go into a four ball routine from a three ball routine using the toe stall that i talked about the pickup , you can have three , you can be do.
this flavor is cherry ginger and when we get to the bottling process i will talk more how the flavors are made .i 'm going to pour out little samples for everyone here while i talk about some of the health benefits of kombucha .the biggest health benefit i believe from kombucha is the fact that it helps alkaline the blood .now what is that ?the ph of our blood is determined by the types of food that we eat meat , dairy products , and other things contribute to acidic blood stream .a acidic blood stream is a magnet for sickness.
hi , i 'm emily larew and we 're going to look at hip hop lunges crossing back with a turn .so continuing on , our feet are together.
hi , my name is madeline franco and we 're here to talk about birds , specifically we 're here to talk about adopting a bird .this here is molly , she 's a bare-eyes cockatoo , she is an adopted bird .she was previously loved and they taught her how to say something like `` hello molly '' ,but i 'm not sure what that is .if you are considering having a parrot , you might want to consider adopting one .there are many fine adoption situations available and very many people involved in finding homes for birds .it 's called re-homing birds .i belong to the wasatch avian education society which is located in utah , and i 'm also the president of the southern nevada parrot education rescue and re-homing society .responsible pet rescues , including parrot rescues , will arrange for there to be a health check on the birds that they try to adopt out and very often they 'll put them in foster homes as a first step which helps the bird re-socialize and enables you to get a reasonably tame , well adjusted bird .molly , here , has adjusted really well to being a member of a new flock.
hey there .we are talking about types of persuasion that you might be looking at as you write your great persuasive speech .next we 're going to take a look at questions of policy .now , this is one that you might want to play with , you might not want to play with .value might be a little more exciting for you , but when we talk about a speech , a persuasive speech , dealing with question of policy , what we 're looking at is what should be done .okay , it has to do with laws and things in existence.
so we want to talk about draws that you almost always have to fold and basically i 've only put out one example.
so i already have my hair sectioned off into the back sections .what i 'm going to do is come up.
hi , i 'm natanya nielsen from saratoga springs , utah .we 're talking about crochet basics .today we 're going to talk about the double crochet .to make a double crochet in your project at the point where you 're ready to turn your row , you will chain three .this chain three , as you turn your project , becomes your first double crochet for that row .if you 'll notice , you have a hole right here , from your previous row of stitches .that 's where your hook will go in .the first thing you do is wrap your yarn around your hook .then with two loops on your hook , you will run your hook through the hole that you created , and pull up another loop , and pull it through the first loop on your hook .then you will wrap your yarn around , come through the first two loops , wrap your yarn again , and come through the last two loops .we 're going to do that one more time .you 're going to wrap your yarn around.
first off interval training is where we go out to a full sprint , try to get up to a maximum heart rate and run until we ca n't really push ourselves any more and then have a full recovery .interval training is where we physically exert ourself for a specific amount of time and then recover for that same amount of time .so let 's just use for example say we are running , we want to increase our speed or our pace especially for a 5 k or a 10 k or a marathon or something like that where we run full out for let 's say ten minutes .then we are going to drop back almost to a walk or a fast walk and recover for ten minutes.
so basically with that , their immune system , what happens is if they have the peanuts they 're allergic to , the egg that they 're allergic to , wheat , milk , soy , whatever that allergen happens to be , their immune system gets all riled up and what happens is all this histamine gets actually flooded into the body and that 's where you get those other reactions ; the hives , eczema , or the mucusy problems or any of those other issues , the stomach issues .and basically , all that does it actually makes an exhaust in your child 's adrenal glands and their immune system .and basically all they can do , is later on in life , they may have seemingly unrelated health issues because of this little small , little thing like wheat , eggs , peanuts , soy , milk or anything like that .and you do n't want that to happen .you want to make sure that they are ultimate health , and if they are allergic to these foods , not only is their immune system flooding their body and stressing all their organs out , but they 're actually not even absorbing the nutrients from these nice , healthful things .so if they 're not , if they 're actually allergic to these foods , it 's not going to be healthy for them .so either alleviate them or you can do other things to help them out .
hi , i 'm angela martindale and.
so , now we 're in my bedroom , and the first thing that we want to look for , like we have in every room , is things , are things that i do n't need , that i do n't want , that are broken , that i want to give away .and , some kind of key places to look in the bedroom , for those kinds of things , are the bed side , bed side table , where random things tend to collect .and , the desk , if you have a desk in your room .this kind of serves as my desk .any closets or cabinets that you might have in your room .shelves , these kinds of places .you 're going to want to look for things that you do n't need , you do n't want any more , are broken .so , for instance , i might , i 've actually already done this .but , i 've gone through my journals , gone through these blank books , and some of them , that i 'd just kept notes in , that i did n't need any more .i 've thrown those away.
first place , nine out of ten times , you signed a financial affidavit with your divorce attorney , at the time of divorce , so many circumstances vary with this one , and depending on your jurisdiction within your divorce , what state you 're in , and what county .the other thing also depends on the benefits administrator .you might want to check with them , in terms , of if you can assign a 401k to someone else , or not .the other thing is , that also you may be able to work out a trade , where in lieu of breaking up your 401k , you may be able to give some other asset , so that you can keep your retirement plan intact .these are all things that should be discussed with your attorney , and they should also be certainly in line , with what 's happening in your jurisdiction .most people have other assets , if they have a 401k , so you should be able to work some kind of barter out , if possible .with that in mind , i would like to say good luck to you , and please always consult your attorney , on these matters .thank you , and have a great day .dr.
in this clip i 'm going to show you how to make a pony tail .we have nice , pretty hair here .we 're going to go ahead and brush it and make it nice and soft and easy to manage when we do the pony tail .now , depends on how you want to wear your pony tail .if you want to wear the pony tail high , you come up high like this , and it 's really great for the young people , they usually love to wear their pony tail 's high , especially young girls , high school girls , and cheerleader 's , and all that stuff .they usually wear the pony tail 's real , real high .you want to take it and brush it , make it neat .this is actually in the middle of the head .you can take it and put it in there like that , little band for the hair .you 've got yourself a medium sized cute pony tail .look how nice her hair is , it 's fluffy .you see , now that 's me.
so , you find your gap , and go ahead , come up to it , ollie regular , that way you get the feel for it and the timing , and then you can go ahead and try to switch ollie .and that 's how you switch ollie a flat gap .just remember , use those five steps , good flip position , pop , slide your foot , suck up , and land on the bolts .
and , we want to continue to whisk and make it a very nice and smooth consistency .and , with the ganache as most ganache recipes.
well there are several reasons , but the most important one is it 's just plain cool .the second one is , if you look behind me , the guitars you see on the wall .to build or to buy a comparable guitar would probably cost you anywhere between $ 3 ,000 to $ 5 ,000 .if you were to build one of the guitars that you see on the wall behind me , you can probably build it for somewhere around $ 700 .that 's a really big difference .one of the most important things about building your own guitar is that you can not only choose what type of guitar you build , but you can choose what sort of scale it has , how it plays , whether it 's electric .you can choose the pickups , the electronic layout , the actual size of the guitar and , even more importantly , you can contour neck to fit your hand , to be exactly the way you want to make your playing as easy as possible .ideally what you want to do when you build your own guitar , and one of the most important reasons for building your own guitar , is to make an instrument that removes any impediment to you being able to play the best that you can possibly play .a good guitar can make a bad player good ; a great guitar can make a great player famous .
and then the second link has a pin on it .then i 've skipped a link and i 've got the next pin .i 've got seven pins across on the chain .so , the next stage , means that we will have to attach this chain to the earring component .in order to do that , we need to very small jump rings .take the end link of the chain , we hold the jump ring with a pair of pliers.
before you can start painting its important to have your subject matter in mind .i highly recommend using a photograph .what we 're going to do is we 're take this photograph.
now we have the lydian in a g scale and what that is going to have is a raised four brought about by its corresponding major relative d where the key signature is f and c.
alright.
you have you split energy here.
hi , i 'm sarah hauer .sig hauer : and.
in this video i 'll be talking about how to build a major arpeggio .so let 's start with f.
i 'm looking for an l shape right here .once i have those two things , i am going to fold my binding back so that this folded edge right here lines up with the raw edge right here .and these three raw edges , one , two , three are all together .once i have that , i am going to insert one more pin right here .i 'm going to make sure that these two folds right here are lined up .i 'm going to fold this down , and this folded edge is now lining up with this raw edge here .i 'm going to take an awl , and i 'm going to feel right here .and by the way , this is a very necessary tool .i 'm going to stitch down until i can feel that fold right underneath there , and then i 'm going to hit reverse on my machine and do just one or two reverse stitches .and then , i 'm going to bring my needle to the highest position so that my thread will move.
alvin dedeux :so the next thing you want to do is actually start attaching some of these materials to the hook .and what i 've done is i 've clipped off my materials so that the front end is nice and even .this part is going to be hanging back.
so now we 've got all these snips on the inside of the pillow to make it lay nice and neat.
next you want to check that your lever cap screw and components are tight also .if they are a little bit loose , it would cause the shatter or the jumping of your plane .my next problem is that the wood shavings keep getting clogged up in the mouth of the plane .to fix this problem you would want to take apart your plane and take a look where the frog sits in relation to the throat .now it looks like it is sitting just a little bit to far forward.
and then just smash it like that .all of those huse will come right out of there.
we 're going to now incorporate the mambo cha cha .mambo cha cha comes form our latin dances and it looks like ; 1 , 2 , 1 , 2 , 3.it has a rhythm change in it , quick little step to change your lead foot .transferring that to the step , i might start with a basic step .then i 'll say change that to a mambo cha cha .actually , we 'll do mambo cha cha on the floor where we cross , cha cha , cross , cha cha .you can transfer it to the bench .1 , 2 , 3.you can do it straight on .mambo cha cha , or you add more rhythm by doing one mambo and 3 cha chas .it 'll be mambo , cha cha , cha cha , cha cha , which changes your lead foot .once you have it place , you can start to travel around the bench .you have mambo , cha cha , cha cha , and mambo .
alright .it 's not crucial that we center this entire piece of clay , but mentally if it 's somewhat centered your pieces are going to come out a lot nicer .it 's just how it works .if you 've got something all catawampus over here.
this is a commercial break for negative space .in calligraphy we have to pay a lot of attention to negative space and we actually have to see negative space as positive space .we call our negative spaces counters .here is my favorite example of a perfectly wonderful negative space .it 's the fedex logo .do you see the arrow ?do you see it now ?do you see it now ?do you see it now ?because this arrow is a thing or shape that we recognize it 's a positive space .now , when we do letters we do letters with the idea that what we 're drawing are the counters or the negative spaces .therefore i 'm drawing the inside of the bowl of the r.
now you 'll want to decide what type of album you 're going to make .will this be an album of original material , songs that you 've written ?will it be an album of songs that you 've co-written with other people , either band members or friends or people that you would write music with ?or will this be an album of covers , songs that other people have written ?or it can be mix and match .you can have some of all three of those possibilities .now if you 're going to make a cover album , you 're going to need to pay royalties to the people that wrote the song .so you 'll need to make sure that that 's a part of your budget when you 're figuring out how much money you 're going to spend on this project .now especially if you sell a lot of albums or if it 's on radio , you 'll be having to pay royalties each time those songs are performed or aired .now if it 's original material , these will be your songs so you wo n't have to worry about that so much .but there is , obviously , more work involved as far as writing your own songs .so you might want to decide what type of music you 're going to put on the disc , and whether they 'll be original or cover tunes .
normally , i do n't go without makeup .but , i tell you , skin care is such a near and dear subject to my heart that i figured , you know what ?i might as well go bare , and i 'm happy with it .now let 's discuss the difference between my skin , which is female skin , and male skin .now boys and girls differ on different levels .of course , female skin is a little bit different because of our hormones .so , we have a tendency to break out a little bit more , we have a tendency to have a little bit more inflammation .but , on the other side , men tend to have a little bit more sun damage .why ?because they forget to put their sun screen on because it does n't make them feel manly of something .or , they just have other things to do.
hi , i 'm masequa myers and we will talk about the sixth day of kwanzaa and the sixth principle of kwanzaa .kuumba .creativity .as the lighter of the candle , i will say , `` kuumba .
let 's play our a , b harmonic minor scale once again .( demo )now , let 's go over our 6th scale degree , which is g natural .between f sharp , our 5th scale degree and g natural is a half step .it 's played with the third finger on the d string .
hi , i 'm sundae with natural sundae , and i 'm going to show you a way to massage away a stiff neck .i 'm going to give you two of my special moves .now the first thing i like to do , is i like to place a hot pack on the neck of the client , because it 's a really nice way to relax the tissue , and honestly , it makes my job easier .so the hot packs been on a couple minutes .i 'm going to remove it .what i 'm going to do is i 'm just going to start with some nice , relaxing moves .pushing the shoulders down and relaxing them .you 're going to just push them down , you can do this together , or in alternate movements .going over the shoulders and back up to the neck .one more time , down the shoulders and up the neck .now , one of the moves i have is kind of funny ...it's.
the saxophone is a big instrument .the alto sax , there are bigger saxophones , the tenor sax is bigger , but you have got a lot of ground to cover when you are playing the saxophone as far as getting your wind though the horn .it is something that does n't come to you right off the bat .you have to practice , just like , just like anything .it is kind of like lifting weights .when you start out , you are really going to feel it after a while playing the sax .it will make you tired .so breath control and strength of your lungs is real important .it is something that you can build up .do not get frustrated .as you can see , the saxophone is covered with these holes .when you are playing a higher note ( the higher the notes )the fewer holes that are covered .so if i 'm playing , for example , a high b ; the air only has to go down to the b key before it comes out of the saxophone .and that is where the sound is created .it is right where the bottom key that you are holding down is actually down .so as i go all the way down the saxophone , down to the bottom keys .this low b flat , which is the lowest note the saxophone , can play .you are going to really have to blow to get down there .it is important to fill the saxophone up .the breath control part comes in where you are not actually playing very loud , but you are playing strong .you have to push the air all the way down through the saxophone without blowing everybody 's ears out in the room .so here is a little example of how much wind you have to put through to get down that low .it takes a lot of wind .try not to blow everybody 's ears out , obviously , when you get down that low .it just takes practice , do not get frustrated .it will make you tired .pick it back up again and just keep at it .your lungs will get strong over time .
and you have a ball band inside .it actually spins right around when you flick it .and this is what the string actually goes around .so when you put your string on like i showed you in the last segment , it actually goes right around the band like so .so when you are playing with a yo-yo , it is actually spinning around the band itself which creates less friction and allows them to spin as long as they are spinning .so we will put these back together .what happens is you will notice when you are playing with it and trying to wind it back up , because there is a ball bearing here , when you move this it is not grabbing onto anything .it just continues to move around .what you need to do is actually put one finger into the gap , go around that finger once , come underneath it and skip it .do this two , sometimes three times .my ears are a little wider.
so the best thing to start with is just a measurement of the doll .she is 18 inches long.
as you continue to relax , close your eyes , focus on your hands .how do they feel ?are they cool ?are they warm ?take another deep breath in , hold it and let it out , relax .on our next segment we will begin visualizing warming our hands .

now , the way we do the functional training is to put ourselves , put our bodies into situations that more , again , accurately reflect the activities that we 're going to be pursuing .the type of equipment that i have here that we use is the kinesis system from technogym , and it allows freedom of movement .it allows me to define the movement so that i can create exercises that will prepare people for particular activities .one -- some of the things that it helps with are better balance , more flexibility , muscular endurance , strength , and just general coordination , because it integrates muscle groups rather than isolating them , as i was talking about before .it makes the muscle groups work together as they do in everyday life .balance is one -- is of critical importance for us all.
you want to decide whether you have a high , medium , or low light situation .you need to choose a location in your office or home where you need plant , you need to determine whether it is high , low , or medium light .is it close to a north , an east , a south , or a west facing window .or if you have any internal lighting , such as florescent lighting that may or may not help your situation .if you are in the north or east facing light , you might find that it would be considered a low to medium light area .and you need to choose your plants accordingly .now if your , for lack of a better example , it want to move around real quick .facing south as in our store here , you would be in a high light situation .you want to make sure that you choose a plant or find somebody to help you choose a plant that would be referred to as a high light plant .just real quick , i can show you our , such as ficus trees , a very general plant .high light plants .you want to make sure that if you choose a tree like this and you want it to look good , as it does now , then you put in the correct lighting .it is a high light plant .you want to make sure it 's in a high light situation , such as in a high light facing window .on the alternative , if you have none of that kind of light or your in a north or east facing light .you want to make sure you 're choosing plants that are low light oriented .make sure for one ; you 're talking to somebody who knows .but you 're also looking at plants that are either labeled if you do n't know as a low or medium light plant .again getting back to adenomas and other plants such as cast irons and snake plants here showing behind the screen .these will help you find that , well they 're not going to help you find , but you 're going to find that there.
hi , my name is derek tarnow .i 've been playing guitar for twelve years , and i teach and perform .in this segment i 'm going to discuss basic guitar chords .first , we have to define what a basic guitar chord is .i tend to think of them as being easy , something you teach a , like , a complete beginner in maybe the first or second lesson .and , something that 's relatively common .so , the most basic guitar chords are like three string chords .which is generally what you 'd start a very young beginner on .like an elementary age student , a late elementary age student , to like , maybe a young girl , middle school student .depending on just how their , their muscles develop .because a lot of times if you 're , like a younger student.
ok.the drink we 're about to make is called a furlong too late .evidently someone was racing horses and did n't quite make it.
you are already in an apartment lease and when you come home from work one night you notice there 's a huge hole in the ceiling and the hole is larger.
now we 're going to prep our board for our hand mirror .i 've had it cut with a jigsaw into the pattern that we made .and you want to decide which side is going to be the front of your mirror .and which is going to be the back .and on the back we want to round the sharp edges all around .so you take your eighty grit sand paper and we 'll fold it just to make it a little bit stiffer to work with and go all the way around the project in between the fingers and just round off the edge .only on the back of the project .go all the way around and then you 'll want to finish sand it with the one eighty grit paper to make it smooth .this side , the back side is going to be the painted side of this project .and the front side will be the mosaic side .okay.
so a transition from a side kick with left heel into jaded maiden works shells .so the left foot retracts slightly and then comes out as right hand comes underneath the left .weight transfers from the right to left .bringing the left toe in , the hands turn over withdraw the right leg back into a left empty stance .hands circle outwards , pulling up at the right knee .you actually jump up into the air and turn the hands over .again , hands picking up , palms facing up , shifting on the left foot .drawing the right hip in , kicking with the right foot .now , jumping forward on to the right heel , land , leap forward with left , and right hand drawing back left hand draws forward .
sometimes , again , there 's different ways that you can actually fix something .if the mistake is really , really blatant , and you just ca n't live with it , and it 's kind of off to the side , you can always do what i 've done here with this piece .there was another part , and i just cropped the image , and turned it into a different image from when it started .but the mistake was gone , and it does n't irritate me nearly as much when i look at it now as it did before .and now i can go on and finish this piece , and i will be happy with it .we talked earlier about the gold and silver leaf ...excellent for covering errors .i ...
in this segment we 're going to cover rotating the engine 180 degrees and that takes us from cylinder number one to top dead center on cylinder number three .so i 'm going to insert my extension and ratchet and just slowly just rotated the engine over a 180 degrees and remembering or keeping in mind .that the crank shaft turns at twice the rate of the cam shaft .so if i 'm rotating a cam shaft a 180 degrees.
some of the key features are the things that you should be looking for when buying an innerspring mattress is is to make sure you 're getting the state of the art coil system .the state of art coil system in my opinion is the individually wrap coil , and you can see that right here .it 's pocketed design .each coil is pocketed individually .and so it 's hinged , or tied together , in the middle so that the coil system 's able to contour a lot better .and how that benefits.
when tacking up the horse , we 'll begin by putting the saddle pad on .then we 'll take the back pad , put that on .then the saddle and we 're attaching the girth .once the saddle 's on , move on to the bridle .and we 're going to first put the reins over the horse 's head .take the halter off .bring the bit up and in and bring it over the ears .and then we 're going to attach the nose band and this should be snug.
but the next thing we need to do is take care of the bottom edges .the bottom has not yet been hemmed so we would take care of that now .by turning over just a small amount from the bottom .turning up about a 1/4 of inch and then rolling up another 1/4 of a inch and making a shirt tail hem .i would start at the seam and sew just along the edge .we could have put a contrasting piece of fabric along the bottom .we could of closed this with a zipper , it could be closed with velcro .but with velcro my concern is stagging some of the garments that would be going inside the garment bag .so i prefer to just close it with just a ribboned tied at the bottom as much with decoration with anything else .i would continue hemming the bottom edges and then we would sew on the the trim .that would be our last step in our garment bag .
if you take your arms out right here , and you just push back , you 're going to stretch through your biceps .now , i 'm feeling this a little bit .if you really want to feel a bicep stretch , do it after you work biceps hard , when you pump blood into the muscles .you 'll really feel it .okay .very simple , also here , notice from the side and from here .this is also going to stretch through your forearms as well underneath , but , it 's also a bicep stretch ,okay .really simple .tricep , which is the back of your arm , you 've seen this ,when i 'm.
hi , i 'm jan kain and the last in our chi gong series has to do with re-balancing energy .so , just as we did before we began our practice with warm up and grounding and breathing , we 're going to finish with re-balancing energy .this can be done at the end of your practice or also anytime as a stand alone exercise if you 'd like to cultivate some energy and some relaxation .so here 's how we 're going to do that .you can also do this standing or sitting , does n't really matter too much .if you 're standing your knees are soft , your abs are tight , just like we 've done throughout the series .females are going to go ahead and place the left hand over the right , and the gentlemen are going to go ahead and place right over left .this is what we call the dan tien and the chinese.
do you have some of these in your house ?it 's a shame for them to go to waste because they 're so handy ,just the right shape to put a little present inside , like a little lipstick.

with this exercise you are working the lats in the back , which also attach around into the front of the shoulder .so we 're going to emulate this without equipment , so you 're applying resistance with your partner .so your partner will start with their elbows pointed up towards the ceiling and you 're going to have your hands back here on the meaty part of the arm in the tricep area , so you 're below the elbow joint .and then your partner is going to try as you 're pulling towards you , your partner is going to resist away from you towards the mat with her arms .pull down as far as you can until you feel the back muscles kick in .now it 's hard to see a little bit because she 's lying on her back .but she 's actually using this part of her body , and resist down , to initiate that movement and resist against me pulling away in the opposite direction and down .this is a great way to get started if you do n't have equipment , it builds integrity into the shoulder as well .and resist down .you 'll want to work eight to ten reps starting out and then add on ten to twelve from there and three sets for the lats and shoulders .

i 'd like to show you one of my exercises that is my most favorite for reducing the size of your thighs .first and foremost , we 're going to start off with just a yoga ball .this is what we call a walking lunge .we 're going to start with that left .bring them together .then we 're going to switch to that right .we 're placing all the importance on our heels .so this is perfect just to start off with .this is going to help you find your balance .then i like to bump up to medicine ball .this weighs about thirteen pounds .we 're going to do the same exact .we 're keeping those abs in .all the importance is on the thighs .back and front .deep breath in , blow them out .deep breath in , blow them out .so once you 've mastered the medicine ball , we 're going to go ahead and jump to some weights .these are fifteen pounds each .this is a heavy load .this is something i like to do .same exact thing .left , bringing that knee just above .together .right .together .so that is the walking lunge .lunges are great .they happen to be one of my favorites .there 's many many exercises that you can do .but what i would like to say , when it comes to legs , they 're going to be very resistant .we walk on our legs everyday .so what you 're going to have to do is go heavy or go home .
what 's that all about ?well what we 're doing here is the first measure is bimbe .the second measure 's a combined bimbe and calypso as instead of playing the bass drum on beat one anywhere in this exercise , we 're not .because we 're using the bimbe , which is just on the and of two .the difference is in what we do with the left hand .so both times we do have the double click just after beat one .but the first time we surround the second quarter note on the hi hat like .and on the second time through where we play the calypso directly on beat four .

verbena , a good prostrate looking flowering plant .now you can see this plant could be used in hanging baskets .it could also be used in an area near walkways , where you want something that 's kind of spilling over into the landscape .often we talk ; with flowering plants , and you talk about maybe a specimen , but do n't forget plants like this that tend to spill because these often can be used in different containers where you want something to kind of give you that prostrate look .verbenas will flower about ten months a year , so they 're an excellent plant in an area where it 's frost free , so i 'd plant em ' after the last chance of frost is there , and this plant will last until next fall or early winter .if you 're really a a stouthearted person , you may want to bring it in , and see if you ca n't overwinter it in a protected site .verbena needs good sunlight ; about six hours of sun a day , and make sure that you water it on a regular basis .if it gets too dry it 'll stop flowering , so make sure that you 're watering probably every second or third day .verbena is an excellent landscape plant .for on gardening , i 'm stan de freitas , mr.

now we 're going to look at the two sides of footwear in the 60 's .the main appearance that was new was the appearance of boots .especially boots as wear for women .previously boots had only been worn by men , maybe in the working environment .women really did n't wear them .they wore evening shoes .and so the mods popularized a mid-calf or knee-high boot .i 'm wearing an example right now .now , these you can see a few things , one , there 's a very high heel .you either wanted the heel to be really high.
we have different colors and we are going to coordinate them on each side .i have 4 pictures that i have got for free actually.

now we 're going to show you a technique from the inside position of the body where you 're actually going to take and step out of the way .as you 're doing , sort of like what we did in previous clip , pushing down the head , pulling up on the arm .but instead of twisting the person in front of you , you 're actually going to be taking your right or left leg and stepping out of the way and allowing the person to actually move through .this can also be done if someone is charging at you , trying to shoot in to grab your legs.

okay now i 'm going to give you my thousand dollar tip .i 'm probably going to lose a lot of money over this tip .but this is going to help you tremendously .whenever you get into an injury , for example you 're out pulling weeds in the back yard and you hurt your low back .you pick up a heavy box and you hurt your low back.
alright , now that we 're working with really wet clay , this is a good thing to do here .get down on it .and you probably ca n't see what i 'm doing .i 'll do it from this angle .get on there and just fold this in there like that .alright ?you can do some finger mush , just hold the rim of your pot , do n't worry about tweaking it out , obviously ,since we 've abused it so much .but pull it in there like that .we can go back there can clean that up .what we want to do , i like this.
so we finished the tile mosaic .here it is , the product before grouting .i 've waited twenty four hours for the glue to dry fully , and now we 're down here in my grouting studio , which is a place i do n't mind getting messy .and it 's something that you want to think about because grouting is a very messy process .i 've also changed into clothes that i do n't really care about just in case grout gets on me , which usually does happen .we 're ready to go .i 've put on gloves to protect my hands during the grouting process .you also want to make sure that you wear a dust mask while you mix dry grout .once it 's mixed , you can take the mask off .what you 're going to do is take the grout ,in this case i 've chosen a nice , soft yellow , which goes beautifully with our project and you 're going to mix it slowly with some water .mix the water in very slowly because if you mix too much water in , then you 're going to have to add more grout.
with the wheel going at a fast rate of speed and wetting our hands ; we 're going to use our right hand pushing down , left hand pushing in towards the center and compress that rod shape back into itself .the more speed you have on the wheel at this stage the greater the control that you will have and slowly releasing the pressure.
it is called a saddle bag and.
alright , so now that we got it almost there .i 'm going to do one last pull.
so , let 's talk about a four player game .we 're going to give each player seven bones .i 'll go ahead and take my seven .now you take your seven .hope you have a good hand .and now we 'll divvy up the rest .then we 'll start playing .now , what do you notice ?no bone yard right ?double six always leads , i played the double six and then play travels around to the left .so , does this player have any sixes ?yes , right there .do you have a six or a five ?you have a five .and how about this player ?this player now needs a six or a three .there 's a three , plays it there .now , i need to play a six or a four .i can do so , but what if i could n't ?what if i look at all my bones and i do n't have one with a six or a four on one of the sides ?well , there 's no bone yard.
surgical forceps are used to carefully isolate your lashes to apply the extensions .novalash bond adhesive is used to then bond the lashes in place .as a customer , you will lay down on a massage table with your eyes closed .you may listen to music or just fall asleep .you will not feel a thing because these lashes are not touching your skin .you will only feel the faint touch of my fingertips and the forceps through your lashes .you will not feel any pain during this procedure .

and i showed you how to do it with pinto beans .well this is basically what they would look like with black beans .by morning 8 hours later after you soaked them for any 8 hour period that you soak them they would start to grow .when they have got bigger like this then this is my other secret to saving a lot of money i really like these slow cookers .this is 2 different types of slow cookers , a crock pot is actually a brand name but the name of what these are really.
ok , now we are going to learn how to play the right hand chorus of `` jingle bells .
today i 'm going to be discussing fielding and more specifically the fielding percentage statistic .it 's really the only statistic that is common amongst defensive players .and the way that you calculate the fielding percentage is your assist plus your put outs .now what 's an assist ?assist is you can pick up as the beginning of an out being made .so it 's the shortstop fielding the ball .what 's the put out ?it 's the first basement catching the ball , so.
hi .again , we 're talking about some of the tools and some of the materials that you 're going to be using for your copper foiling project .one thing that i would recommend is what 's called a copper foil dispenser .reason being is.
one other little detail cut that we need to make before we can begin sanding on this is at the very top .the piece of wood that i started with had a fairly rough band saw cut on the top edge .and you 'll notice as i rotate this around.
i think that the idea is to dress for the weather .recognize that in many birding situations weather , obviously , can be less than optimum .certainly in tropical situations where rain is an issue , it 's always handy to have a light poncho or even a small portable umbrella that you can pop up during tropical rain showers .if you 're birding on the water , dress in layers with a windbreaker and a sweat shirt or something underneath .in the winter , obviously , it 's very critical to dress warmly with appropriate winter clothing .and these days , so many sports stores and so forth have all manner of outdoor gear and wear .foot wear is especially critical .for many situations in the summer , sandals are just fine if you 're going to be birding by the seashore .at the same time , if you 're going to be hiking in rugged areas , lightweight hiking gear or hiking boots of various sorts .in many cases , it can be wet underfoot , and in some cases , particularly in the early spring or in situations where you 're in marshy areas , actually having boots .and , i have here a pair of what are called `` wellies '' or wellington boots .these are basically just rubber boots .and , they are very effective in that they just slip on .and , you can then not be as concerned where you have to walk .there are boots now that can be pulled on over hiking shoes or sneakers , that if you throw them in a backpack , you can very quickly transition from , you know , sort of dry land to aquatic situations .so , just be practical in your packing .do n't think fashion first .think in terms of , of what 's going to be most appropriate for the environment that you 're in and , what 's going to be most , or least.
the most important part of shooting is getting down the mechanics .in showing you the mechanics , i first want to show you , ?feet placement '' .so when you are placing your feet and you are trying to learn the mechanics to shooting , you want you feet shoulder width apart .balance , so you can be balanced , so that if any defensive man comes in and tries to move you while you are trying to shoot they can not , because you have a firm plant , a firm foundation .next , you want to make sure that you grab the ball so that the lines are horizontal to your body , sometimes you do not always have that option , sometimes when you catch the ball , someone throws it to you crazy , you might have to catch it.
so this is a scale that has over tones of many diverse cultures .in a jazz sense it can be used over the chord that i just mentioned , minor 7 flat 5.
hi , it 's dowell at the firehouse detail shop.
and this is perfect to practice with .this is what your palm is going to look like , your going to take your bo and put it above your head and spin it on your palm , just like that , it 's going to rotate .ok now the escrima is good practice , just so you can get the feel of it , get the feel of balance , ok you just want to learn how to do all that and keep it moving around and spin .you want to build momentum , good .so once you get that down , go ahead and pick up you r bo , this is a really cool move you are going to do , you can go from helicopter spin one , through your fingers and come back across two , and palm spin all above the head .so one more time from here , one , two and palm spin above the head .alright so now this is how we are going to go through it .you are going to have it on this side ,ok , take your two fingers over here , go through the fingers , helicopter spin go switch sides , i do that do build up momentum and pull all the way back .alright do it , you are going to take the bo and do it and put your hand as flat as possible right above your head ,ok if it 's tilted in any direction , your bo is going to fall off .so from here you are going to go up and spin the bo all around in a circle and catch it between your thumb and your first finger and bring it down .alright so again one , two back across.
so people ask me what is the key to a successful hoophouse and.
i would take black polish or white , any polish .i would put it on a hard surface.
alright , this is a game called disgruntled groom , and it 's really funny because if you play it with a whole group of girls at a bachelorette party , you 'll be amazed at how many things that they do that they 're not supposed to .first , you want to make a list of rules .make a list of things that a disgruntled groom would never complain about .he would never say that this outfit makes him look fat , he would never complain about a broken nail , that he 's bloated , he has bad skin , that he needs to get his roots done .he needs to get his nails done .all of these things that a groom would never say .also , things he would never do .he would never cross his legs .so if you cross your legs at the knees and the ankles , that 's something a groom would never do .make a whole list of these things and give each attendee of the bachelorette party a strand of beads .every time they do something that 's on this list , you can take one of their beads .every attendee is going to get a list of all the rules , of all the things a disgruntled groom would never do or say , so that they know that if a girl says , `` oh my gosh , i broke a nail '' , they 're going to steal her beads .at the end of the night , the girl who has the most beads is going to win a prize , and she also gets to keep all the great mardi gras beads.
a good way to do this is get a little bit on your spoon .just let it drip back and forth .you can get a little artsy with this .we do n't want too much chocolate .just enough .at this point , like the sugar , we do n't want them all looking exactly the same .it 's something your kids can do .a little bit of sugar and a little bit of the chocolate on top of each one .just gives it a nice little texture when you 're eating it .there you go .these are our cookies , and enjoy !

how much does a personal trainer cost ?well , this depends .it depends on your location .it depends on who your personal trainer is .it depends on the facility that you 're at , and it also depends on if your personal trainer is coming to where you are at -- so an at home personal trainer .if you 're going to have somebody come to your house and train you , this is going to be a little bit more costly .if you 're going to go to a gym and have a personal trainer train you , this is probably going to be a little bit more cheaper than having someone come to your home , because you 're going to the facility to get trained .it also depends on the trainer .are you looking for a specific type of training ?are you looking for just overall training ?are you looking for someone that has extensive background and has a degree ?are you looking for someone that has a certification ?well , if the person has a certification and a degree , and also has a lot of experience , they 're going to cost more than somebody that does n't have any three of these things .so , for example , let 's say that you were living in a large city .if you 're living in a large city , the personal training cost is going to be up a little.
this segment is on long drives and there are three basic power sources in the swing , the hands , the arms and the body .and when you could use all three together in coordination , and use all three at their maximum in coordination , for example , i could use my hands.
s a really good place to get good , accurate registration .we 've got a couple test pieces here .the way you use a biscuit joiner is you 're connecting two pieces .we 're going to connect these perpendicular to one another because we 're going to have a box that 's going to be connected like that on all sides .so what you 're going to want to do.

to start off , we 're going to need 1 cup of shortening .we have our half cup measuring cup here .we 're going to go ahead and dump this .make sure to get all of it .we 're going to need one more half cup .same thing .we 're going to measure it off and pour it right in there .put the shortening to the side .now we 're going to need 2 teaspoons of vanilla .1 and 2.at this point , we start it on low and just mix it in .turn it up step by step .at this point , we 're going to go ahead and scrape it from the sides and turn it back on .
now listen , eyelashes are all the rage , and everybody is wearing them .so , whether you do them at home or you go to a professional , eyelashes are sure to give your eye that great big bang you need when you 're goin ' out .so , first things first ; you got to have your essentials .you want to make sure you have your eyelashes , and these come in all different types of sizes .you can get long , medium , short .use whatever is best for your eye .you want to make sure and have your eyelash glue .and this is a water , a waterproof product that you can use , so you do n't have to worry about tearing up , or water getting in your face and your eyelashes coming off .you also want to make sure and have a good pair of tweezers .these are essential when applying your eyelashes .so , the first thing you want to do is analyze the eye , and go ahead and take one of the eyelashes off your tray .dip it into the glue like so , and then , you simply attach it to the base of the lash like so , very easy to do .now , if you 're doing this on yourself you want to make sure and have a steady hand .you want to make sure and have some products in front of you , like some water and some , maybe some antiseptic in case you do get something in your eye .but you simply take your time , apply it directly to the lash line , and you 'll let that glue dry .now again , this is something that is very easy to do , so make sure you practice at home .get some girlfriends and have a eyelash night .practice putting on eyelashes .you can use the strips , you can use the individuals , whatever is best for your eye .my name is sylvia russell , and.
now time for the last step of the smoked salmon canape -- the smoked salmon , of course .get a nice big , thick piece , and just sort of drape it on top .and it 's kind of nice the way that it gives you a little bit of height , and if you want , you can even put -- on a flatter piece i 'll show you .if you want to put less smoked salmon , here are a couple of different options you can do here .either the height , sort of casual look like that .or if you want a more flattened look , but do n't feel like it 's quite complete by itself , grab some capers which go very well with smoked salmon .garnish with a few of those , that 's another option .get a couple more .do you want to get some close-up stuff ?do a row of taller ones , and just cut the salmon as you need to .and for these last two we 'll do some flat pieces .a few more capers .you could also drape a long strand of red onion on top , would be really nice .i 'm going to push these down to get really cozy beside one another , because i 'm going to cut a few pieces of lemon , so those people who like a little squeeze can go ahead and do so .you do n't want to squeeze it right away on top of the salmon because it will actually start to change the color of it -- the acidity of the lemon .just so that you keep some kind of uniform look .there you go , your platter 's done , and that 's ready to take to a table i think .
now i 'm adding six cups of water , i have already put 4 cups of water in here .i 'm going to add 2 more cups of water .now i 'm going to add 2 cups of beans .the reason why you do n't want to add to many beans compare to your 6 cups of water is because these beans are going to expand .not right away.
when you go to an outfitter to get some boots , it 's a really good idea to have them measure your feet .you might have an idea of what size you are , but it helps the person there who is going to fit you for boots or shoes , to have an idea of the dynamics of your foot ; not necessarily just the size .so they 'll use a device like this , which is called a brannock .on the brannock , they 'll have you place your foot , and then they have three measurements that they 're going to take .first measurement will be the toe to heel , measured here .they will look down and see what size your foot is , total lengthwise .they 'll also grab your toes and they 'll bend them up , and find out where the ball of your foot is .they 'll slide this to match where your toes bend , and they 'll look over here to see what size that is .they 'll take the larger of the two .sometimes , if you have really short toes , your ball-to-heel length might be longer than your toe-to-heel .the place in the shoe.
this is the part that 's.
in this segment we 're going to be talking about the miscellaneous boxing equipment , not the major stuff that you normally wound find in the gym as requirements , such as the boxing ring , and the heavy bags , and the speed bags .but , today we 're going to be dealing with a lot of the individual , miscellaneous equipment .and , we 're going to be talking about everything from the actual heavy bag gloves , used on the heavy bags , to sparring gloves .we 'll talk about the differences and why one should be used for sparring and why one should only be used on the heavy bag .we 're going to be covering the different types of head gears .there 's sparring head gears.
and again on this side ...
now i 'm going to start working a little bit more on our vase in the background which is a woven pattern of greens and browns .but if i really look at those greens and browns , the browns in some places are almost red .in some places the browns are almost gray .so let 's see if we can get some of those colors that i 'm seeing .the very , if you look at the very front of that top rim of that vase , and i 'm noticing that i can see this inside of the vase slightly which is wrong in my drawing , but.
it 's really , really , really expensive .in fact , for a gallon of canola oil , we 're running almost $ 4.25 a gallon .i do n't know about you.
okay , i put this -- in here now , we can see , more or less , what 's going on .now , you have to see the proportions.
hi , this is yolanda vanveen , from vanveenbulbs.com .and in this series , we 're learning all about how to identify our spring blooming flower bulbs .one of my favorite tulips is princess irene .it 's another two tone , that is just the most ultimately beautiful tulip in your yard .and i could just spend hours looking at them because there 's no two.
now we are going to discuss how to remove a tick from your pet .the first thing to know about removing a tick from your pet is make sure that it is a tick .there are lots of lumps and bumps on our animals sometimes that may look like a tick and actually are n't so make sure that that is what that is .they are little small insects with legs .they are generally going to be attached to the skin and be dark brown to black in color .ticks generally just attach at the head through the skin .they do have barbs on their heads.
the difference between cartoon voice over and like regular voice over like narration or commercials is that in cartoon voice overs you have to do a lot more animated takes , so you have to put a lot more character in it.
these next exercises we are going to perform are the lunges with arm combinations .now go to your pantry and grab whatever you have .you might have bottles of water in there.
another particularly useful knot around the campsite , is the timber hitch .this is usually used to bring , move timber around that you might want to use for a campfire , or if you need to build like a lean-to , or a structure of some sort .anyway , to begin tying this knot , you start just like we have with the other hitches , just by going under.it would be a log in this case , and then you take it over this way , and wrap the loop around , like so .then you just take this end , and go around several times .three or four.
now we are going to go through and walk some bebop on the bass .now the thing about bebop is you are going to be doing a lot of fast runs.
now if you really are serious about your craft and you 're not going to have a record label doing all of your booking , all of your stuff for you that needs to be handled , you 're probably going to need to find your own agent .the reason for that is , you can book yourself , but you just ca n't promote yourself very effectively .if you have somebody else doing it for you it always looks better .now there 's some things that you want to look out for in trying to find your own agent .the first thing , probably the most important thing that you want to find is somebody that you trust and that really believes in what you 're doing .if they do n't believe in what you 're doing , they 're not going to work that hard for you .if they love what you 're doing , they will go to the ends of the earth to make sure you that you are successful , because they 're invested in making you successful .now having experience in the industry is a real plus .if you can find somebody that has all sorts of connections and all sorts of ways to get you into shows that you could never get into on your own , that 's really awesome because that kind of person is going to take you over the top .now , having heard that , that kind of person 's probably also going to cost more than somebody else .having an incredible motivation and great desire can a lot of times be a substitute for having great connections .so if you can find somebody who really believes in you.
hi , my name is cristy nix with stoneblessings.com .today we 're talking about the 7 energy centers of the body , or the 7 chakras .right now we 're talking about the heart chakra , which is located in the center of your chest .and it governs physically your heart , blood circulation , as well as your lungs , and your arms and your hands .it is vibrant , vibrant grass green , very clear green .and it is represented by the 12 petal lotus , and it 's symbol , basic symbol is the hexagon .now this energy body , specifically is your heart , it is unconditional love of self and others , and deals with compassion , and how you feel about things , very much your emotional self .there 's several stones that support this body .they are rose quartz of course , which i think it 's the most common .and it is very much a warm hug , so to speak .it 's a beautiful pink color , light pink color .and i think of this chakra , since it 's green typically in most chakra demonstration , but i think of it more as watermelon tourmaline , where it 's green on the outside , and then pink on the inside ; so pink is definitely represented here .and then adventuring , which is a great green color , which very much helps in growth and nurturing , and then moss quartz , or tree moss ,i 'm sorry , tree moss agate right here , which is very much nurturing and growing things as well and very much a grounding of heart , to keeping you centered in the earth .now one wonderful thing is , by being aware of this chakra , and knowing that it is out of balance , you could be of having breathing problems , like asthma , or having , seems like emotional crisis , it 's very good to sit back and ground actually in your heart .so that everything that comes out of your heart is done in love , versus being so up in your mental body to where you actually are thinking about things , you 're wrapping your mind around things , but the things that are coming out are almost forced , and there is n't any true energy positively supporting them .so having a health and healthy heart chakra , will keep you doing all things out of love .
this exercise is called couch squats .this is a great exercise that you can do not only through the commercial breaks , but you can do it throughout the show that you 're watching on t.v .so what you 're going to do is you 're going to pretend that you 're going to be a couch potato .but not really .you 're going to really build up those legs , build up those gluts , have great looking legs , so here we go .abs in tight , arms out , and.
sometimes in dental offices , or professional stores , there are available these ...we 'll call them prefab , custom whitening trays .and what 's nice about these is that it does n't require a dental office visit to make custom trays .instead , it has soft , formable trays in there that already has the whitening gel in it .so there 's no guesswork as to how much whitening gel to put in or anything else .all it requires us to do is to take it out of the package and simply pinch it on our teeth .and by pinching it , what it will do is it will customize it and form it exactly to your bite .the nice part about this product is that the trays will actually get far back in an arch .so again , in talking about where the smile lines are , it will get far back to teeth , and it is only required to stay on your teeth for one-hour period of time .so that means that your commitment to this whitening process is not all that great .and most people can see their way through that .the biggest part about whitening is to maintain that commitment though .because many people go into whitening wanting to whiten , and then get home and find that they really did n't have that time to create or donate for it .so you want to find the best treatments that are right for you .in this case , that one hour , you take it off , you throw it away , the next day you go back.
in this clip , we 're going to re-install the back plate .i 'll just get her lined up.
here to talk about adaptive sports , and how snowshoeing can fit in with a lot of people  s adaptive life .so , going up an incline , very important to take smaller steps and keep the weight over the balls of your feet , and just , just like climbing a set of stairs but also be aware to keep that athletic stance.
in this step , we 're going to take a look at how to play the cowbell while holding it .most of the time , i would say if you have to hold something and play it with another hand , that you would hold it in your weak hand and play it with your dominant hand .so i 'd be playing this with my right hand .but that does n't feel as comfortable to me as this way , which is holding it in my right hand and playing with my left hand .now , there 's different tones on the cowbell .that 's the big , thick nice sound .then you can also have a thinner , higher pitched sound .and that 's just in between .you do n't really ever want to play on the side of the cowbell .it 's just not there .now , this yellow piece is called a ridge rider .and the reason why that is on there is because you 're supposed to play that cowbell like this , and the ridge rider protects the cowbell from bending and breaking .i do n't like it though because it restricts being able to play up here , so i flip my cowbell over .and as you can see , playing on the non -- the side without the ridge rider , has bent .but , i can hit it on the --i can , i just have more flexibility in that way .so , when you hold it , you hold it , and then you also , you hold the to where the opening is kind of out to the crowd .that 's where the sound is going to go .and you do n't need to crush it .you do n't need to play this thing as hard as you possibly can , because the sound of this carries very well .so , that is how you play the cowbell while holding it .
but little kids might not make that association.
with this exercise we 're going to show how to work the inside part of the thigh , where gravity likes to take its toll .it 's also good muscle for various sports such as skiing , anything that you 're going to use against gravity to take off with and apply force .so we 're going to extend the top leg and with one hand above and below the knee joint , this is resistance and try this without resistance first.
it 's again , a very difficult , you need a lot of strength to get this pose done , but we can use some assist from your strap .what you need to do is you 're going to belt your arms , but you want to do that just above your wrists , just above your elbows .the strap is going to support your whole body .so if you come over , lengthening , start to bend your elbows , and put all your weight on that strap is how you can get this pose done , and maintain this pose .you 're pressing through your heels , you 're lengthening out the crown of your head ; from the top of the pubis bone through the sternum , through the neck is all being drawn in .learning to breathe ; see what 's going on in your body .if you 're lucky enough to have somebody else support this pose , as she 's supporting the upper body with that strap , i can now support her lower body , and she can go ahead and straighten out her legs , drawing the stomach in .and again , my knees are soft.
in this clip we are going to be going over how to combo your fan kick .what we did today in doing our combo is you can do whatever you want after it .we are just going to go ahead and do a basic aerial .to look really good.
how to care for a gray tree frog .caring for a gray tree frog is pretty easy .you 've just got to be disciplined about it .we just have our little enclosure here , we made in our earlier video .you can see our little gray tree frog hanging out in there .basically , what you have to do , is on a daily basis , you want to check the moisture level in there .make sure it 's nice and humid for him .again , tree frogs , and frogs in general , do n't drink water .they absorb it through their skin , so that 's why we 're not worried about having a water bowl in there .what we are going to do , is on a daily basis , is just take that out , and we can mist down the bedding , so that it 's nice.
if you do n't have your own gear ; we 'll give it to you , for a price .the specific harness used at this gym is called the misty mountain jim dandy .this harness ; it 's not comfortable , but it does serve purpose .it 'll keep you on the wall .to put on this harness , you 're going to step through the leg loops that are already in place .once both legs are through , pull the harness up.
they have so much flavor and people make the mistake of running them underwater .you do n't have to do that .all you have to do is just take a wet paper towel .you do n't want to put mushroom under water .they have so much water .they actually get like water logged then break and you do n't want that .you want to keep that nice flavor .so i just take a paper towel and just wipe them down , like so .so do that to all your mushrooms .and believe me , we 're also going to use a lot of mushrooms in this one 'cause it 's great .you ca n't kill us with mushrooms .i love it .but again , if you do n't like mushrooms as much , maybe you should n't even be making this , but if you like mushrooms , definitely you want to go with as many different varieties .it gives it a lot of flavor to this beef stroganoff .all right , now that i got them all rinsed and cleaned down and wiped , let 's give them a good slice .my portabellas were already sliced , and if you can get mushrooms that are fresh and already sliced , this will make it a lot easier , but i tend to like to slice my mushrooms the length of the mushroom .so when you slice it , you 'll actually see like a mushroom piece which looks really nice , like so .so we 're going to just slice all of our mushrooms like this , even the shiitake.
hello , we 're going to be going ahead with the remains of the lower case alphabet .but before we do , i just want to touch the point that we 're going to be hitting these letters between guidelines .the guidelines are five times the height of the pens .so we 've measured out five pen widths .and we 're going to do the consonants , but here are the vowels just in case you have n't seen them , a ;e.
to prepare our wooden base before we start , you 'll want to rough it up a little .it helps the tiles adhere to the surface .so , i have here something that i made .i just put nails into a board until they stick out .this is great for really gouging up a surface that needs to be mosaicked .so you just scrape it up , just all the surfaces that you will be mosaicking .the next step to preparing our wood base for the mosaic is to coat it with a layer of white glue and water .you 'll want to mix up 4 parts water to 1 part white glue and paint that over the entire surface where it will be mosaicked .then , you 'll want to let that dry thoroughly .this will seal the wood and so the grouting wo n't dry too fast because the wood often soaks up the liquid in the grout .so this will seal it so it wo n't soak up the liquid in the grout .it gives better adhering to the tile adhesive .so , you just coat that over completely and let it dry thoroughly .
bras are bras .as much as you might want to have some innovative design it is ultimately a bra .and not that i 'm trying to make you not want to be creative with it.
a good way to get used to using a bosu ball , that prioperceptive neuromuscular facilitation , is ...
and i 've got this weird english accent , but do n't let that fool you .i know how to perform , i love performing on stage , and.
hi , i 'm ann myrick and.
in this clip we 'll speak about strategy a little bit .the three places of a triples game .the leads , the vice skips and the skips .the leads are to get their bowls , three of them , closest to the jack .the vice skip , the second person up in line , will also do that .he will try to nudge out an opponent , get closer , move the jack .but , the skips strategy is entirely different .he 's the boss of the game .he directs which way he wants you to bowl .he 'll also have to clean up any mess that his team has made .so , his strategy is if the opponents on the jack to get himself there instead , any way he can do it .
it 's something that they latched onto early on in the internet area .and they have been doing since .what they do here and.
i have taken off my chain to demonstrate the beauty of knowing how to pick up momentum from the terrain that you are presented with .people call it pumping which means that you are finding the back side , finding the transition in every aspect of the trail , and making speed with it .so chain on my bike , starting here on the slight incline.
alright the drink we 're about to make is called a rum cobbler .let 's go ahead and put some ice in a glass.

so moving onto the grapes which is our last still-life fruit .i 'm actually going to use some purple and-but i wo n't use purple straight out of the tube .and you can make purple , or you can either buy purple in a tube , or you can use blue and red and you can get purple that way as well .so we 'll see which one turns out how we want it .so i 'm just going to take this brush here.
next , let 's add a comping move before the little routine.
let 's try our folkloric shoulder drop rocking the body from side to side .let 's start with the feet.
for my purpose right now.
hi.
the first thing you want to do is prepare your home for winter.
hello , my name is scott.
and you maintain the people 's relationships that i 've mentioned before you are going to have a successful club .however , one area that is very , very important is to have safe and up-to-date equipment , exercise equipment .and over the years i 've learned that leasing the equipment , i 'm talking about weight machines and cardio equipment .the technology has not changed that much recently , but every three to five years there is new equipment that comes on and obviously competition matters in this business .i 've found that leasing the equipment is much more efficient than purchasing the equipment and waiting until it breaks .when you purchase the equipment you usually wait until it wears out and that 's usually somewhere between seven to ten years , or maybe longer .if it 's longer than that , it is outdated equipment , and then you are not competitive with the other clubs .leasing the equipment is very convenient because every three to four years.
so here we go .live , right back here .look what 's going on right now .we 've got our scallops ; that 's mine right there .this one i got ; that 's my name .it 's got meat wrapped all over it .so we just want to take these , keep our heat at a medium .you 've added a little bit of oil in there , you 're not going to have to do that much .one of the things i 've always been taught , cook with a low heat .i 'd rather cook with a low heat , get it nice and perfect .as opposed to a super , super high heat and not managing it .and that 's what we do n't want our scallops to go through today .give these a quick toss .look at that , look at that color .now while our scallops are cooking , keep these together .get those in there .keep them nice and folded , because we do n't want them breaking apart .the only reason why i did these today , this way , is because i wanted to show you as a viewer , that if you do n't have toothpicks , if you do n't have something like that available , just keep them bound together .just like that .just like that .so there 's how it is .we 're going to move on to our next step , and it 's really getting down to the final finale .we 've got the basil , redskin mash .we have the reduced seafood stock that 's going to be our citrus-sage butter reduction .then we also have the bacon and prosciutto wrapped scallops .be back for the next one .
so , this is a bead tray .you can get this at most bead shops .and it has measurements on it ,so you can see how long a necklace is going to be .for mostly custom orders , people want their necklaces a certain length .and it has little pockets in it to put all your different things , like so.
this is an improv game called freeze tag .i like to use it as a warm up.
the 3 on the left and the right.
alright , now we 're ready to move on to artifactual communication .and i know these are things that you 've thought about.
in this clip we 're going to talk to you about a , the return of serve and just some basics in the return of serve is to help you out .whatever kind of stroke you might have just the importance of moving forward and the timing.
when there is a dress code race , which is usually evident at rodeos and some nicer barrel races where there 's more money at stake , they normally require you to wear a cowboy hat .lots of different sizes , shapes , colors , that does n't matter but you do have to have a hat .most places do have a hat fine though .if you lose your hat during a run it 's usually a fine that they fine you a certain amount of money.
another part of your fly fishing equipment that a lot of people do n't think about is the backing .the backing is what goes on before you put the fly line on , so here 's the back end of my fly line and here 's the backing .that 's usually buried down inside your reel somewhere .the backing serves several purposes .one is your fly line is going to be somewhere between eighty and a hundred feet long .if you happen to hook a fish that pulls out those eighty feet of fly line , you usually will have on your reel , a hundred yards or more of backing , so the backing comes into play if you hook a big fish .now , the other thing the backing does is it increases the diameter of the arbor of the reel .since most of our fly reels are single action , that means you turn the handle around once , the spool goes around once .the backing increases the diameter of the arbor in the center .so , that allows you to pick up the line just a little bit quicker by having a larger diameter center on that reel .the other thing it does is , by increasing the diameter of the center of the reel , the arbor of the reel , it allows your fly line to be wrapped around something that 's a little larger diameter .the fly line , because it has that plastic coating , has what we call memory , so it tends to want to stay coiled , so if you wrap it around the center of the reel , which is a pretty small diameter without the backing , then your line will come off looking like an old fashioned telephone cord with lots of kinks and curls in it , so the backing adds some distance if you hook a big fish , but it also increases that diameter so that you pick up your line a little bit faster and it also keeps your fly line from being wrapped tightly around the center of the reel .
hey it 's tony naile.
perhaps your dealing with a customer.
now there 's a couple more points i want to bring up when talking about what type of container to choose , size and drainage .now , some people make the mistake of choosing a container that is too big for their plant .i say , do n't choose a container that is more than four or five inches wider than the container it 's in .if you have your plant in a six inch pot , put it into an eight or ten inch container .do n't think , oh the plant 's going to grow into this container , because the fact is , most plants do n't grow that fast ,so you can re-pot.
alright , now we 're going to learn how to do two in one hand , which is eventually going to be your first three ball trick .so two in one hand.
so like i said , we 've got all our nice round wads here and.
in this clip i am going to show you a contour on the cheek using the powder .first you want to apply the foundation and then set it with translucent powder .then i 'm going to go in with my contour color which is about a shade darker than her natural skin.
the second tool that you 'll need to bird watch is a field guide .there are many field guides out .field guides for each state , field guides for half of the country , the eastern peterson 's , the eastern fibley 's , coffman 's field guide is for the entire country .if you 're going to be traveling , maybe one for the entire country would be best .if you 're going to spend most of your time looking at birds in your home area , then a field guide for eastern united states , or western united states , if you live there , would be best , possibly .rogar tory peterson , one of the world 's most prominent birders who past away a few years ago , developed a system of field marks in the field guide , where there are actually little arrows pointing to the specific part of the bird , that helps you identify exactly what that bird is .for me , birding is a process of elimination .i see a bird , is it a grackle ?no !is it a dove ?no !i eliminate what it 's not , until i 'm sure of what it is.
we 're going to continue the cross front , but this time adding a little body pulse on each side .so you want to bring the elbows in , and let your belly too , just a little bit , so you have a little action of the pelvis from front to back .so as we cross front , rocking the tail bone , drawing the elbows in , letting your body pulse , relaxed ,easy pulse , hips from the front to the back.
what we are going to do is we are going to go on to some cardio and.
i must forsooth be forced to give my hand opposed against my heart , unto a mad brain rudesby .mad brain rudesby ?i 'm going to have to look that one up .good old shakespeare .you know shakespeare said all the world is a stage .i 'm janice creneti , director of the girlstories theater project in tampa , florida .and i 'm here to talk to you today about how to become an actress .i 've been acting for over twenty-five years myself , so i 've learned a few things along the way .well part of it depends on exactly what kind of actress you want to be .there 's film , there 's live theater and you can do straight plays , you can do musicals .there 's voice over work , and even now , acting on the internet .but no matter what kind of acting.
now i 'm going to talk to you about cleaning your lens if you own a drill mount or a rimless pair of glasses .again you 're using the microfiber cloth , but in this instance you have to be a little bit more careful because you do n't want to put any extra pressure on the point at which the lens is screwed in .so what i like to do is pretty much hold the cloth over , put a little bit of pressure on that fulcrum so that you 're not pulling on it.
what 's another great move you can add to your belly.
okay we are going into unlocking our channel lock.
hi , i 'm harvery woodyatt .i 'm owner of perfect tan here in orem , utah .we 're a fool service tanning salon .we have over twenty tanning beds as well as a spray on system .i often get asked , `` how do i avoid the bikini line tan ? ''and the best way to help you with that is if you 're tanning in doors ,most people tan in the nude .it 's a very secure environment .your rooms are locked .but , remember when tanning in the nude , you are going to be tanning parts of your body that have probably never seen the sun before .so , you have to be very careful on your exposure there .make sure you use a good indoor tanning lotion .be careful of your time .even if you feel you 're tan and your arms and your upper body.
alright .so , this our downbeat high hat lift on three .i 'm on 80 bpm .go ahead , take a listen .take a look at what 's happening with my feet and how they 're kind of working in relationship to each other and also with hands .here we go .alright , make sense .let 's go ahead and do it together .i 'll count us off .this is high hat lift on the downbeat of beat three , one , two , ready ,play .alright , make sense .mechanically , this is the same as when we did beat one .musically , it gives a very sound .practice it on your own .slow it down if you need to , and here ' the next clip .
so we 're working on the second rift from weaser 's.
so now we get a little funky on the bass here.
and i 'm going to go ahead and turn my machine on 2 minutes .from here , i 'm actually going to take my other hand and apply it directly to my client 's skin .the reason is because we need to create a complete surface , because i am conducting , i will need to also have a current going through her skin .when applying this on your own , you do n't need to have a separate hand on any other part of your body .you can just apply directly to the skin .the first thing we 're going to do is just kind of work into the skin in circular motions .this is really doing amazing things with the skin .it 's bringing oxygen to the skin .these gels actually have a negative pull to them .because we are using negative current , we 're actually pushing that product very deep within the skin to bind impurities .the areas we 'll really want to concentrate on are any areas of congestion .typically , most clients will have it around the nose , the chin , around the t-zone areas .you 'll notice also that the machine is beeping .that is telling me that the current is working.
make sure that you have your pan properly positioned to catch any additional oil which may drain out .so , we 're going to check , we do have the same type , the 7317 type oil filter .then we 're going to set the old oil filter aside.
next thing i 'll show you the snake arms .for snake arms it 's very important to keep yourself in correct posture , tail bone tucked under ,knees slightly bent and chest lifted .we 're going to start with your left arm , elbow up first through the wrist , through the knuckles and through the fingertips and to release that , elbow , wrist and fingers .elbow up , wrist , fingers , elbow down , wrist , fingers .and again , the points to hit are elbow up , wrist up , knuckles , and through the fingertips .elbow , wrist , and down to the fingers .to smooth that out , this is what it would look like .again , keeping your posture , elbow , wrist , fingers , elbow , wrist , fingers .now the other arm .you want to bring the elbow up , wrist , knuckles , fingers , elbow , wrist , fingers .elbow , wrist , fingers , elbow , wrist , fingers .and smoothing it out , and to put it together , what you want to do , starting with your left arm , elbow , wrist fingers , and as that turns to come down , the other elbow , wrist , fingers .again , as that turns to come down , elbow , wrist , fingers , and as that comes down , the other one 's coming up .and here is a smooth snake arm .
now it 's time to feed the beast .it 's time to load your paintball gun .now you open the top up .you 've got your hopper firmly attached to the weapon .and make sure .it has a little indent on the inside of it .so you can tell when it 's firmly in there .when you 're loading your weapon calmly by the gun hut , off the field , it 's a pretty straight forward thing .there you go .you have paint .now when you 're loading under fire it can be a little bit different .one thing you ought to remember is if you can have a team mate cover you while you reload , that is best .i 've been shot several times while trying to reload my paint.
when most people think of ceramic , they think of the ashtray they made their mom in 3rd grade .it 's not that .it 's actually a metal oxide .if you take a aluminum and you super heat it and add oxygen , that 's basically what you 're going to get .it makes it conduct electricity super great .it also puts out a lot of negative ions , which again , helps that water to evaporate , cut down on frizz , and help the hair dry faster .ceramic is something that you 're definitely going to want to get whenever looking into any of these products .curling irons have it .flat irons have it .they all have the ceramic coating , so it 's not something that 's going to break like a bowl or something .it 's a coating.
now again just like the hip abduction machine you want to make sure that you become familiar with it before you get started , so here 's where we 'll be sitting , here are handles , here are the pads that we 're going to be resting our legs against , the stirrups for our feet 's and then on this side we have the handle that we pulling in ,okay just pull it up and out.
now , i 'm going to show you how to improvise with these notes .remember when you improvise , let 's try to think about the notes .let 's try to hear it in our heads before we play it next , okay .we 're going to use all the accidentals we can in an a minor melodic scale .so , let 's play the scale first to get it in your ear .that 's an a minor melodic scale .let 's improvise now .
so now we are going to move on to a different technique .this is a technique where you use glitter to make a glitter design without the use of the gilded paste .here is the glue that i 'm going to use.

also panasonic has an exclusive agreement with leica and leica makes great lenses too .which are better ?well it 's real hard to say , they are all fairly equivalent and it depends on who you talk to as far as professional photographers which lenses they like .another thing that 's important is flash , how far will the flash go and the lower end of the lens and.
okay .so i 've got all these clippings for my new strings and the bulk of my old strings to deal with .and again , as i 've said , the only real safety concern with changing guitar strings is these sharp ends that strings can have on them , and you do n't want these in a plastic trash bag , loose , where they can poke through and scratch somebody or even impale somebody .so you 're just going to go ahead and wrap them carefully in a loose coil like this , and your goal is to kinda tuck all those sharp ends , you know , towards the inside .and then you can get one of these paper , little bags that the strings can pack in and even if you want to be extra careful , pack it back inside the vinyl or cardboard packaging.
okay.
the mechanics of the back cast and the forward cast are exactly the same .they are just going in opposite directions .it has been called by many things trying to describe it .mel kreigel calls it the whump , whump move .lefty cray says speed up and stop , which is excellent .mccaulie lord who teaches at l.l .
onions are one that you can sometimes get in small bulbs that you can plant out , and that makes it pretty easy .but if you want the most economical way to raise onions , you want to go ahead , and buy a package of seeds .now there again , with seeds are tiny .these seeds are little tiny black specks of seeds that are onion seeds , and you want to plant them about one time as deep as they are thick .so we 're talking what , maybe a sixteenth or a eighteenth of an inch in size .it is n't going to be very much .now you can just kind of sprinkle them into the area , like we 're doing here .you can make a row if you want , but i like to just kind of put em ' into the earth box all over , and if you do that ; you can kinda ' go ahead , and sprinkle them out.
we finished our sound mix and we open up original edit project in this case it was cut in final cut pro .i want to import the audio and get it back into the session.
we can use a number of tools to cut our plants ( demonstrates ) we can use scissors ( regular kitchen scissors .
we 're back .we 're going to be talking about your child 's food allergy and the symptoms that could possibly happen .things that you want to look for .some common things that you would n't even think would be a problem and that you may not even be allergic to , for some reason your child has built up an allergy to this .and it could have some serious , serious symptoms .something could even be the child could stop breathing , they may have breathing difficulty , go into anaphylactic shock , and those are just some of the major ones .and those can happen do to something like peanuts .peanuts are known to and lots , quite a few people are actually allergic to peanuts , to the point where they ca n't even be other nuts ca n't even be in the vicinity of the peanut and they will have a reaction to it .severity could be shock , could be breathing difficulty , your throat starts closing up .this happens a lot with shellfish , also .and the other things are mucus forming foods like wheat and milk .these are both very mucus forming foods .so they can actually , your child can develop a lot of mucus problems where they 're either coughing or they 're doing a lot of throat clearing , that ( throat clearing sound ) feeling , that kind of feeling .these can cause that a lot with your child , especially skin diseases like eczema ,acne , those types of things can be attributed to wheat and milk especially .these are obviously more food sensitivities and basically not true allergies but they are symptoms and just the mere taking these foods away can alleviate many of these more minor type symptoms and that can really help your child out .
and now we 're going to discuss `` dusk imp '' .dusk imp is another powerful card out of the black color .this is in the basic black , 10th edition .as we see here , is a creature `` imp , '' which means he gets benefits for all things that benefit imps , and it 's 2 and a black to play , so you 're playing dusk imp for 2 and a black , which has a converted mana of cost of 3.you 're going to get a 2/1 for this cost , which is almost even mana production ; however , as you see here , creature is going to have an ability , his ability is flying .and once again , flying is a very powerful ability because this creature can only be blocked by creatures with flying and or creatures with reach , which means that you now have a 2/1 instead of a 1/1 flyer , which means this card can do twice as much damage as those other cards , and it has flying , which a lot of decks are not built to defend against flying creatures .this is a very powerful card .
( playing guitar ) please see the next video in this series for the next segment of impetu .
i 've been keeping reptiles and amphibians for over forty years .i 'm here to talk to you about southern cricket frogs .this is a very small frog , about that big , that occurs in the southern united states , and they actually look kind of like toads , because their skin is bumpy or granular .and they can come in a variety of patterns .some of them have stripes on them that can be green , some of them have a reddish stripe .and these are very small frogs that occur in , usually permanent bodies of water .your area creeks , lakes or swamps .they get their name cricket frog because of their call .it sounds like a cricket .they can be rather noisy .fishermen like to use cricket frogs for bait .i once saw somebody pick up a little cricket frog and throw him out in the pond , they said this was a bass test .and the water erupted , and that frog was eaten pretty quickly by a big bass .so obviously , they like to eat 'em .but they 're very quick frogs , live in the water 's edge , hop around in the mud close to the water where it 's wet , and in the springtime they can be rather noisy if you 're in an area where they 're calling .
this is the most essential part .this is going to be your basis for your spin later on , and this is a really crucial part .so , here 's how you do it .when you come up , you 're going to have the correct speed.
let 's go over the smile chest movement .this movement will combine both the torso slide and the chest pulled .make sure your feet are parallel to each other , slightly apart , knees are bent , belly button 's pulled in towards the spine , chest is lifted , shoulders are relaxed and down .arms are out to your side .first let 's slide our chest out to one side .now we 're going to bring the chest in toward our body and slide to the other side and release back to a neutral position .now pull , slide out to the side , pull in and slide over and release .slide , pull in , over and release .now let 's try it with some music .five , six , seven , eight .now try that at home in front of the mirror .
so in this video we 're going to start thinking about how we 're putting all the phrases together , combining different scratches.
it is very important that you have your primary chain and adjustment .on this particular brand of motorcycle , harley davidson road king , your drain plug is right here under the primary ; takes a torque  s 40 , turn it out and just let it drain .you will see that this is a magnetic plug .some times there will be slight shavings on this plug because the chain does off shavings with wear .don  t be alarmed if there are some shavings on it .you will want to discard this plug and get you a new plug .now we have the primary fluid draining out .if at this time you smell anything that smells burnt , very burnt , like a burnt nasty , stinky , awful smell , odds are that you are having a problem with your stator .if you don  t have any kind of nasty smells but just has an oil smell to it.
stretches through the hips and for the lower body - grab yourself plenty of space .bring your feet out as comfortable as you can feel in your inner thigh muscles .we 're going to take both hands together .we 're just going to reach down the leg and come on down as far as we can .once we 're down here , we like to hold as long as we can and start to focus on your breath .if i 'm going to take a side angle here.
stretching the inner thigh , just find a soft surface or a mat to lay on , and focus on your feet going together , and then bring the feet right down .when you lay down to stretch the inner thigh.
so we can either call it a stunt or a blitz .what we 're going to do is we 're going bring these guys out .now we have 8 men up against the offensive line .there 's no possible way that those guys can block everybody coming through .that makes the quarterback on the other side have a lot of pressure on him .he 's either going to have to hand it off quickly , or if he 's got to pass.
first of all this is a feather duster .now most people think that you know to really be an effective duster you got to move a lot .that 's actually not the case .you basically just want to brush the dust away lightly .and then also with this feather brush , you never want to shake it inside the house because it 's going to just redistribute all the dust again that you just picked up on it .so always take it outside , shake it out .also with a microfiber towel like this , when you 're dusting do n't get really aggressive like this cause all that 's going to do is stir up a whole bunch of dust .you want to just lightly swipe it so that you 're cleaning up the dust .hold it up in there.
to become a veterinarian i think you just basically need to be a good student especially as far as math and science goes and more importantly i think that it is very important to develop good study habits because once you get through high school and you get into college and you do n't have.

today i 'm going to talk about how do you test your eye muscles to make sure that they just wo n't work and why that is so important .like i have said , and just to reiterate , to test your eye muscles is an important step because you want to show yourself that you yourself can relax yourself .once you relax , there are many opportunities that you have as far as teaching yourself how to better focus , how to gain the skills that you want , how to help improve your self confidence , but why we test our eye muscles is to make sure that we know how to relax .so , brad , will you help me demonstrate how you test your eye muscles ?yeah .so , brad , just go ahead and close your eyes right now for me and place your focus and attention on your eye muscles to the point that they just wo n't open , to make sure that they just wo n't work .and when you 're sure that they just wo n't work because you 've decided to relax your eye muscles to that point .when you 're sure they just wo n't work , just go ahead and test them ever so slightly to make sure they wo n't work .okay , very good .excellent work .when you 're ready , just let your eye muscles open , let your eyes open and resume back in this room with us .that 's great .now , did you hear me ?i said make sure that they just wo n't work .i did n't say make sure that they will work ,because if you are going to test them to make sure they will open , that 's exactly what will happen , is they 'll open .we want you to show yourself that you can relax yourself to the point that they just wo n't work .it 's all in the language .that 's what 's most important .

this is called the panion .this panion is accurately for personal training or for transporting the bird from the house to the club .so it has the small opening in the front , on the top , where you can put the pigeon inside and you can take it out .because of the small opening on the top , the less chances of a bird flying out and escaping .so you put the pigeon inside and the thing is coming from all the three sides so as to avoid the feather getting stuck into the net and getting spoiled so it will protect the feathers from getting spoiled .in front there is one big dual as you can call it ; it can be opened .when you are going to train your pigeon , you put the pigeon inside this and you take it in your car to a point where you want to train your bird where you want to toss your bird and then after that , you just open this .as you can see , there are safety hook so that it may not open out because if it is on the way it opens out , it starts flying inside the car then the pigeon will get hurt .then you go to an open place where there are no trees or wires and all that because when they fly out they might hit the wire and injure themselves .you just open them and then all the pigeons will just come home .then they will fly and then they will navigate and they 'll try to come home .thank you .
d , e , f , are considered to be white diamonds .and as we go down to g , h , they are slightly tinted white .and when we go to i , j , they are slightly tinted yellow .and as we keep on going down the shades keep on decreasing .now , i show you just to give you a brief example , i show you the two diamonds just to know the difference between the colors .here , i have one piece which is a white diamond .this diamond is d in color .now , i show you the other piece , now i show you the other piece , this piece is j in color .now if you compare these two stones you will get to know the difference in the color of a diamond .so as the color goes up , up till d , the prices goes up , and as the color comes down to the slightly tinted yellow the prices will come down .so you can see the difference , the shade and the prices are identically proportion to each other .so now i hope you know how to choose the color of a diamond .thank you .
and , i can take these three photographs , for example , and i want to go 'start .
ok in this clip , we 're going to talk about riding the bevel .this right here , on the back of your tool , is called the bevel , and when you 're turning the interior of a bowl , you want to make sure that you 're riding that bevel , because by riding the bevel , you 're giving the bowl gouge , the tool that you 're cutting with , support as you 're going through the cut .if you 're not riding the bevel , what you 're doing , is you 're allowing that cutting edge to be unsupported , and it can cause a catch .a catch is something that happens quite often in wood turning , and i 'll show you what a very exaggerated example , of what a catch would be .a catch would be something like that , and that stops the bowl blank , and it also puts a divot or a gouge in your wood .now if this was turning at seven hundred , nine hundred , or.
this series is about the poker variants sequence .it falls into the stud classification of poker games .just to make sure we all know how stud is played , here is a sample game of stud .it 's 2 cards down to every player at the table and then 1 card up.

after the death of a pet , its advisable to let some of the other adults in your child , or children 's , life know , to be a little extra more aware that this has happened and that your child may be needing some addition attention .or maybe acting out in different ways .you can do this in the form of just sending a note to the school .writing a short note to teachers , coaches , scout leaders , religious instructors .you can call them on the phone or let them know in person .the reason that this is advisable , also , that sometimes children are not going to show a lot of distress at home .they may not be talking to you about it .you may kind of wonder `` well boy .does n't seem like its bothering them at all .
this functional core exercise using the stability ball is called an abdominal crunch .basically , just come on down to the ball and make sure you have got a good balance and a solid foundation .simply walk your feet out and place the small of your back on the stability ball .make sure that your feet are hip width apart , place your hands gently behind your head , and keep your elbows wide .and you want to tuck your chin slightly and just image that you have a tennis ball between your chin and your chest .and then you want to come up , exhale as you lift and inhale as you come back .now , what can really make this exercise affective is if you image that you are snapping your rib cage close together here .never open up and really release that tension in your abdominal region .so you want to really contract and stay contracted the entire time .and exhale as you come up , inhale as you come back .exhale up , inhale as you come back .now , generally speaking you want to perform this exercise until you fatigue through your abdominal muscles until you really feel that burn .when you are finished simply sit up , walk your feet up , and that is your abdominal crunch .
now i want to encourage you , like i said in the last clip , to actively seek out information , use everyday situations to find out more about yourself , but be careful .do n't start driving people crazy asking them all the time , `` well , what did you think ?well did you think i was expressive enough ?well did you think i was assertive enough ?well how do you think i sounded ?how do you think that went with that coworker ?how ...
and it is very important because you need to be able to move your slides first of all for intonation.
this next functional core exercise is called the front toe drops , and this is a really great exercise to work that core stabilization , so really think about your breathing and then really think about drawing that belly in .come on down to the floor and bring your arms down alongside your body .pull your shoulder blades back and down .bring your legs up into a tabletop position and then really think about lowering your lower back down to the mat .make sure that your knees are directly over your hips and that your feet are in line with your knees .let 's just start with one leg at a time .inhale as you lower your right leg down and.

now we 're going to work on putting a background image on a website .but before we do that , i 'm going to actually make a background image in photoshop.
so when you go through and you read , you want to try to read off the root .so you have a melody say like this .so you can start , just go through and number 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 7 , 6 , 7 , 1 and jumps up to the 3 , 4 and 5th .so you can see the pattern now .if you go through and start with a different root with a different scale , you can play the exact same melody in every key .so you really want to go through and analyze this .now if you have some stuff in here that looks like this .say you have a flat in front of this 3 here , so that would be a flat 3.
okay , so we just finished priming the wall and we are going to let that dry for about an hour and in the meantime our next step in our bedroom project is to do some caulking .now there are several types of caulk on the market and you want to make sure you get he painter 's caulk .some of the other brands you wo n't be able to paint over them.
okay , our vegetables are in the oven , roasting .our chicken is in the oven , roasting .we 've wilted our spinach .we 've boiled our cream for our potatoes .so , while we 're waiting for our chicken and vegetables to be ready , we 're going to go ahead and make our mashed potatoes .so , we 'll bring our potatoes over to the sink , and we 'll drain the water out .we 're going to keep this pot , because we 're actually going to go ahead , and mash our potatoes straight in here .we make sure that all of our burners are off , and we 're , we 're going to mash these about half way , like this , and then we 're going to come back and take our milk and butter liquid .we 're going to stir this in so that the potatoes incorporate ; all of em ' , and we 're going to go ahead and mash them down the rest of the way .
i 'm going to go ahead and spray it with some non-stick spray .then we 're going to lift up our angel cookie slowly .it should n't stick too much because of the flour .after it 's loose , you can just lift it up and just lay this on here .do the same for the other cookies .right now , we 're going to go ahead and just make 3 of them .we 're going to go ahead and throw these in the oven at 400 degrees for 6-8 minutes , or until you see that they 've become brown around the edges .at this point , our cookies have cooked .as we can see , they 're starting to turn brown around the edges .we could have pulled these out probably a minute quicker , but that 's just fine .we 're going to cover these up anyway .go ahead and pull these off .i 'm going to put them on a wire cooling rack .i 'm going to let these cool for about 30 minutes or until they 're hard .we do n't want to mess with them when they 're too soft because we put the icing on there .they 'll rip , so go ahead and get prepared .we 're going to make our icing next .
alright , the first step in making our eggplant sandwich is taking a good large eggplant is better because you want large slices .i 'm peeling it.
in this clip , i 'm going to be doing an oblique isolation .now this has no weight to it , so you can get this almost anywhere.
alright , the next thing you need to remember when you 're using humor , especially a joke , but it could also be and anecdote a funny story , you must keep your eyes on your audience , when you 're talking about the humor .i 'm looking at you ,i 'm telling the joke .i 'm looking at you ,i 'm telling the funny story about my aunt bernice .whatever it is , keep your eye on the audience .what you must never , ever , ever , ever , do is read the punchline of a joke off the paper .see , i could say , `` hey where does spaghetti go to dance ?a meatball .
the first thing i 'll discuss is what is an open chord and how do you play an open chord .now , an open chord is a chord that includes an open string .now an open string is nothing more than a string being plucked with no fingers on it .so , for example here , this string will be considered open .it will be closed if i had a finger on it .so , if i put my finger on it here , you 'll say that string is now closed .a chord that is opened will be a chord that involves as long as there 's one open string in the chord , it will be called an open chord .so for example as we 'll see in a minute , it 's a c chord .you would call it an open chord because you have three strings that have no fingers on them .even though , one of the strings is closed , there 's at least one string with no fingers making it an open chord .
once the mushrooms are ready we can add the green beans into the pot and continue mixing all the ingredients .then we would add the spice , just the thyme , the garlic powder , and also a pinch of nutmeg and this time we used a nutmeg grinder or you can preground nutmeg in this case .black pepper a little bit.
don  t get your threads started right.
we 've got the antennas in place , and now we 're ready to add the legs .we 're going to do that in the first loop after the head .so , we 're going to do the same kind of approach , and we 're going to pinch the loop ,on the side , small incision .we 're going to make two of those , on either side .so , i 'm going to turn this , so that we can get a good angle .pinching and cutting , and then we 're going to feed these through .you 're going to start on one side and go for the other .ok , then hopefully it comes through on the other side .you may have to feed it through from the inside of the loop .there it is .you just want to do this very carefully , not to break the paper .and we 'll do the same thing with the second leg .we 'll give him two sets of legs , feeding it through .if the loop , if the cut is n't large enough , we can always go back and change that .going back inside this paper loop and feeding it through again .and , pulling it through really gently .if your paper loop comes undone , we can always tape it back down .and now , we 're going to shape these up .and , we 're just going to give them a couple of bends , up one and then down one .up one , down one , we 'll do the same with the ones below .and there you have your legs .
alright , we 've got all this information now that we have either found out or developed about our character .now , this is so important in drama because drama is tragedy , drama is crisis , drama is serious .as human beings , we react and respond to everything because of the way we were raised , what our background is .for example , if my mother automatically yells at stuff , then i could very easily automatically yell in a crisis situation .that 's real life .so , what we 're trying to do with these dramatic characters.
there are a number of different ways to separate the melody notes in bagpipe music .the easiest and most simple is a single grace note and then the other most other common way is to have a grace note which are known as doublings .that gives you sort of a one , two pulse in between a note .you can play a doubling on any note on the chanter .you can come to it from any note on the chanter .so , for example , if you were playing a c doubling , you can come to it from e or f or a or any other note .and what these do is they add not only space between the notes , but sort of sometimes a bubbly effect.
normally , when you 're doing applique and hand quilting an 18-inch length of thread is about as long as you can have .the reason for that is that the thread starts to wear out and then it begins to knot , but the problem is , is that you have to keep stopping and starting and stopping and starting .an 18-inch length is really pretty frustrating because you do n't get to stitch for very long before you have to change threads .so , what we 're going to be doing today in the next step is we 're going to be showing how you can prepare thread to have a longer length to virtually eliminate your knots and make it so that you can thread your needle very , very easily .
ok , so , i 'm going around the house , and.
i 'm meagan burroughs , and we are going to cover one of the most dangerous falls that are being performed right now .this is called the suicide fall .you 're going to do it out of a climb.

okay on this segment we 're going to focus on your forehand slice , slash , block return of serve .when i play people , if they have a really big first serve ; a lot of times , i might just simplify my whole task of returning and block the first one .and if they miss the first one , on the second serve , i might attack it with a lot of topspin , but a lot of times when they know you are going to return it every time , because you 're just going to be blocking it ; it simplifies it .it makes them start trying to hit the ball a little harder .so actually , serving and returning , there 's kind of a little tug of war or a little chest match going on .so , i 'm going to serve from the mid court to ken 's forehand.

i 'm a master instructor at the jim mclean golf school in miami florida .in this clip we 're going to talk about , how to choose the correct sand wedge .the very important thing to know about the sand wedge , is that all sand wedge have what is called a bounce .a bounce is where the club , is what we 're going to use to hit the ground or the sand .and the more bounce the club has , the more the club is obviously going to bounce .if you 're playing in a court that has very soft bunkers and a very soft surface , you need more bounce , for the club to react against the sand , the soft sand .if you 're playing on wet grass , or bunkers that does not have much sand , you need less bounce .for example , with the tyler 's club they show different numbers , and these numbers come from 4 to 14 , this is a middle bounce , because it 's a 08.so many two players travel and they have the same club with different levels of bounce , and depending on the golf condition , how hard , how soft it is , they 're going to pick the right one for that week .this is julio nutt at the jim mclean golf school , just talking a little bit about , how to pick the right sand wedge .
now , we 've talked about monotone , which is using , you know , you do n't want to be monotone , which is using just one pitch .you want to use those two or three pitches .but another vocal expression that you want to think about is rate of speed .and when i 'm talking about rate of speed , i 'm talking about moderate , fast , or slow .now , generally , most of your speech is going to be moderate , or it should be .we tend to go a little bit faster when we 're nervous , so you want to be very aware that you 're speaking in a moderate pace : not too slow , not to fast , where people can understand .but there are certain times when you might want to go a little faster .or if you 're really trying to drive a point , you might slow down .so remember , in addition to using those two to three different pitches ; you 're going to want to use two to three different rates of speed .
the next type of waxing is what 's known as the hot wax .this is the traditional method used first with skis for centuries and for snowboards now .i do n't have an iron .i just , i usually use this all-condition paste .they do make temperature specific and condition specific waxes , but your safest bet is just to get an iron-on all-purpose wax .and if this was your iron and this was the wax.

i 'm going to talk to you about how to replace an element in the oven .in all your typical ovens you have a lower element and an upper element .and these plug in to the main electrical source in the back of the oven .and to replace these all you need to do , there are two quarter inch hex head screws that hold the security plate in place .and i 'm not going to remove this particular one because you do n't want to remove an element if it 's a good element .so we 'll just do this for demonstration purposes .but you would unscrew these two screws here and then slide that element out .now of course it 's very important to make sure that your power is turned off whenever you do this .so you want to go to your main breaker , identify the breakers for your oven and you want to turn those breakers to the off position .anytime you 're dealing with any kind of electrical elements , something like that , you want to make sure that that power is cut .so , once you remove that , then you can take that element and you can take it to the home improvement store , you can take it to the place where you actually purchased your appliance and they should be able to help you match up with a similar element to come back in .but it 's really more or less just an unplug and plug in type of operation from when you do that .and that 's all there is to it .so i 'm tim gipson and that 's how to replace an element in your oven .

and i 've written a book on `` how to become a professional bachelor .
there are a couple of different formats that insect repellents are available in .one of them is lotions , the other being sprays .sprays break down in a couple of different formats .you have the pump spray and you have an aerosol .as we discussed earlier , aerosol is not the best format , because aerosol does contain alcohol .alcohol does dilute the pours of your skin , which increases the absorption of the active ingredient in your insect repellent into your skin , and you do not want that to happen .you want the insect repellent to float on top of your skin , because once it absorbs down in there , it becomes ineffective .these two particular sprays , the pump sprays , are oil based , so they 're going to be a little greasy , a little oily on your skin .the 100 percent deet obviously is like the mac-daddy , it really , really , really works with mosquito 's , but it is a little bit oily .the two lotion based , are more skin friendly , they go on , they have a lower odor , they do n't stink as badly , your typical insect repellent odor , and they 're a little more skin friendly , in terms of how they feel on your skin .but they all work , in certain application .the only one that we do not recommend of course , is the alcohol base , the aerosol , which you ca n't take on a plane anyway .so that pretty much sums up the different formats .

hello , and thanks again for joining us .now i 'd like to share with you the many important reasons , and explain why it 's extremely important to replace the protein that you lose when you work out .there 's multiple types of ways to be able to do that .a great protein shake can do that in the flavor of your choice .some protein drinks have more grams of protein in them than others , so the ones that have the highest amount , of course are the ones that will help to replenish that protein level faster .there 's multiple types of bars that are out there that you can choose from for any types of flavors and the things that you like , and to suit your tastes .there 's many things that you can do when you go home or go out to eat to making those correct choices of why it 's so important for you to eat and replace that protein , so that you can build that nice lean muscle .so , lean lean meats is a wonderful thing to use , fish ; not fried , stay away from the fried stuff .you want to keep it healthy , keep that protein natural and beneficial to you .not to have to combat other elements that you put in your body .so , keep that protein up .you you 'll build nice lean muscle , and you 'll feel so good for doing it and treating yourself healthy too .so thanks , and we 'll be right back .

tip number 12 :mixing styles .like with mixing metals , mixing styles of jewelry can be a fun way to get a little bit more complex with your jewelry .this is definitely a more advanced technique , and not something we necessarily would recommend doing immediately off the bat as you begin to select jewelry .however , since we 're talking about how to choose jewelry , it is important to incorporate the notion of how to mix styles of jewelry .whether they 're styles that you already have , or styles that you 're shopping for at the time , choosing your jewelry every morning is always an exercise in exploration .depending on your mood and how you feel on a given day , you may feel like mixing one style of jewelry , for example antique , with another style of jewelry , for example costume jewelry .the best way to do this is to try and keep one singular theme running between all of the styles .so , using our example of antique and costume jewelry , find some antique jewelry that has some stones or one color of metal and then select your costume jewelry also with a similar stone or metal .it does n't have to be the same color of stones .just the fact that it 's stones is enough .or if you have a bunch of different kinds of jewelry that have different styles but all similar colors , then that can be your single theme .to keep a consistent theme running among your jewelry when your mixing styles will keep it from looking messy and make you look neat , but still intricate .
but what is also recognizable on this painting that he grabbed back to the old tradition of painting adam and eve in life size , full body to the old german and netherlandish paintings like van eyck or other german painters from the 15th , and other german painters from the 15th century .and it has the message that after the creation adam and eve were completely naked and standing lonely in the nature .it shows not only the woman power of eve but the loneliness of the human person in the nature .

how do you determine if an instructor is qualified ?that 's kind of difficult .why ?the martial arts is an unlicensed profession .in other words , there are no specific universally recognized standards .anybody can buy a black belt and put it on .anybody can open a martial arts school .so there 's no barrier to entry which makes it a really good business if you are qualified .but it also opens the door for quackery and people who pass themselves off as being what they 're not .in order to access the qualifications of a good instructor you want to make sure , number one , top of the list , you want to know what you 're trying to accomplish .what is it , do you want to become a champion ?do you want to become a black belt ?do you want to become very proficient in self defense ?or do you just want the mental confidence that goes in to the martial arts ?once you know your goals , then its a matter of researching the instructors in your area .go watch the classes .and here 's what you 're looking for .you 're looking for an instructor that you think is going to motivate you .you 're looking for an instructor that going to keep you excited about coming back to class .initially with students , i like to help them set black belt as a goal .that takes about three years .so really think about it , three year span to earn your black belt .as we 're watching this instructor work we want to see how he or she works with the beginning students.
now let me continue with the next segment of the shaolin continuous boxing .starting from the previous segment .one , two , kick , punch , walk down , step .okay .let me show it to you again .starting from here , your right hand goes , one , two , turn into bow stand , this hand is your hook , you perform this hand as a palm .now you 're going to bring this hand in , your left hand in .you 're going to bring your right hand over your head.
o.k.
so now i 'm going to some spouts , but before i start i 'm going to show you something important about spouts .if you look closely at this pot you can see that there 's a bulge that comes all the way down to here .that spout originally was thrown about this wide , and then cut at an angle .the reason for this is because the water or the tea in the pot needs to have a place to travel .if the spout only starts way up here , it 's not going to start pouring until it reaches that area , but if the spout starts way down here , it 'll start traveling through the spout early on in the pour .it makes for a much smoother pouring teapot .so now i 'm going to take this clay and center it again .but instead of leaving the floor for this , i 'm actually going to open all the way through to the head of the wheel , and i 'll pull this apart .you see i 'm going pretty wide , as i said that spout needs to start out pretty wide at the base , you can always cut it to make it smaller , but you ca n't make it bigger.
but i did not.

duplicate whist .duplicate is the format that the american contract bridge league uses for all their games from the club level all the way up to the national and even the international level .in any card game ...any card game , i do n't care if it 's poker , i do n't care if it 's go fish.
the next thing i am going to show you is called a step touch .you can do the step touch to the front to the side and to the back .we 're going to start in the front .make sure you 're in good posture .what you want to do is make sure your knees are bent .chest is lifted we 're going to bring one foot forward and touch .when you touch just put a little weight into it .step , touch put a little weight into it and your hips going to come forward .so again when you come forward step , touch .just put a little weight into it when you touch .step , touch .step , touch .step touch.

in this clip we are going to talk about the proper service procedure for removing and replacing a rear axle u joint on a ford explorer .in this step we are going to talk about lubricating of your replacement u joint .what i have here is the remnants of my ford equipment u joint .as you can see it , it 's junk , and one of the things that ?s missing on it is the grease fitting .this u joint is sealed and lubricated at the factory .there is no further maintenance you can do to this throughout the life of the vehicle .your after market replacement u joint is going to come with a grease fitting .now the u joint is already lubricated with some grease .however , what you ?re going to want to do is use your grease gun and fill it up until you see grease shooting out from the u joint seals .i 'm going to go ahead and pop that on right now and give it a couple shots .alright , we are going to go ahead and give it a couple pumps until we see grease coming out of the u joint seal area .at this point in time , it 's a good idea to inspect your front u joint to see if it has a fitting .greasing it right now would be a lot easier than after installing the drive shaft on the vehicle .this particular drive shaft has the factory fitting on it.

and i 'll demonstrate this .so that 's topspin , and what that 's going to do is you 're going to be able to hit the ball hard.
so , we 've got the iceman from the homegrown band out there right now with my little puppy bongo , and me and the lovely e are going to go out and join them , and we 're going to go for a nice , long paddle .paddling , you 're actually going to be working out pretty central muscle mass , you 're going to be working out your biceps , shoulders , arms , pretty much everything in here , but a lot of core .if you 're going for long distance paddles , the biggest thing you 're going to be working with is core right here .i mean sometimes it 's a little tighter than other times.
when you receive your trays back in about 3 weeks , you will also be given about a 2 week , 14 day supply of the whitening syringes that go in the trays that you are to fill them with .what you 'll do with these is you 'll be careful to not overly insert too much of the material ,the whitening gel , and the reason for that is because you use almost a half of a syringe for each whitening period that you do .so a quarter of a syringe for an upper , a quarter of a syringe for a lower , and the reason why you want to be careful not to put too much gel is because once this gel goes into the tray and into your mouth , once it becomes the temperature of your mouth it will tend to liquefy more.
the consistency of that is a larger grand firework which normally you will not see unless it 's in a firework display such as the white house or the washington memorial displays they have in washington dc or the bigger cities .the class b fireworks what you see usually in your local community shot off at ballparks and at different events , you can get those at larger suppliers but you must have a special class b license to shoot those and also to purchase those .you must also be professionally trained to do that and to have those through the american power techniques association to be certified through that and to be able to cover those areas to shoot a ball , anything 2 and a quarter inches up to a 12 inch ball .okay , if you were looking at shooting class b fireworks or purchasing them , you will have to go through a mandated fbi background check to get those .and usually that consist of atf also .you have to go through an extensive check out to check your background , the same thing that you do when getting a gun permit .but it 's a little bit more involved , you would also have to go through regulations of where you carry your fireworks , where they 're stored at , and of course you know a federal government needs to know that at all times .if you shop for fireworks or if you 're still housing them and of course what you use so.

another variation of the cartwheel is a round off .now the round off is very similar to the cartwheel except for we have a torso turn and instead of our legs hitting the floor one by one , our legs will hit the floor together .now , when starting a cartwheel , the best way to learn is by taping a line of masking tape across the floor that you 're going to be using .once you have that masking tape set , you can put your toe on the line to start .now the first thing that 's going to hit the floor is going to be your first hand .now if you 're right handed that 's going to be your right hand .if you 're left handed you simply take the other end of the line.
swans on roller with a single twist .again if you just found me and you have n't seen the previews on the series you might want to check out the proper technique to do a swan on the roller and some tips on how to get a good roller that does n't warp on you .we are going to lay down on our stomach , our heels are going to be together and toes apart.
this upper body tubing exercise is the triceps overhead extension version number one .grab your tubing and you should be about light to medium resistance .and you 're going to take one hand and place it inside the handle , flip your hand over and grab a little bit of the tubing with the handle .and then i 'm going to turn around and show you that behind you you 're going to grab the tubing .now you have small tubing between your hands the more resistance , the more tubing you have the less resistance .so you can crank up and adjust that .so you are going to have your arms in place and just extend up and lower down .now try to keep the elbow as close to head as possible .if you have shoulder issues then take this hand down alongside your hips so that you ?re not pulling your shoulder out of place .so you want to extend up and lower down .so you 're really isolating that tricep area .exhale as you lift up , inhale as you lower down .now just perform this exercise until you fatigue out that tricep and then switch to the other side .and that is your tricep overhead extension version number one .

today we 're going to talk about how to diagnose an ailment of your fish .part of keeping a fish is making sure that we visually inspect them everyday .when we feed them we want to make sure that they have a good appetite and that their fins are not torn , they 're not in rough shape , they 're not sitting at the bottom .once you 've been keeping your fish for a while , you 're going to know if they 're acting different .a common problem with fish is ick which is tiny white spots over the entire fish itself .a lot of ailments are caused by stress which can be water quality , temperature and fish stressing out other fish themselves .one thing that i like to start with if there is a regular ailment going on is using a natural product .we have melafix and pemefix .melafix is an anti-bacterial and pemefix is an anti-fungal .what i like to do is use both of them together because its not an exact science of exactly what 's going on with the fish so if there is a bacterial problem , we can take care of fungus as well if that happens to be part of the issue as well .simply follow directions and it tells you exactly how much to use , when you should do a water change .another thing that you can put in your tank is aquarium salt .aquarium salt raises the electrolytes in the tank and it also helps reduce stress .my name is michael and today we 're talking about how to diagnose an ailment .
with this tricep exercise with the cable pulley system , we 're going to use this rope .so we 're going to have control over our prime mechanics and our active range of motion .straight bar is really going to dictate your mechanics .so , with this we can really kind of arc like ,kind of like you would with a bowflex .and that 's what the cable pulley system emulates .so with the elbows in by the side , we do n't start the movement from up here .this is one of the biggest mistakes i 'll see when i 'm in a facility , is people will start their tricep movement from here .and as you could see , i 'm not even using triceps .so if i bring them right down here beside my side , that is the point of initiation of the movement .and then i 'm going to contract with that three-headed muscle on the back of the arm and release right back to neutral where my wrists , elbows and shoulders are in line .again , feet hip width apart.
a variation of the separation between the activities and the hands .you have already the circle and we did this movement , so now we try to do a circle like that.

i 'm a certified master mechanic out of reading , pennsylvania .today , we 're going to talk about , how to know if you 've got a faulty thermostat in your car .the easiest way to tell , the thermostat will give you two different problems .either one , your car is going to run too hot and overheat , and two , it will run too cold , and you get no heat .now , a thermostat sticks closed , you 're not going to get any flow going through the motor .it 's going to overheat on you .the second thing it 's going to do , it 's going to stick open , and you 're actually getting no heat , because it 's going to constantly circle , and not build any heat inside the engine .the way to tell whether or not you have a faulty thermostat , you have an upper and lower radiator hose .after the engine warms up , about 195 degrees ,you obviously either , if it 's stuck open , do n't do this if it 's stuck closed , but if it 's stuck open , and you 're getting no heat.
and i 'm.
now the first thing you 're going to need is you 're going to need to type of paint that you 're going to use .typically what you want to use is a semi-gloss or a gloss paint .it shines a lot more and it 's a lot easier to clean .you 're also going to need some painter 's caulk -- it 's got to be paintable caulk --some 3m blue tape ( either a two or three inch roll ) , an angled brush , a caulk gun , sandpaper , may need a scraper , a five-in-one or a putty knife , and then you 'll need some spackling putty .okay , first thing you 're going to do is you 're going to want to prepare your window casings .so if you have any nail holes or any type of gouges in the casing , what you 're going to want to do.
so i can cut it down to size .first we are going to rip it to 21 13/16 .then we use a table saw and rip to 9 inches .then we are going to make some trim out a piece of scrap oak .then i 'm going to size it down by using a planer .then i cut the length , then we glue it , clamp it , and pin nail it .
and we 're going to talk about the work surface that you will be working on .you can work on the kitchen table or a card table like i am .you need to make sure that you cover it with a piece of cloth , a towel , something to protect the work surface that you 're working on , especially if you 're using the glue .you also might want to wear something to protect your clothing from getting the glue on , just in case you accidentally get to close to it.
okay , the last emotion that i 'm going to teach is anxious .anxious or nervous .anxious .right now , i 'm anxious .nervous , nervous .nervous , you might show it as sweat coming down your face , nervous .scared , scared .frightened , frightened .let 's review .anxious , depending on how you 're feeling you 'll want to incorporate your facial expression .nervous , nervous .scared , frightened .we 're done , good job .
in this clip we 're going to talk about hand tracing stencils on thermograph paper and the tools that are required to properly do this .thermograph paper comes in sheets like this , eight and a half by eleven , or eight and a half by fourteen inches .and it 's a little bit pricey .so once you get your artwork , you want to cut it with some scissors and make it flow .in this particular case.
what we 're going to demonstrate , talk about is the proper way to make a tensionless hitch around an object for securing the end of a rope .the purpose of the tensionless hitch is to not put a great deal of strain on the rope itself .and , we basically take the rope.
one of the reasons i use a slide to paint from .it sounds a little odd.
our newest addition is chipotle chip , which is made with the same process , but you put smoked chipotle peppers in the process , in the dough , before it gets sheeted , that 's the process .you can see it 's very distinct in color , and the key to that smoke-y flavor comes out , but the chipotle pepper has an aftertaste .you taste the chip , a second later , the chipotle pepper comes in .very distinct flavor , very different , and chipotle is very popular .chipotle is a smoked pepper that has different smoke-y aroma .it 's a deep flavor , and it 's very distinct .so , chipotle pepper is actually the jalape ?o pepper , for those that did n't know that .so , put in the vinegar and spices and gives it a very smoke-y flavor , and very distinct from jalape ?o , or other peppers .that actually goes into the process of making our chipotle .the actual pepper is put right into the dough before it gets baked to make a tortilla for our chip .you can tell from the color , the rich and the smokiness is going to come out .
all right , now , we have all the seasonings in.
so i 'm going to come over and turn on my steamer .and , it takes , usually just a few minutes to warm up , and as that 's warming up , i 'm going to get our next product which is our enzyme .and the enzyme is an exfoliant .very mild and gentle .it 's not granule or abrasive at all .it actually acts as , like , a tiny pac-man on the skin 's surface , and it eats away at the dead surface skin .really leaving the skin super soft and hydrated , and clear of any congestion .and with the combination of an enzyme and the steam , it just gives you really outstanding phenomenal results .and , this also helps prepare the skin for extractions .and , extractions is when we clean the skin out of , you know , congested pores , whether it be dirt and oil , or blackheads , or whiteheads , but this is going to help prepare that skin for that step .so that we 're not forcing anything out of the skin that 's leaving damage or scarring to the skin .so you just spread around the enzyme like so.
now this is what i like to call the one , six , five bounce .it 's not just your standard back and forth .it has a little bit more of a rock to it .the same way i had you rocking your fingers before .so here 's what you do .you go to find whatever key that you 're going to be in , e-flat .that 's where i 'm going to give you an example today .we 're going to go one , six , five .so , find the one , which is e-flat , the six which is c , the five which is going to be b-flat .so it 's one , six , five , six , one , six , five , six , one , six , five .so that 's what i 'm going to be doing with my foot .i 'm sorry.

i 'd like to talk a little bit now about hiking gear .i remember when i started hiking i used athletic shoes.
you should not use any type of artificial drying method to speed this part of the process .the use of artificial drying methods could cause the slabs to crack during firing .arrange your slabs in the furnace in a manner that allows the heat from the flame to circulate freely .separate your slabs with props made for high temperatures .place a prop at each corner of the slab .continue stacking slabs using props to maintain proper gaps for circulation .close and secure the furnace door .on the furnace door is a view finder .close or cover the view finder .failure to do so will result in significant heat loss .light the furnace to begin the firing process .firing will take 9 to 10 hours .thank you .
now let 's talk about elimination tone .that is how quickly and how efficiently your bowels can eliminate waste .let 's talk about the tone of the bowel .you know you can work out and increase the tone of your muscles .well , those are skeletal muscles .in your bowel , it 's a smooth muscle .there 's three elements that will help you with the tone in your bowel ; sodium , potassium and magnesium .let 's talk about sodium first .sodium neutralizes the gas of any food that may putrefy .some of the foods that have sodium in them are apples , beets and carrots .potassium speeds the transit time in the bowel , which is a very good thing because you want to eliminate your waste fairly quickly .it also neutralizes the acids in the bowel .so , the acids do n't destroy or irritate the bowel walls and cause pain and bleeding and infection .these foods are apples , almonds and bananas .magnesium , the third , acts like a laxative and it relaxes the bowel wall so that the waste products can move through smoothly .some of these foods are apples , brown rice and cabbage .all three are contained in apples .so , it 's true ; an apple a day can keep the doctor away if you keep your bowels moving .and it works hand in hand with bowel issues and helps eliminate waste ; wastement in the bowels .
before we begin this look you have to make sure you have all the products and tools that you need .cause this look is very specific.
so ivy , there 's different kinds of ivy .but i would say that this is a pretty typical looking , kind of an ivy design .so there are so many variations on just this one theme alone .that you could decide whether you want to paint this to look very realistic .or you want to paint it the way , i just did with a brush .but in any event , you want to think in terms of having it be , you want it to be even .in terms of how you 're placing , placing the vine .you want it to be even in terms of shapes .and you know , just think in terms of what the real , the real plant would do .how the leaves would turn towards the sun .and stay out of each other 's way .so what you 're after here is something that 's very even .and then you can go ahead .and you can add other things to the vine .maybe , it 's not an ivy vine , maybe it 's some other kind of a vine .where you can start to add flowers .so what you 're doing is , you 're , you 're making something richer and richer .and there 's also one other thing that i want to point out to .and that 's a really neat thing .a really neat idea .and it 's called grissaile , which is french word meaning gray .so the first grissaile paintings were probably done in gray .and what that means is , you 're doing something that starts to look sculpted .but it 's really only with one , with one color .so , here 's an example of a piece that i did for a calendar .and this is i would call this grissaile .because it 's face is all one color .so , it 's a matter of washes .it almost begins to it almost begins to look like a pencil drawing .pencil painting , even .and what i 've done here is i.
we 're going to get into our first stretch now .this is for our quads because once we go into the v stepping , we want to make sure that our legs are nice and stretched out because that 's a lot of the strain on the quads .that 's the muscle that you 're going to be using the most during that .so all you 're going to do is you 're going to stand up straight , grab one leg , grab one foot , bend at the knee and just pull .you want to make sure you do n't have too much of an arch in your back .you want to be right here , sitting .you want to make sure your hips are nice and square.

things you want to know about bouldering.
the first choice i have is to use paper trays like these .you can sort your paper by color in these .the only thing with doing it this way is these do take up a little bit more space .if you use this option , you 're going to want to make sure you have plenty of space to store these .you also can use plastic drawers , but again , you 're going to be looking , needing the space to store all of those .the second option we have is a paper crate , or you could use a file cabinet drawer , or something like this with file folders .you can store all of your papers in here by color , but if you have 12x12 papers , you will have to buy a crate or a file system that is made for the 12x12 , whereas this is meant for 8 1/2x11 .this saves a , a lot of space and is still very easy to access all of your papers .a third option we have is to use an envelope like this .you can pick these up at any craft store .these come in 8 1/2x11 or 12x12 .a great thing to use these for is if you want to organize your scrapbook papers by theme .for example , in here i have a school theme , so i have my papers and my stickers to keep all of my school scrapbooking things together .you then can store these in a basket or crate for easy access .
now , it is time to fold a jersey .and , we 're going to use a champion fold even if the team is n't a champion team .alright .some of you may want to hang your jerseys .because , you 're so pumped .or , you might want to put them in a frame .we 're going to fold the jersey efficiently .so , truly shake those wrinkles out of the jersey .and , then place it flat down .spread it out .and , the material is usually great .so , we can take up small space and fold it several times .because , it 's still going to be flat .so , let 's take the bottom to the top one time .and , then take it up again two times .bring that sleeve over to the center .smooth it out .but , again the material for these jerseys are great .so , it should be nice and sleek .and , take the other side to the center .and , then fold it in half .if you really want , you can fold it in half one more time for the champion fold .
the next pose in our insomnia series is the standed puppy pose .to come into this pose , you are going to start from heros pose ( verodrasana ) .you are going to take you knees as wide as your mat , but keep your toes together .you are going to walk the hands forward , reaching the fingertips as far as they can go .keep the energy moving out through the fingertips .then , you are going to drop your head .however is most comfortable for you .if you 'd like to turn your head to the side , and lay it down.
so what we are going to do is drop the fries down in the oil one at a time like we did once .( two at a time )what we are going to do is we want to keep them in the oil for about a minute and what will happen it will actually start to puff up a little bit .so while they are cooking you are going to want to make sure that they are not touching too much because if they are touching they are not cooking .one thing to be aware of is that when using duck fat when cooking french fries like this they will turn darker than normal .cause duck fat is n't really clear like a lot of other oils you can use if used vegetable oil.
training your dog to pull a cart is an interesting idea and one that would probably be useful for you to get a professional to help you to make sure that you have the proper equipment so your dog is n't injured or frightened at any point .but basically you would use a good sturdy harness for your dog that protects them while they 're being pulled , and with some good cushioning on it , you would use a harness that would n't put any pressure on their neck or their back .and initially you would put the harness on your dog , make sure that they 're comfortable and happy , maybe play with your dog , make sure that having the harness on is not a stressful experience , and then little by little you would allow them to drag something light with the harness , again , working very hard to make sure is enjoying it , lots of treats or toys or play .and then working up to pulling something like a cart .
okay .now , it 's time to put the wheel in place .okay .so once you get the new one and , again , it 's all assembled , we are going to use a couple of parts from the old one .it 's going to be this metal piece here , and actually the two screws themselves .now , the ones we discarded , because it becomes new , are these tiny , little brass lock washers here .those usually disintegrate , one of the first things to go .so all we 're going to do to make sure.
in this clip we learn how to play the actual game of derby .the pivots wear stripes on their helmets .the job of the pivot is to set the pace of the pack .so however fast the pivots are going.

so which camera should i select to buy ?there 's quite a few cameras out there .in the past , there was like around a dozen film cameras , so you could choose pentax , nikon , canon , minolta , yashica , exakta , padika , and quite a few more .but digital cameras are now made by smaller companies , and they buy their optics elsewhere in a lot of cases .so not only do you have those camera makes , you have companies like kodak , panasonic , and all different makes and models .you have over a hundred different brands of cameras and the number of models is just endless , and every year they come out with a new model .so , how do you pick a camera ?well we 're going to talk about just consumer cameras to start with .
working on those intermediate obliques with the ab roller .what we want to do , start off with those knees about hip width apart , take our ab roller in hand , both of our hands are on the grips , take our ab roller down .you want to pull that belly button in the spine , i do n't know how many times i can say that .but you always want to pull your belly button into the spine when you 're doing any type of ab or oblique exercise .and then what we 're going to do , is we 're going to roll a little bit to the right .you 're going to come out a little bit farther than what we did with the beginner .so you 're going to come out , maybe like three feet .and then you 're going to go over to the left side .and then you 're going to go back to that right side .you want to do about two sets of ten to twelve reps.again , two sets of ten to twelve reps.
i am going to show you the lady 's step for basic step .it 's 1-2-3-2-2-3-3-2-3-4-2-3.the foot positions would be left foot back , right foot to side and close left foot to right foot , then right foot forward , left foot to side and close right foot to left foot .the foot technique is toe heel , toe , toe heel , heel toe , toe , toe heel .the rise of fall of this step is down on heels , then begin to rise on step 2 and continue to rise on step 3 and at the end of step 3.

veterinarians generally start , currently , at about $ 60 ,000 a year .i think is the median salary for veterinarians across the country .in addition to that now - something that was not available when i started practicing - most veterinarians , or most veterinary clinics , start their new associates out with the base salary as well as commission meaning that they actually get a percentage , and i think 20 % is about the average , on production .back in the early 90 's.
so another performance that you can give is a solo recital .and the basic principles of recital pretty much still apply except that when you 're tuning you 're not going to have anyone to tune with you .so it 's important in the very beginning , as well as when you 're learning to tune , to really learn to tune on your own .a lot of the times you will have piano near you , in your lesson you 'll probably have a piano near you to tune with , or a tuner .but when you 're giving a recital you 're not going to be able to bring your tuner on stage , so you want to make sure that by the time that you give your recital that you really know what that a is supposed to sound like , the a that you need to play .so really making sure you practice your tuning not only with a piano and with a tuner , but also learning how to tune by ear because when you give a solo recital , when you tune you 're going to have to just hear that d minor chord in your head and just start tuning your a , and then tuning all of your other strings against the a.
romeo and juliet are lying dead on each other 's arms and we have answered that question what is going to happen to romeo and juliet .now , still , there are more things to explore .what happens to the capulets ?that 's still a dramatic question that has n't been answered .and now , we have montague and capulet , will they ever reconcile ?and the answer is it took romeo and juliet dying to bring these two enemies together .that is a dramatic question that is answered after the conflict .what happens to verona ?what happens to the other characters ?sometimes in a play , this is also revealed .in hamlet , fortinbras has returned .fortinbras has been brought into the plot .what 's going to happen with fortinbras ?is fortinbras going to be victorious in his crusade against denmark ?and at the end , when hamlet is killed , after that , horatio has his speech where he tells aught of woe.

your arms , your hands , and the club head , goes down the line longer .down the line , down the line , down the line .down the line , down the line , down the line .down the line , as opposed to a flat swing , that is much more around and around .now , one of the things that jack felt was a necessity , was staying behind the ball while he was hitting , so he would have the ball off his left heel .wide , wide , wide , stay behind the ball .his lower body went behind the ball , behind the ball , staying behind the ball , hitting the ball from behind his body .if it ever went like this , he was in a lot of trouble , if his body slid .he wanted his weight , he wanted everything to be behind the ball , and that was so important for him to be upright , and down that same line , and to stay behind the ball .
alright folks in this clip.
the teleprompting business is not for everyone .whether you start out being an operator , or become a thriving business , it can be stressful , and the work comes in seasons .especially , if you live in an area like denver , where there are definite seasons for the business .many operators have two and three freelance jobs , like script supervising .i also have another freelance job , like producing and editing .it 's the nature of the business , as they say .there are the rewards .some shows can be unforgettable with their stage design music , and ambiance .i 've made a lot of friends .i 've met a lot of interesting people , and politicians , stars , and musicians .you can work in some beautiful places , and if you 're lucky , you can even be a bit of a tourist , but to me , teleprompting really means helping a speaker , give that special retirement speech , or prompting the actor , that is doing a nonprofit commercial about needy children , or helping the corporate employee.
hi , today we are going to talk about form w-4 .the purpose of form w-4.

the next area we 're going to cover is stationary bikes .even on a slow day in a gym you can always jump up on a stationary bike and still get a good workout for cardio .what we like to do , is we like to point them so that they 're always facing the middle of the gym .even when you 're having a slow day , you can still jump on a bike and actually see what 's going on .one of the better things about sitting still and doing nothing is being able to watch , you can always learn , learn something new.
we also can add ear point for quit alcohol .so the ear points for helping stabilize the dopamine level while people quit drinking is called hypothalamus .hypothalamus is inside of this tubercles in the lower part of the ear .so this is inside of this tubercle .so that 's the hypothalamus .and it controls a lot of chemical production in the human body .and we can use this point to suppress appetite at the same time to let the brain produce more dopamine .so without alcohol people still feel pretty good .

many people commonly ask me how do you set up a plasma tv .to set up a plasma tv there 's a few basic steps .first you want to remove the tv from its packaging instead of from a secure stand .usually the weight is listed on the outside packaging of the tv .make sure that the stand you place it on has enough support to support the weight of the television set .second , you 're going to have to hook the power out and take the standard plug out of the box , plus the electric supply into the back of the tv and then into the wall .finally , you 'll have to hook up your input sources to it .there is two different cables used to..

hi , i 'm jk dooley , and we 're talking a little bit about giclee reproduction and choosing canvas to print on .and we talked about this with paper as well .a lot of times.
hi , my name is lauren and today i 'm here to discuss how a curling works .within your curling iron there are two pieces of metal which are poor conductors of heat .as the resistance builds , so does the temperature and the temperature is very even and the increase is steadily .you can adjust your temperature through your temperature gauge on your curling iron .finer hair , you 're going to want to use more of a bit of a lower temperature .coarser hair , you can use a higher temperature .your hair can handle it a bit better .as you go through your hair , you 're going to pick it up .the reason why this works and the reason why it changes is the heat actually alters the hydrogen bonds in your hair .the hydrogen bonds will help you to temporarily change the hair texture of your hair and it create from straight hair , a nice wave .there are three bonds that your hair is comprised of and that is the hydrogen bond , the salt bond , and the disulfide bond .your disulfide bond is what actually predicts your hair texture .the hydrogen bond is a temporary way , in order to break that bond down , and curl your hair if your hair is very straight .it will help to kind of give you versatility within your style and go from curly to straight and back again , and that is how curling irons work .
it 's been washed and prep the same as before trim the ends off of your carrots and then cut them in large chunks like that and then put them all into the food processor the garlic , the onions , and the celery .and we 'll process that until its fine it changes the texture of the soup a little.
another really great hint that i 'm going to give you and something you always want to keep in mind is try to avoid using black at all costs .in fact , i do n't even own any black paint .i did once , and i threw it away , because i wanted to make sure i did n't use it .because black can really destroy a painting .it can really muddy up your colors when you mix it with warm and cool colors .you want it , if you need a dark color , just go for a really condensed , really the darkest warm or cool color you have .if you 've got a red that is a really dark condensed red , try and use that , or mix it with some of the darkest blue that you have , or use the darkest blue for the black instead of black .like usually , you 're only going to need it with shading , because colors on things are n't usually that dark.
here is another style of opening that is called a trench .i just labeled it version four .the trench coat part of it is in where the jacket folds over and is off-center .this part right here , we have two pieces sewn together into one .and , it creates one whole seamless , not seamless because obviously there you have a seam .but , it is called a trench coat version of an opening because you are taking the traditional trench coat style.
our folkloric version of the egyptian walk adds a little bit of the twist and a little bit of the up and down with the hip .so we 're going to step on the right foot , bring the left foot forward this time .and plant the ball of the foot firmly on the floor .bend both knees .and now the hip is going to do both the twist and the lift .so it 's going to aim up , corners up on a diagonal up to the upper corner and then drop back down .step feet back together.
okay , a pre-bend looks like this .we have a 15th fret pick on the b string .but in this case with a pre-bend , the arrow goes straight up .there 's a `` full '' so a whole step bend .but a pre-bend , you pick the note after you bend the string .so , we 're going to bend the string then pick the note .okay .so pre-bend , we 're going to bend the note first then pick it .so , the 15th fret b string.
and i am a modern dance instructor in austin , texas.
the dime defense is a defense you 're gon na play because you are sure the offense is going to throw the football .the offense , one first indication might be that they only have the five offensive linemen .and then their gon na have their four wide receivers .now these four wide receivers can be in any combination .got your quarterback , and you also got your running back .now that running back may end being a fifth wide receiver .they take running back out of the game , then they add another wide receiver .so what you have is any empty back field .which means there is no threat to run the football , unless the quarter back is going to run it , you do n't have a back back here .but you do have five receivers which is the biggest threat the offense is going to have .and you have to defend those guys .
today i 'm going to teach you how to draw graffiti names .now , of course , there 's a infinite number of styles with graffiti , but we 're going to go with ...we 're going to with one here just to show you some basics .most of it is about names , so i 'm going to use my nickname , shatter .and , i 'm going to do this a little taller and thinner .just draw some basic letters to start with .you can draw it really lightly , go back and erase it later .or if you go over it in ink , then you can more easily erase the letters .and once you 've got your general arrangement , then you can get crazy with it .what i 'm going to do is , i 'm going to do every other letter big , every other letter small .and you can get really wild .we 're going to make this sort of look serrated .it 's always hard to draw a curve against your hand , so if you move the page around , it 'll work with your body better .and i 'm just going to do about four letters here .feel free to get your proportions , your angles , all of 'em odd , because graffiti is all about expression .so , then we 'll have a big a.
swinging the other way not knowing where the other one is .they 've been doing this for at least five years .seven years old , ten years old .boys , let 's see you chip to that hole with that seven iron .alright , that 's a little too hard .ok nice and easy gant .good , there 's a good one .a hair short but good .gage beauty you have a chance to get in , nice .alright leading one nothing .but this is a great practice .look at that little chip and run , instead of using a wedge .alright , you hit a little behind that one.
in this clip we 're going to show that you can thrust with the sabre , as well as cut with the sabre .you defend the same way and you always attack yourself after you 've made your defense .it 's very important to do that , because most of the time the attacker will continue and hit , and if you do n't make that attack you wo n't get your point .now , we 're going to demo .you 're ready to demonstrate this ?okay .now he 's in his guard position ,right ?i 'm going to cut .ah !he 's using that blocking , which is not effective .it 's only effective if you 're real good .the thing about sabre , and a thing about any weapon in terms of fencing is that everybody thinks they know the easy way to do things , but they 're really doing it the hard way .so you have to listen to your coach .do it the way they teach you to do it .then , later you can modify it to your own taste .understand that ?give me twenty .ah , ha ha ha !see ?i.
i 'm going to talk to you about how to survive a kitchen remodel .and one thing to keep in mind that when you remodel your kitchen or any remodeling job in your house , usually it takes a little bit longer than what you plan it to .so always keep that in mind when you take your first approach .now in surviving a kitchen remodel the better plan that you do on the front end , then the better it 's going to go as you go through the process .now first thing is that when you actually get in to the remodel you want to try to isolate your room as much as you can by hanging plastic over all the openings so that you can limit any dust and debris from demolition within the kitchen area that you 're working with .now also you have to keep in mind that as you go through certain stages , particularly when you 're replacing cabinet , replacing appliances , that you 're going to be without this area to use for a while .so , you may want to work with your contractor to set up a temporary location for perhaps a range , your refrigerator , so that you can still have use of those items even while you 're waiting for the new ones to be installed .now most ranges require special electrical.
: here are some different glaze examples of the pieces we have in pottery .you can see how the glazes change over the different clay bodies themselves .we have a white clay , our throwing clay , a sculpture clay and then two different slips , our black slip and white slip with the rutile gold over the top of it .there are lots of other surfaces here with different glazes ; different results to highlight whatever kind of design that you put onto your piece .here , i have two of the finished platters that i 've made .this is a black glaze that i 've put on here and here 's another platter with the shino glaze on top of it where we 're highlighting that spiral that we put in our pot earlier .so there 's all different kinds of surfaces , all different kinds of glazes to put on there .
now that you 've got your gear and ready to snowboard you need to have a good time out here and get from point a to point b on your snowboard , which i 'm going to be explaining to you .you need to learn a little bit about the bindings and the chair lift ; just all around getting up and down the mountain and having a good time with it .before i teach you how to strap in your bindings you definitely need to take a look at the mountain and know what 's around you .know what you need to stay clear of .know where the jumps are , the rails are .where there 's a lot of traffic flow .maybe if you 're not so confident in hitting the jumps and hitting the stuff you can go off to the side and take a nice run off the side of the mountain .instead of running into people and getting involved in everyone around you .just take a smooth run by yourself and get to know the feel of the mountain .
a circle is always a really good , a circle is very common in logos , it just has a nice smooth fill .well instead of making an actual boarder , i went to the layers.
so you want to remove some facial hair .a lot of the areas that are involved in this process are your lip , usually your sideburns or your cheek or your fuzzy , a lot of women have extra fuzzy stuff that they do n't want to deal with and then some chin hair .sometimes there are one or two , sometimes it 's enough to wax .so you need to decide , do you want to do this , do you have enough hair that you want to wax or do you just want to use tweezers and a mirror ?do you want to invest in the , if you just have a few hairs , then you probably just want to use a tweezer and a mirror .if you have enough hair , then you probably want to invest in a wax , whether you choose to do a hard wax or a soft wax , you need to invest in that .and then there are several products that are involved in that investment and some upkeep.
we are going to do the half court diagonal game.
this cocktail is called the breathalizer .this is one of those things that would be good after dinner if you did n't have peppermints on you or did n't have gum on you.

for our cake today , i used a special doll mold cake , that you can get in a cake decorating store or craft store .and , but i recommend , that instead of just using the doll cake , they tell you to put enough batter for a two layer cake , i recommend also making a ten or a nine inch round layer cake .what happens when you fill these molds , it domes up.
so here is our second sock with the snout cut out of it .and so out of this sock we are going to cut two arms and a tail and.
here we 're going to discuss a minor third interval , where we take the major scale and we go from the first note up a whole step , up another whole step to the third note of a major scale .now , a minor third refers to taking this third note and lowering it by a half step , the same way we lowered the second down to a minor second .so , we 've got the first note , the second note , the third note of a major scale .bring it down one for a minor third .now , anywhere on the neck , if you play one note and you go up three frets , that would be referred to as a minor third interval .now , you can also do that between two strings .you could start on this note and go , instead of here.
another element of your home office that could easily be overlooked .most rooms , home offices , in someone 's house , apartment or condo is only going to have.
so , now i 'm going to be showing you how to do , legs up the wall .it 's a variation , and a more restorative pose of shoulder stand for women in their first trimester of pregnancy .often , during pregnancy , particularly in the first trimester , you do n't want to practice any inverted poses , like head stand or hand stand .but this is a softer variation of an inversion , where you 're not lifting the hips above the belly .where you 're doing , is you 're just leaning the legs against the wall .so , go ahead and come onto your sticky mat , have a nice solid wall or mirror , or something nearby that you can brace yourself up against .and bring you right hip to the wall .go ahead , and come on to your back , as you swing your hips around , and draw the legs up the wall .if you need to , you can re-adjust , and walk the hips closer to the wall , and then separate the legs , as wide as feels comfortable .draw the arms down by the side , the palms facing up , and start to breath nice and deeply , from the belly , all the way up to the tops of the lungs .drawing your legs up the wall , allows gravity to help your veins pump all that wonderful blood back to the heart , allowing the heart to distribute oxygen back out to the rest of the body .it also helps to calm the nervous system .it 's a wonderful pose to do before you go to bed at night .and , just make sure you allow everything to soften here .try to do more , by doing less in this pose .and this is also a wonderful pose that helps circulation in the lower extremities , so just see if you can breathe deeply .and , this is a wonderful pose that you can do , after your first trimester , in your second and third trimester , with something that props up your back , so you 're more in the position of a v.but , it 's a nice way to give the feet and the ankles , and the legs a break .when you 've stayed in the pose for a minute or so , breathing deeply , and you 're ready to come out , go ahead and bend the knees .and you 're going to go ahead and drop the knees , back to one side , maybe walking the knees down the wall , and just take a moment , in the fetal position , on your side , and take a few breaths there , and when you 're ready , go ahead , and press yourself up to a nice soft cross legged position .and that is legs up the wall , for women in their first trimester of pregnancy .
so we are going to have to make a substitute for it .what you need is regular milk and vinegar .we are going to take out measuring cup.
thus far our painting has been broad , broad brush strokes .but , now we 're going to shift gears and go down to the detail side of the painting .and that 's going to be with a very small round brush which we 're going to fill in these dog tags .every doggie should have them .this is very much more in terms of finesse detail work than the things we 've done so far .try to make that your painting stays in the basic shape of the circular object here .it does not have to be perfect , but you should n't have big squiggles going out over the gray , either .continue to apply this around and then once you 've filled this in.
today we 're going to be doing what 's called knitting backwards .this is a really fun technique because normally when we were doing a stockinet stitch , which is what this is , we would knit down to the end of the row and then we would turn our work and purl back .with knitting backwards we 're going to be purling but from the right side .so you won ?t be turning your knit work over to accomplish your purl .i 've knit down to the end of this row.
right now we 're going to be learning an exercise for the finger vibrato and again i want you to put down your bow and just take your violin .you 'll find that it 's somewhat similar to the hand vibrato exercise except this one and your finger.
in this video , i 'm going to be talking about what i call the horizontal hop .now to do this you have to be pretty good at doing the horizontal circles , like this , and you have to have at least tried doing a throw , like that .a horizontal throw , and back into horizontal circles .something like that .so you need to be pretty good at both of those .now , i 'll just show you what the horizontal hop looks like first , and then we can start talking about it .that 's what it looks like .let 's see if we can get a longer run .something like that .so what 's actually happening , is i 'm getting a horizontal spin going like this , as fast as i can , and then i 'm just hopping the stick from the very center of the crystal stick straight up and down , with short little throws , so that the tassels can spin.
as we talked about a little bit earlier the demi sec.
hey let 's talk about testing your gear .there is a lot of gear you need to do bike touring effectively .you will have a bike that is loaded down with a lot of gear , you will probably have a front rack like this , you know , a handle bar bag , and rear bags.
so when you see that you 've done something incorrectly in a barrel run or if you watch a tape of yourself doing something incorrectly , use that as a learning tool but try not to beat yourself up with it and just move on .so then next thing you want to do then instead of focusing on that mistake is focusing on what you are going to do correctly instead .so instead of focusing on the mistake focus on what the correction would be .so instead of going through and saying okay.
ok let 's play the bass drum on beats one , two , the and of two , the and of three and the and of four under the rock beat .ok let 's break this down to get a better idea of what 's going on with the bass drum .i like to think of this beat splitting it in two ways .first of all playing the bass drum on one and two , simple enough .and then after the second beat we switch to the off.
we do n't want to teach first aid today .no , no , we 're taking about monster toast .so , when it 's cooking actually before you push it on , i actually take the toaster oven and put it back on the shelf away from the kids .it also has the element of surprise , because you like to have the finished product as a nice surprise .and when it 's too close , kids are curious .they 're going to be touching the glass , touching the top , they move around , and you do n't want to worry about it .i do n't know how much your liability insurance is , but you do n't want to tap into it .so , move your toaster oven out of the way .okay , the other thing , too , this is a good time for the clean up .yes , it 's another teachable moment , cleaning up .when you have all these things on the table , you 're going to want to clear the table .so , tell the kids , `` hey !now it 's time to clean up .let 's see who can follow directions .
our next step is going to be to set this router up to make a 1/4 of an inch deep cut .i have the router set at 0.
alright we 're talking about the canon 40d again , and we 're moving from the basic modes to the more advanced operation modes of the camera .canon kind of has separated most of the modes into two areas .one is the basic zone which is on the lower half of this dial here .most of these basic zones have an icon that is , looks very different from the creative zone modes .the creative zone is indicated by letters for the most part .the creative zone includes a program mode which automatically sets your exposure settings with iso speed , aperture and shutter speed , but a lot of other options that were n't available , available to you in the basic zone are now available to you in the program mode .the next mode is the shutter priority mode.
so when your pasta garland has already dried , then it 's time to put it on the christmas tree .let 's find maybe a place here .and then you just hang it over like that .it will be a lovely decoration .and of course , if you have a longer one , you can put it all around your christmas tree and that will be beautiful .why is it good fun ?because if you have a little bit older children , you can make the christmas garland all together because it 's a good preparation for the children .they really look forward to christmas and it would be very nice for them to make a christmas decoration or to make a christmas garland that you can actually put on the christmas tree so they can wonder at it all around christmas .as they get older , you can see the improvement throughout the years .obviously , they want to make the same christmas decoration at the age of three that they 'll make at the age of 12.and it 's a nice way of showing it on your christmas tree and put all the decorations around it .they can also surprise you , and also while you are busy in the kitchen making the christmas lunch or christmas dinner , you can occupy your children with this easy-going task .obviously , do n't give the sharp needle for your child because they can hurt themselves .but they can easily use the paint .they can easily use the wool .they can easily use the pasta .they are not dangerous at all .of course , some supervision is important here , but if you supply them with a place where they can make a mess , then it 's not a real problem .and it 's a good free time activity before christmas .you can just sit down , listen to some christmas music and christmas songs , christmas carols , and then you can do your own art .so have a merry christmas .
alright , and now that you 're comfortable spinning your poi backwards with each hand , let 's put them together and spin them both backwards .again , like with the front , we 're keeping the poi rotating both at the same speed , and parallel to each other .this is actually a little bit easier than it , or it 's a little bit harder than it looks .but , if you are having troubles with this at first , do n't be discouraged , just keep practicing and you will see that you will improve very quickly to be able to do this .and , notice if you feel more comfortable spinning them forwards , or backwards , some people feel more comfortable spinning them backwards , and find it more challenging to spin them forwards , and other people vise-versa .while most people feel most comfortable holding the hands at waist level , you can also start experimenting with rotating your arms at different heights .
in this clip we 're going to do backside 180s .so , if you 've never done a backside 180 , start some place small like do them off of a roller or on flat ground .and then you can step up to like jumps or the sides of rails , or we 're going to hit this right here.
ok , covering the court with one step , i want to be able to get to the back of the front-court , the mid-court , and the front of the back-court .so , if i 'm under extreme pressure , i do n't have time to really do anything except step and react .so , this type of movement drill , i want you to practice this.
right now we 're going to do a painting of a windmill .it 's probably in a mediterranean country .it 's got some warm colors in it and the paints we 're going to use are going to be primary red , which is basically naphthol red or cadmium red .we could even use permanent rose , which is a darker red .cobalt blue and yellow .plus we 'll need pane 's gray as well .brushes .we 're going to need like a number ten brush with a fine point on it .it needs to have a fine point .when you wet it , it needs to come to a sharp point like this .and this one is synthetic and natural kolinsky red sable .you can use anything from a size six round to a size fourteen , but i think a ten is the right size for this painting which is going to be six by nine .
stepping back with the left foot , bringing the arms overhead , warrior i has .give yourself enough room in your stance ; your right and left foot hipbone distance apart , so you can get the hips to square towards the front of the room .that 's key .if your heels are too lined up towards each other or in the same plane , and your hips tend to get squished in the sacrum .exhale into warrior ii , arms extending .a nice balance here of muscle energy with a releasing outward of the heart energy .so hugging to center line , yes , but also letting go of some of that tension and stress , especially in the shoulders , and letting the arms lengthen .now come , now straighten out the right leg ; turn all ten toes towards the side wall , and then go into warrior ii , same side , or opposite side , so the left knee is bending , right outer edge of the foot pressing into the floor , beautiful .and then into warrior.
and we 've tenderized them.

woman or girl ?almost the same as a man or boy .stars the same way .sometimes you can play around with the noses .here is a different kind of nose that what the man .give her a little bit of a neck .we will come down .the arms are the same .hair do any kind of hair you like .you always see little girls drawing hair that goes like this .whoop and whoop bump .that is the easiest , you do n't have to put the details in there if you do n't have time .coming down from the tops of the arms .kind of come in a little bit instead of going straight down .a waist and of course the designation of woman is dress .although you can draw your woman wearing whatever you like and show a little bit of that bottom .the ankles , shoes put a little bit of a heel on the shoe .a little detail on the dress .you can put a collar on the shirt .she is wearing a nice blouse .a little bit of button down .and there you have it .there is is woman and one last final touch some lipstick very easy , very cute .you can even put a little blush and here you go .girl just as easy .same exact thing .not going to let that girl wear high heals .she is too young .and she 's ready to go to school.

i  m going to show you , on this particular monitor , how to setup for a particular type of workout .remember , you turn on the monitor on first of all , or just start puling .i  m going to do a workout that  s based on time .we  re going to do intervals .we  re going to press the time button.
and what actually is the best way to deal with a relationship breakup ?such input , you really need to get busy , you really need to deal with two things , the pride that you feel , the hurt and also the `` void '' in your life .the best thing to do is to take stock who you are as an individual , your inventory.
so you want to start off with lengthen your spine , you 're going to lengthen through the crown of your head , no different than when you 're doing your standing poses , and you 're going to relax your shoulders .we 're going to use an inhale to extend your left leg up to the sky .and you 're probably going to start off with having a strap , or a rope , or take your husband 's tie .you want to be able to have ; i want you to be able to hold onto the loop , and not the tail .so the way that you 'll determine the size of your loop is the strap goes on the ball of your foot , and then you want to be able to have your arms straight , so that the weight of your hand is holding up your leg .so you 're not holding onto the strap and pulling , creating more tension in your shoulders than you 're releasing .you 're going to actively reach the heel as though it could touch the ceiling tile .
it 's where you 're looking at your crowd.
and mainly , a couple of reasons as far as how to prevent a toothache until you can see your general dentist.
i 'll jump through one more time , once from each direction .
they 're impeccably dressed in bright , bold colors like red and yellow , much like hulk hogan .they usually arrive at a function a few minutes late ( iman the model ) , and it 's not that they ca n't tell time , they 've got a beautiful gold watch , they just want to make sure everybody notices when they walk in the room , and they 're not opposed to a drum roll flourish .both the men and the women have a feline quality to themselves , and they normally wear their hair swept back like a big lion 's mane , much like loni anderson and mae west .and some will go so far as to dress in animal prints , emulating their lion totem .they walk into the room like they own the joint , standing straight and tall like haile selassie .they are regal kings ( barack obama and napoleon ) and queens ( madonna ) of the zodiac .they truly believe that the sun is the center of the solar system , and since they are ruled by the sun , they think everybody in the world exists to orbit their star and to be darned grateful for the opportunity to do so .they throw the best temper tantrums in the zodiac ( danny bonaduce ) , while showing their displeasure , and they 'll punish you by removing their glowing presence from your life .so that 's how to spot a leo .it 's better living through astrology .i 'm janet sciales , the star goddess .
the line is just for a guideline to give you something to work from .okay , other piece of the mouth , coming off of here .see i got to work with my mouth here because i do n't have so much chin .if i had more chin.
i have now played through new of b flat blues and gone through the chord progressions , outlines , and different chord .and shown how they are used in a common head and how to create a solo from them and tips to use a solo .i will now go through and play a traditional blues style playing the head and then also playing a solo and then playing the head again .so i will now play this using the chord changes on the piano .i hope you have learned some good ideas to play through a solo for the blues and that you had fun enjoying this .feel free to play over and transcribe any of the solos that i have used .here is freddy the freeloader and improvised solo .i hope you have enjoyed learning the blues in b flat on the flute .
so , decide what you can do well .decide what your staff is doing well .do n't try to do things that your staff is n't trained for , because you are going to burn yourself .sooner or later , somebody is going to complain about it and find out the staff was not qualified to do this .they just tried it and it does n't work .the other thing is monitoring attendance .if you monitor attendance properly and if you do n't act in a rash way ; if you do it over a period of time , you have a good idea.
in this video segment series , we 're going to talk about blink 182 's `` adam 's song '' .let 's take a look at the guitar .we 're going to go over every part on this song.
first thing , the basic thing this whole part this piece of wood here , is called the body of the guitar .the wood that is attached to the body where you play , where you put your fingers down , this is the neck of the guitar .this part up here is called the head or headstock .this is your tail piece as you can see here.
so before we continue with some of these ideas i 'll mention that most of the ideas we are looking at in these series focus on playing in four four or at least groups of twos and fours.
basically , how to develop stage presence .so , right now we 've got one of our performers.
one k body shaping program.
another thing a dealer needs to know is called splitting cards , so for example , if a player has two cards of the same num , numerical value , so for instance , the player here has nines , they will have to let the dealer know that they want to split those nines .so let  s say again , the players bet a hundred dollars and they say ,  i would like to split.
you pretend you 're like an ambulance siren or a police siren and you do something like this .when you do that , you should probably feel tingly within your nasal cavity , and again , very relaxed in the throat area .so let 's try that again .as you 're doing the siren , you should feel , again , that air passing through the throat section and then going through the nasal cavity and out .and again , it should be very relaxed .
okay , let 's put our fingertips , let 's interlock our fingers here together and then , reach up and stretch up high .so , we want to rise up out of the hips , extending ourselves up , and then , from here , simply rock to one side and then the other .and what we 're trying to do , rising up out of the hips , is stretch the whole upper body back and forth , and once you have this gentle swing motion going , let 's go deep into our breath and expand the lungs .breath in and out .your feet are rooted in the ground , and your upper body 's moving as if you 're a tree planted in the ground , and the wind is blowing the top of the tree back and forth .
so if you just want a cheap pair this is just a little regular work glove , a little jersey glove they call it.
it 's very easy to do.
okay , welcome .i 'm chita johnson and i 'm going to teach you how to be a print model .the first thing you need to know are poses .and this is pose number one in any model 's repertoire .you 're going to point the right toe , pull it inward to the left foot or left toe on your left foot .so , i 'm going to do that again .the right toe pulls into the left foot with the big toe .and i want you to take your body , let your thumbnails be forward , stomach pulled in and twist the hips from right to left , just a little bit , so that you create a broad to narrow image .this image is very important in professional modeling because you want to be broad at the shoulder , narrow at the waist and then shadow out with the legs .so i 've got my thumbnails facing forward , my knee is forward as well , a little twist in my hip.
so to be successful with anything you really want to picture yourself being successful .imagine it in your head so with food if you have some goals maybe you want to set a goal that you want to eat a healthier diet .picture yourself eating healthy food and planning for it .that way when you setup to start doing it you can already somewhat have some steps in your head on how you are going to be successful .if you want to loose weight think about how you 're going to eat healthy foods and eat smaller portions and think about how you are going to look when you loose weight and how you are going to feel better .maybe you can even control your blood sugars if you have diabetes or decrease your chance in having heart disease .so the main point is just that whatever your goal is , whatever reason that you want to eat a healthy diet make sure that you picture yourself being successful .
i 'm going to demonstrate a 4 stroke roll .a 4 stroke roll is.
with our ring finger , same spot .another thing to note is that when i 'm playing.
a arts , i 'm a freelance illustrator slash fine artist i graduated from art school.
in this series , we will be focusing on poses and postures that will be opening the chest and the hips .these are both areas of the body that tend to be pretty tight in americans .we often have jobs where we are sitting at a desk all day long .or , we are standing for long periods of time .both of these activities create tightness across the front of the chest and also in the hips , because we are not usually sitting in a position such as this as we are doing these things .so , these poses will create length across the front of the chest .open the muscles in the hips , and strengthening the opposing muscles as well .we will start our series with a three part breath , which is a basic breath , but it allows more oxygen into the lungs .it allows the diaphragm to work more efficiently .so , focusing again on the chest , we are going to be bringing more oxygen in and letting go of emotional baggage in our hips .so , let 's get started .
so we get a lot of cobalt blue on the brush and just work that in .
we are not going to apply a solid base layer not at first .this is going to be building up .what we are going to do is is we are just going to apply the light brown.
as we progress to the 1800 and 1900 handbags really where looking popular , they where really to off .in 1900s icons such as grace kelly and jackie o really popularize the handbags .even today if you open any magazine you would see countless celebrities with handbags or a hot bag of the season or a chanel , gucci , or a prada or some major stylist fads .bags today are about statues , they are symbolic to you know high class people and just celebrities and again as i was saying bags are statues symbols .you would see madonna carrying the latest chanel bag or sienna miller or some major celebrity.
this is how the for the ladies step .it looks like this .slow , quick quick .once more , slow , quick , quick .it 's not a very easy figure for the lady , but if you have learned it , it will be much more easier .so i will tell you the foot positions now .the right foot should go forward , and then turn on the ball of right foot and in the mean time close left foot to right foot , a little bit back .and then you step forward with left foot and then turn on the ball of left foot and in the mean time you close right foot to left , a little bit backwards , without wait .so once more , step forward with right foot , turn on the ball of right foot , close left foot to right foot without wait , then left foot forward , turn on the ball of left foot , close right foot to left foot without wait .and the foot technique for this step would be heel turn on the ball of right foot , inside of the ball.
i 'm going to put the falafel in the pita.
i 've been in the personal training field for over thirteen years .i 've started two gyms , one of which is my current cross fit tucson .and i 've worked in the physical therapy and rehabilitation fields .in this group of exercises we 're going to going over upper body pushing movements .and there are three planes that we really want to cover .there 's the overhead plane , where we 're pushing away from ourselves in the vertical plane ; there 's the horizontal plane , where we 're pushing away from ourselves this way ; and then there 's the downward plane , where we 're pushing ourselves or the weight , down in that direction .so we cover all three major directions that the upper body moves in.
alright , and in the next step what we 're going to do is go ahead and assemble our book .that means we 're going to go ahead and pull all of our scored lines together.
in this clip we 're going to talk about the hunter character class .once you 've chosen a realm and a faction and a race you choose your class .in this case we 're talking about hunters , one of the , a main advantages to playing a hunter character is the ability to use pets .hunters use pets to help them in combat , for example , my hunter character has his pet here , is a pet pig .now i can use the pig to attack other monsters which allows me to stand back and do damage from a distance .for example , a hunter is a very proficient with ranged weapon like bows and guns and things like that and letting the pig do a lot of the damage for you allows you to do other specialized things from a distance .another advantage to playing in a hunter character is that hunters do a lot of ranged damage , they have their bows and guns .where the , which allows them to take less damage from creatures near bye .they are also another good class to solo , which means playing with by yourself rather than with a group because you have the pig there for example or you could have any kind of pet you wanted really , you have the advantage of having a built in tank character that you just bring along with you which gives you the opportunity to fight a lot of creatures.
okay now let 's make these strawberries .we 've already punched two little hearts .we 've got two little stars .of course you could always just cut out the shapes with scissors , and you know you do n't have to worry about them being perfect .they can be kind of rustic because , it 's sort of a rustic project .so first we 're going to take our glue stick.
the pelvic hip tuck and drop is a real nice way to accent a specific movement and a specific sound in your music .let 's start with the feet slightly apart , the knees are going to stay soft , pull your bellybutton in , lift your chest and relax your shoulders .so we 're going to allow the pelvic motion to go forward and back , and it 's all going to be right here in your hip .the abdomen is going to stay engaged the whole time , even when you 're letting it come forward , doing the drop part of it .do n't let your stomach just relax and go blah , you do n't want to do that .you want to be nice and neat and tucked , be sure to keep the chest lifted so that you do n't end up getting this movement here .keep those shoulders still because what you 're not moving is what makes the dance look so good , not what you 're moving .so , we 're going to just keep doing it , repeating it , drilling it , getting it.
now , i am going to show you another classic step .it 's called hip drop kick .you are going to have the same position as the hip drop in the diagonal facing the audience .the audience is always in front of you .you are going to turn your body to the diagonal .you are going to tart the drop that i showed you already .the movement is like you are about to sit on a chair .then , you are going to incorporate a kick with the sit .now , i 'm going to do it in tempo .you can have different tempos ; you can have two counts or.
a very effective strike for women 's self-defense , can be seen from having two hands grabbed .once again , it 's difficult for me to get my hands involved in strikes , because they 're being held .my feet are free , but sometimes it 's easier to close the gap with your entire body .so , i 'm going to strike with my knee this time .now , one of the most standard techniques in women 's self-defense is the strike to the groin .and while that is a fairly good target , it is purely a target of opportunity .i say that because , it 's very easy for a man to defend against a strike to the groin .additionally , there are other points near that area that cause a greater degree of dysfunction and pain , than a strike to the groin would .and , a point we 're going to work on.
hi i 'm ty brown with dogbehavioronline.com .we 're here in riverton , utah today teaching you how to train a dog .the topic of today 's discussion is teaching your dog how to protect .now this is the only type of training that should be undergone with a professional trainer somebody that knows how to train a dog for this type of thing .if it is done by somebody that does n't know exactly how to do it you can run the risk of hurting your dog , hurting yourself and having a big liability on your hands and so make sure to consult with a qualified professional before undertaking some type of training like this .there are two drives that we use when we train a dog to protect .we use prey drive which is the dogs natural instinct to run , grab , and catch a prey object , in this case maybe a sleeve or a whole bite suit.

alright , now we 're going to get our rice ready .depending upon how many people you 're going to feed depends on how many cups you 're going to put in .we like to put half a cup for every mouth you 're going to feed .if there 's 5 people that 's 5 half cups .this is 3 , 4 , 5 , and actually i think we 're going to go ahead and go for 6 because i think a few of us are going to want seconds .what the heck , let 's go for 7 because this is going to be good .alright , this is the right everybody .take a look at it .sometimes there 's black ones , sometimes there 's ones that are no good.
choosing a type of balance is sometimes demanded by what you 're doing .if you 're going to do a kaleidoscope or something , then you 're probably going to have to make it in the center of the page .and , as i said before , symmetry is about formality .it can create a very definite statement , i mean , you ca n't get around this .you 're very clear about what this is , it hits you , it 's simple , and it works very well using up the center of the page and being symmetrical .but symmetry can also create a very `` quiet '' kind of feel , this is a little bit off , it 's not exactly on center , but it 's enough on center because we 've got this very strong point here .but it leaves a very `` quiet '' sense that you would n't get if you can imagine moving this person over here , and moving everything over.
if you have stains around the house from you tracking dirt in back and forth on the grout , and you 'd like to clean it , here 's a few ways you can do it .first thing you 're going to need.
wall squats can be done using the stability ball behind your back .you start with the ball at your lower back , and go ahead and bring your feet out , so that you 're at an angle .adjust the ball so that it 's right in that nice arch of your lower back , always engaging the abs .you want to make sure that when you bend down , that your knees are over the ankles .so if it turns out that your knees are over your toes , you want to make sure that your feet come out even a little bit further , okay ,so that 's good alignment .and what we 're going to do is wall squats in three different positions , so we 're going to take a nice inhale , and down ; exhale , squeeze the glutes , pushing against the heels and come up ; inhale , bend down , exhale , engage the abs , squeeze the glutes , push against the heels , pick up the toes if you can , and come up .the second position is to go ahead and latterly rotate the feet , you 'll need to bring them a dash closer together , take a nice inhale , and bend the feet down ; exhale , pushing from the heels , feeling it in here , inhale bend .so we 're kind of getting a back massage while we 're working our legs ; exhale up .and the final position is medially rotating the feet , so we 're working the inner part of the quadriceps , go ahead ; and it 's called the femoral muscles , go ahead and take a nice inhale , and bend the knees ; now i should put my feet out to make sure they 're aligned with the ankles , and exhale , squeeze up ; inhale bend the knees , still staying on the heels , exhale up .we want to stay off the toes because that engages the quadriceps , we 're as the heel is going to engage the back of the leg .and those are wall squats .
and the egg wash , again , is milk , a pinch of salt and egg yolk .once in a while a piece of white gets in there.
there are a lot of ways to glaze pottery .obviously you need to have it bisque fired first .you can dip the pieces into buckets of glaze that 's already been created .you can create glazes yourself .there 's recipes everywhere out there , especially on the internet , and you can always use applications like brushes .brushes come in a wide range of shapes , materials , thickness of hair , also in the horsehair which are really nice , delicate brushes that give you that really thin edge .my favorite one .wide application surfaces.
you know , you have the basic layup , and then you have a variation of cool ways to shoot a layup as well .one way is called the finger roll .hi , i 'm travis , and i 'm going to show you how to shoot that -- how to shoot the finger roll .now , when you 're shooting a finger roll , you have a number of ways that you can do it , but before you get to the basket .but the basic -- the basics are once you get to the basket , and you get yourself into position to shoot that layup , that finger roll.
one common mistake to make while crocheting is to not crochet the last stitch in your row .you get to the end.
our focus right now is in the post .how to defend the post .there 's several ways you can defend a post , and again a lot of this comes back to knowing your particular player .if this post player is very strong on the right side , and he likes to catch the ball , and he likes to drop step to the baseline , one thing we 're going to try to do with our defense is take that away from him .so what we 're going to have our defender do -- go ahead and post up here.
so with bachata you want to start with the most basic step first and rhythm .here 's what it looks like ( dancing )so breaking it down.
okay , take your last piece of wire .now you need to make your final connection from here to the end of the switch .so what you 're going to do just going to make that little hook easiest way , unscrew this , tighten it .now you put the other one through .now you can see you got your connection going .you got your switches on both ends connected .you got your battery connected also to your light bulb .and this is , notice , that this is still free standing .and we 're going to rely on the electrons going through the wire and making contact .an electromagnetic contact with this piece of tin .this is were you 're going to get that sound ( dit , dit , dit , dit ) and at the same time , this light bulb should go , wew , wew , wew , every time you touch the switch .
of course , as we all make our talks , probably , the most traditional problem that we have , is in dealing with the question about having an interesting topic .everybody wants to have an interesting topic .and people like to hear about interesting things .and of course , when you have something like that , it 's really great .because everybody is right on the edge of the seat , listening .but then , there 's the opposite problem .a lot of times , we might have topics that they 're just totally , boring to us .this creates a problem .i 'll just give you one , extreme example .let 's say , i 'm a speaker .and i 'm just really bored with my topic .and i just you know , i come in and .well , o.k .i think that this topic about the swimming pool .well , yeah , it 's kind of , interesting .and i think that we could probably solve it , in the end .and you know , we talked about that before with the non skid surface .how does that communicate ?at the same time , when you start doing something like that , where you 're starting to communicate emotion , you know , what happens ?even the audience starts to mirror your emotion .if you 're going to be bored , what 's going to happen with your audience ?oh !and here we have like ,i 'm talking to my people , out here .and i 'm trying to communicate .and i 'm you know ,it just , it 's really a boring topic .now here we have a clue .you 'd better be looking at your audience .and i 'm looking out there.
so , when we talk in terms in advanced keet kune do , it 's not necessarily the techniques are any different.
so we are just going to tare these pieces , it do n't need to be the same size or the same shape .i 'm going to be using 3 different colors to decorate my flower pot .once i have my torn pieces i 'm going to take my decoupage solution which you can get at your craft store.
today i 'm going to teach you how to replace a door .if you have a damaged door or a door that is swollen or warped and no longer fits.
this is not a simple pose , but , for beginners we 're going to show you a nice way to get into it .starting in four limbs staff pose , out from your hands and knees , extend the fingers , the feet back to the back edge of your mat.
i am starting to just say ; `` well you know i have these what can i do with this as a picture ? ''so , you know you just keep going , this way i am going to sort of keep my idea of what might be happening and where you can go from there .here i have my piece of paper.
the next thing that i want to talk about is your proper lighting and heating , for a crested gecko .crested geckos are a tropical species , they do n't need as much heating as say.
moving on to half lotus ; now many people are familiar with the traditional yoga pose , called lotus pose where both feet are on opposite sides .that is very difficult to do .it takes many years of practice in order to do that .so we 're going to start with a half lotus and even then , be mindful of your knees because this is a comprising position for the knees .to help with that , we 're going to keep our ankle flexed .let 's take the right leg first .flexing that ankle that creates a nice firm foundation from the sole of the foot into the knee .we 're going to slowly bring that foot up on to the thigh keeping the foot flexed .bringing the heal deep into the crease where the leg meets the body .sitting up nice and tall .and if we feel pain in through the knee , we want to release this because again this is a comprising position for knees that are susceptible to injury .
the next board type we are going to be talking about is free ride board .this board differs greatly from the previously mentioned alpine board on a number of levels .first of all the board has nose and a tail to it whereas the alpine only has a nose .this board has a semi-directional shape to it as opposed to the alpine 's directional which means it can be ridden either way.
so , we 're learning the bachata partnering .the basic steps .in the last clip we did the side to side basic , now we 're going to do the front and back basic .we 're staying in a closed position and we are going to start with the side to side basic so you can see the difference .here 's the side to side .it goes one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .front and back , five , six , other side again .side , three , four , five , six.
this will be more like a soul kind of thing from maybe the fifties or sixties with a strut style .i 'm just strutting the chord and following what ?s in.
now we need a way to seal the back to the picture frame itself .so the way i do this , i 'm going to be using some metal fasteners , the easiest way to close up the two pieces of cardboard .and , before i do that , i 'm going to have to make some points on the picture frame as to where i 'm going to make the holes , and where i 'm going to put the fasteners inside .now the reason why i 'm going to be using the fasteners is because they can open up and close easily .so , therefore , i can change the picture any time i want .i just open up the fastener and take off the back .so i make my points .i 'm going to be making four points , one on each side of the picture frame .and once i have those points i go and take a sharp object , i 'm using an x-acto knife , and make a hole .and that will be the point where i can insert the gold metal fasteners .even though the gold metal fasteners are going to be covered up with some masking tape and some regular color paint , i do n't want to put too many because it makes it harder to do the project having to cover them all up .so i just put one on each side .and it 's also important to note that the hole should not be too big .you want , the paper has a tendency to widen after the fastener is put in .so you do n't want to make it too wide .you just want to make a small hole to give enough of an opening that you can insert the fastener .then once it 's in it will fit nice and snug and you can go ahead and open and close the other end as the ends of the fastener separate .and , therefore , you 'll be able to separate the two pieces of cardboard and insert the picture .so i 've now shown you how to make your four points along the picture frame and make holes so that you 'll be able to insert the metal fasteners .
so , now to add some color .i love this aquamarine blue color , so i 'll be using that to color the inside of my flowers .so , pretty much what i do is , i go towards the bottom of the leaf.
so , once you have a hoophouse , and you realize the profound value of every inch , invariably , you start to go up , so look around and you can see the vertical space , here .the space is valuable , right to the ceiling , and so we want to build it in such a way , that we can utilize both the ground space , and the vertical space .this center structure was put in as a bracing , to keep snow loads , from collapsing the hoophouse , but it has the secondary benefit of making a wonderful boardwalk , so we have all kinds of space for plants here , and then underneath , the shade , cooler loving plants , like the beets , and the onions and the leeks .they can still hang out , and get a little bit of respite from the heat , and then that 's not all , because we have crops , which will go up , up , up , and be trellised right to the center perlin .you can see the remnants of last year 's string beans , which were fourteen feet high , and itching to go higher , so the entire hoophouse is a project in managing space , and i 'm always taking trays and putting them in new places .let 's say it 's too hot , for these little lettuces .i could tuck them over to here , and that would give them a little more shade .let 's say i had something like these delfiniums , that were heat loving .i can tuck them right in here , against this black barrel , where they just get all the heat , and then if i have something like peppers , or eggplants , or tomatoes , that really love heat , i 'll put them up to the upper shelves , where it 's up into the nineties .just so long as i can get up there , review them , and remember to hydrate them in time .
hi , this is doc lowry and we 're talking about primitive tattoo machines compared to a modern machine .most of the primitive machines are home-made equipment , or are referred to as jail-house rigs .they usually consist of , kind of the same elements .they take , they build off the tube.
i actually had to run it for a little bit because there 's no wind .so , to keep it off the ground , you know , keep from getting too scuffed up , i kind of had to book it , but now what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to give it a couple of extra little shakes to make sure i can try and get the sand out , specially from this area in between the leading edge and the canopy right here .if it gets stuck up in there.
you need to have some tension between the mouthpiece and your vibrating lips ; however a temptation among younger players is press as hard as possible to try to get those high notes when they are not coming out .so what happens is that they end up pulling the horn very hard to their face like so .if you are playing too hard , your are going to notice maybe two things .first of all you would very quickly develop a ring around your mouth that is a indentation from the mouthpiece .now if you have been playing for a extended period of time , that ring is going to show up no matter what .but if you have been playing for very short period and you are pressing very hard and you notice that you have very red ring.
there are two last things that you want to do to give your window a thorough cleaning and one of them .again i 'll just rinse this out in the pine sol water .the water is still getting a little dirty now.
in this clip of warrior training , this is a continuation of the other clip , we 're going to go over walking squats which correspond with walking lunges because they both work on the base muscles of the legs , the quadriceps , the gluteus maximus , the hamstrings .the walking squats in warrior training.
you can not love others unless you love yourself .and how do you love yourself .be you man or woman , let 's start from the foundation .oftentimes when we were children , we were put down for a variety of reasons , either through a religious conviction ; we 're guilty about this , we 're guilty about that .it has nothing to do with self .so remove self from that .when you get to the point in your life where you 're an adult , and you look at yourself.
we 're talking about skateboarding parts and maintenance .we 're going to talk about one part of the skateboard , the wheels .a skateboard has 4 wheels 2 in the front and 2 in the front they spin across a fixed axle which is part of a trunk .unlike a car or a bicycle where the wheel moves with the axle on a skateboard , the axle is fixed and the wheel moves around the axle on metal barrings .choosing the right wheel is a very important part of getting started in your skateboard equipment collection .wheels come in different sizes they also come in different widths .you 'll notice this wheel is much wider than this wheel , a wider wheel is more appropriate for ramp and street skating .whereas a thinner wheel is more appropriate for street skating .wheels also come in different hardness .some wheels are very softer thing as other wheels are very hard .a harder wheel is going to make it harder to travel on rough surfaces .a softer wheel is going to make it easier to travel on rough surfaces.
after you have your club single throw down pretty clean , where you can take your club in each hand and throw it to the other without really worrying about it , when it just goes where it 's supposed to go .you need to pick up a second club , start working with two .when you start juggling with clubs you ca n't forget everything you 've learned when you start juggling with balls .all the throws have to be the same height , they have to go in the same rhythm.
have you ever wondered about the history of chair massage ?well i 'm going to tell you today .i 'm sundae with natural sundae .now chair massage has been around since the beginning of time basically when massage therapy began , because it 's basically just a form , a portable form of massage , it 's just using a chair .and the first massage chair was actually invented in 1986 and it weighed thirty-six pounds and it came , it was made out of a big , heavy wooden box and it quickly expanded into a chair .however , this proved to be really heavy for the poor therapist who had to lug it around everywhere , and not as comfortable for the clients that were sitting in it .now it took about ten years , but ten years later there was a new version made .it was invented out of metal which made it much lighter for the therapist to carry and much more comfortable for the client to sit in .and of course , with the addition of extra padding and the strategically placed parts on the chair , it made it very , very comfortable to work with and to sit in .so that 's just a very brief history on the , the history of the massage chair , and i hope you 've learned a little bit about it today .i 'm sundae with natural sundae .thanks .
hi i 'm megan milano.
let 's play our e major scale again .scale degree.
ask dr.
and we kind of see it , but let us add more .let us get it like a big maze of confusing things in here .pick a random point .how about right here ?all right , and then we will just start like we did -- like this one , like we just started with this line right here ,right ?just like with a normal box.
with those same people whether the files would be auto or video or even programs .this is what morpheus looks like there is a lot of different things you can do with morpheus aside from just sharing files you can actually create and download and manage pod cast .you can morpheus has built in web browser.
to become a neurosurgeon , first you must become a doctor .to do that , you start by completing a bachelor 's degree at a four year college or university .being that medical school is highly competitive , you 'll really want to focus on keeping your undergraduate gpa above 3.75 , and you 'll want to either major in a science , or complete all of the science prerequisites necessary for medical school .once you have completed your bachelor 's education , you need to take what 's known as the medical college admissions test .all applicants to medical school must take this test , and it covers the physical sciences , biological sciences , verbal reasoning , and written communication .medical schools use your emcat scores , your gpa , course of study , and college you attended , along with other applicant information in assessing candidates to medical school .if they believe you 're a viable candidate , you 'll they will be , they will grant you an interview , which is really a critical step along the process .once you 're admitted to medical school , you begin an additional four year course of study .the first two years of medical school focus primarily on didactic instruction and health sciences , and the second two years focus on teaching clinical knowledge and skills .along the way , you 'll have to pass both parts of the united states license exam , or the usmle , step one , covering your basic knowledge of health science , disease process , and treatment modalities , and step 2 covering your competency in clinical skills .once you 've completed medical school you 'll be granted the degree of md , but before you can practice as a neurosurgeon , you will have to apply for a neurosurgery residency .now , neurosurgery is one of the disciplines that has their own residency program , as opposed to the national match .you will apply to a residency program in neurosurgery much as you did to medical school , and once you are accepted , you will begin a an additional six to eight years of graduate medical education , which , during which you will first learn how to become a surgeon , and then , how to become specifically a neurosurgeon .given that neurosurgery or surgery on the brain is a very complex and technical process , it is a very arduous residency program .but upon completing your residency in neurosurgery , you can sit for the state board exam in the state in which you wish to practice , and you will be ready to practice medicine as a neurosurgeon .
now i 'll teach you some more sport signs .hockey .hockey .rink .skating .or skating rink .ice skating .goal .goal .helmet .helmet .puck .puck .the next sport is soccer .soccer .goal or goalie .scrimmage .scrimmage .kick .kick .wrestling .wrestling .wrestling match .tennis .tennis .tennis court .tennis match .good job !practice those signs .
hey guys , so now that you 've learned some jazz , funk routines , some different steps , i 'm going to put it together for you in a combination and say farewell .
the next exercise i 'm going to demonstrate is the biceps curl .this is a great exercise both standing or seated .but , again try to resist the temptation of a fixed plain movement pattern like a preacher curl type position getting your arms over the top of something to try to isolate .no muscle in the body works in an isolation type position .so , again always the opportunity to do things in a full bodied type functional pattern .so , some of the things that people do that always go wrong .again , just always in this little box we like to live in .rotating forward , collapsing the body .bringing lots of tension into the neck .instead , just like the triceps pull down push down roll your shoulders back .hinge your hips back slightly .pull the abdominal wall in .think about as you curl the weight up , squeezing the muscles you 're trying to use .biceps , definitely using the triceps as well .definitely keeping the shoulder blades back .and , then do n't forget to lengthen the arms all the way back out .final and most importantly ,breathe .exhale , inhale to come all the way back to the starting position .same exercise from the side , biceps curl .slightly hinging back .it does n't mean i need to squat .i 'm just in an athletic ready position .ready to go .ready to biceps curl .exhale to come up .inhale back .be very aware of your shoulders wanting to roll forward .so , just keep them rolling back .draw the stomach in .exhale , inhale to stretch .
what we want to talk about now is the player ?s.
we 're here to talk about tooth whitening .tooth whitening previously was coined as bleaching .what we do in tooth whitening , one of the main things is we want to be allowed to have the enamel of our teeth to be lightened .the enamel is consist of the outer structure of the tooth .and on the inner part of the tooth is the top portion is called the dentin and the bottom portion , the root is called a samenton.
now , we 're going to take a look at the b major chord .now , just to reiterate , the major chord is made up of the first , third and fifth notes of a major scale .in the scale b , you have b as the root , then you have a c sharp as the second , a d sharp as the third , an e as the fourth , and a f sharp as the fifth .so , we need a b , d sharp and a f sharp to make this chord .now , let 's look at the ukulele here , let 's start with the g string .it 's not going to do us much good.
so the day before your move you 're going to want to make final arrangements for things or just check in on arrangements that you 've made , for instance , the arrangements that you 've made for your pets .so i 'll be taking my cat over to my parent  s house tonight so that she can stay there.
now , we 're going to go over our solfege , comparing it to the g major scale .okay .so , solfege , if you do n't know already , is ,i 'm.
our table saw comes with two very nifty features .one of those features is adjustable depth of cut .at the bottom of the table you will notice two wheels .the depth of cut wheel will lower and raise your blade above the surface of the table .on the left hand side of the machine there is this other wheel , and this wheel will allow you to tip the blade .thus create something that is called the bevel cut .a little scale located at the bottom will allow you to see exactly how many degrees you are tilting the blade of the table .and this will conclude the nifty features of the delta cutting saw .
hi , this is yolanda from vanveenbulbs.com , and in this segment we 're going to talk about how to dig a flower bed .now , we all have grassy areas in our yard , and we would like to have more flower beds , but we do n't know how to start , and what to do .but basically to dig a flower bed is just like it sounds .it 's just to dig out the grass , put some compost in its place , and then you have a new flower bed that 's ready to go .i 'll show ya !so when you 're digging out grass you 've got ta use a lot of pressure , so i just kind of work its , work its way down .and a lot of times it 's just been raining for the last two weeks , so.
what i 'm going to show you how to do now is to add more crinkle to a crinkle crochet .what we have here is a.
a hitch is a classic way to secure something to a solid object , post , hitching post .it 's really a classic way to things .so , if you look down here , you can see i have my makeshift hitch post.
now i 'm going to help johnny demonstrate the sideward leg push while i 'm pushing his leg .so he lean against the wall ,his hand 's above his head , okay .his other hand are in .his leg straight .i 'm going to push his leg as high as i could .okay , go higher johnny ?yeah .okay .exhale .relax .now touch your toes , okay .good .count to five .one , two , three , four , five .now let 's switch legs .okay , same thing .one , two , three , four , and five .ladies and gentlemen , this concludes the sideward leg push.
now let 's play our scale once again .( playing violin )e natural , f sharp , g natural , a natural , b natural , c sharp , d sharp now let 's go over our eighth scale degree which is the same note as our first scale degree.
so i already lined this up as top here , this being bottom .so if i work with some young people and they had a choice of wood , decided and then they will probably ask me , what do i think ?how are we going to work this ?so usually i go for my own past experienced.
hi my name is lauren and today i 'm here to discuss haircuts for thick curly hair .the curlier your hair is , the longer in length you maybe want to keep on your hair .the longer your length is , the more weight it has in order to weigh your curl down .if you have a very kinky curl , you pretty much have two options when it comes to haircuts .you can either keep it very long and add some layers in order to remove bulk or you can make it very short .anything bob length , unless your straightening your hair everyday can tend to look triangular .a good way for stylist and even for yourself to actually go through and texturize your hair would be to actually pick your hair up with its curl , turn your hair and then use one of your scissors.
so , this is how i would do it .we 're going to , we 're going to make kind of like matchsticks of the pepper .we 're going to cut off the top and the bottom .and you want to clean the inside .let 's take this .this is a nice-looking knife for this purpose .slice it down , and i 'm going to open up the pepper .and in order to clean the ribs out of it.
on a 3 count , 1 , 2 , and 3.in real time .2 punches .1 , 2 , low kick .there you go .
okay , there 's a phenomenon known in pool that is termed , `` squirt '' .squirt is a pool players jargon meaning deflection .in this case , it 's deflection on the cue ball .we 're deflecting the cue ball off of its natural line of aim .and , the way that squirt happens is when you go trying to use any english , whether it be left or right , using english with a forceful stroke .in other words , if i had this setup here again .and , i 'm trying to shoot the ball straight down to that piece of chalk ,but i 'm going to use english.
grab the finger or toe in the bent position , and align the bones as they normally align by sliding them over and putting them back in place .this is going to cause a great deal of discomfort and pain .afterwards , knowing there is damage that has been done to the joint by stretching ligaments and tendons , it would be advisable to take that finger or toe and splint it , or tape it to the digit next to it until the healing process has been complete .i 'm captain joe bruni .stay safe , and we 'll see ya ' next time .
so , i decided to include his camera in the image .and , if you look closely , you can see in the reflection of his glasses , the image that he was actually trying to capture on film .now , this portrait is an example of how you can show somebody and kind of depict what type of person they are or what kinds of things.
and i 'm.
or , you could also get some other type of injury .you also want to make sure that work area is well lit .it is very hard to work in the dark .you also want to make sure that you are not working in any type of an explosive atmosphere .if you are using the belt sander , and you hit a nail , it could cause sparks to fly off which could ignite anything explosive .and , lastly , you want to make sure and keep anyone that 's watching at a safe distance so that you can properly use your tool without the possibility of them getting injured .
what if this hand , here , were your hand ?it 's a hand where you need to be able to avoid taking the queen of spades .okay ?the hand , the reason i say that , is because this hand contains these spades and no other spades .and it would be even worse to just have these two spades , but it contains the three highest spades that are not the queen .and , there are only three spades.
but they forget about some of them when they are going on the road .so i mean when you are at the airport on the plane , wasting time , even at the hotel in between the gigs that is when you use your personal entertainment devices like let 's say you have a smart media phone or a mp3 player or the new smart media players which play video and audio .those things are a great tools to have i even recorded my own concerts with my video camera .even the phones these days are like my phone here is a smart media phone it has a video ,mp3 , it has to video cards in it , it has memory so it does n't matter where i am if i want to kill time or get some entertainment.
this is a little more complex because you 've got to make sure your anchor points are perfectly level with each other otherwise your mirror will be slanted and there 's not a whole lot of room for error on this one .so the first thing we want to do is we want to measure the distance between the two anchor points .so , i 'm going to get my tape measure.
and we are making etched glass .we 're doing a picture frame .and i have my pattern right here already placed on the picture frame , and now i 'm going to tack it down with some tape .and i 'm just taking some regular masking tape , and kind of ripping it into smaller strips .and this is just to tack it down a little , just so it 'll stay in place .this way it stays right where i want it as we 're rubbing it off , rubbing the stencil off onto our glass .and this is just regular masking tape .masking tape works well because it does n't leave a residue , it comes up easy .these two we 'll just kind of tape together .there we go .and now we 're ready to rub our stencil onto the glass .
( airbrushing )now this orange blend is not going to exact going to the original orange and it does not need to be because this is wood grain .what you see here is just anything of what the product looks like.
now , if you are that type of person who gets the migraine , in spring or in winter and especially in the morning or evening , and if gets worse if you bend your head down , then aruwait suggest that you very simply take a bowl of boiling water add five drops of eucalyptus oil and simply inhale .if you do n't have any eucalyptus oil add some freshly cut ginger to the boiling water .inhale and watch the migraine disappear .the other thing you could do is , to buy some dried ginger powder from any indian store .take about less the one fourth teaspoon , add a little bit of water to make a smooth paste and apply it over your forehead , leave for half hour and then very gently , carefully so as to not sting the eyes wash your forehead .and see the difference , your migraine would have become lessened or would have gone .
now we 're going to look at the growing and the care of your geranium in your garden .your geranium needs sun , and lots of it .when you move inland , your geranium can perform quite well in filtered light , let 's say underneath a tree .it would need about four to five , to even six hours of scattered light to have it bloom .this plant comes from a mediterranean climate , which means that if you live in an area of the world that freezes during the winter time , you must protect this sweet little plant from a frost .you can either mulch it , you can cone it , you can move it indoors to a greenhouse or your home .you can move it close to your home , underneath the tree , but do protect it from the frost .when you water your geranium try to keep all of the water off of the leaves , and when you water , remember to water early in the morning or in the late afternoon .now the early europeans found many different reasons for this wonderful growing , colorful perennial in your garden .now , you can use this for scents , perfumes , oils , food preparation , and some even said that this sweet perennial deters mosquitoes .what a wonderful , colorful addition to anyone 's garden .
the next thing we are going to look at is what we call the hand , finger and grip strengtheners .i have a set here .these basically are used for strengthening not only the fingers but your hands , your wrist , even your forearms , your shoulders , everything .and you 'll get a good little workout with everything on it .but you can use these for strengthening your hands for work on a speed bag later for work on a heavy bag .it will help in your jump roping .it 's going to be a good all-around exercise .very simple to use of course .but the thing is you should try to do it in like maybe the two minute increments.
in this clip we 're going to do a review of the couple of the steps that we just went over .so , the first step , remember , the drummer tells you when to go , when to stop and when to give a solo .king , king , king , king .and again , and we 're going to move to the next step , king , king , king , king .and stop .
okay , now i 'm going to show the leaders roll and the side by side charleston stomp on five .i 'll demonstrate it first , one , two , three , four , five .one , two , three , four , five , one , two , three , four , five.
s called adverse the on , the plane wants to , the nose of the plane wants to turn opposite the direct we are turning .we need to add that right rudder .and a little back pressure to compensate for the loss of lift .and continue turning around about thirty degrees .okay ?alright .
you could choose either method .you can even paint different colors , pre-paint different colors , and then you can put them all together.
next we 're going to be going over how you do around the leg , alright .so round leg 's going to go to look like this.
i 'll show you .you walk in , confident , you might say , `` hi , '' to the audition people .you definitely go up to the accompanist first , speak to the accompanist , tell the accompanist what you need and come over and show them that you 're ready .they may ask you what you 're singing.
so again , from the technique , once i 've done my technique , i take the person down , i pull them away from their center , controlling them down .once he 's on his back like this , i have to move him over .he 's got too many weapons right now to attack me with .he can kick me , he can punch me , he can bite my ankle , and i do n't want that .so what i do is , holding his wrist.
here 's a style of defending yourself against multiple opponents if you 're surprised from the side or from behind .you want to use your shoulders to defend yourself .and these are more rushing style or wavy arm punches , but you can generate a lot of power and also defend yourself with your arms if you 're attacked by many opponents or in a crowd .so if my attacker comes from the side here , i 'm going to defend with my shoulder .lift my shoulder , tuck my chin .so i might take it in the face a little bit , but i 'm not getting knocked out with the sucker punch .and then i go right into my strike .so if he throws here , he 's trapped , i go to my back fist , my arm punch here and come back to the bag or other opponents .you can go quickly from one opponent to the next .and my arms are defending myself as i go .if i show between the bags just to demonstrate .if he 's behind me , i take out the first guy.
once this is enclosed the air is trapped between.
flip it over and slide a bobby pin right there .then just flip the hair over and you do n't see the bobby pin it.
now hopefully when learning three balls , you learned a pattern that i call a `` pattern stack '' , high , middle , low , but is also notated as 5 , 3 , 1.if you can not do this trick , you do n't want to try the four-ball version .the four ball version is the same thing , but now you 're going to add an extra high throw .in site swaps this would be.
the next step we have here is to find a bucket .this is a professional window washing bucket .it works great because you can have a long sponge and stick it in there without having a whole lot of water in the bucket .that is why they are elongated like that .second if you are just doing this around the house and you want something to use , i just got this from home depot , any old bucket will do .the problem you find with some of these buckets if you are trying to get your sponge wet , sometimes you have to stick it in one side and dip it in the other.
and it looks like this .he is going to attack with a shomen strike , and i 'm going to move out of the way by passing his strike , grabbing the wrist in a shiho nage hold , coming underneath , and bringing him down to the floor .again uke strikes , i grab his strike and bring him down , and i finish by pinning his arm .in real time it goes like this .
so , the drones that are up over my shoulder here are tuned to the chanter .the two tenor drones are tuned one octave below the low a on the chanter , and the bass drone here is tuned two octaves below the low a on the chanter .there is n't much of an adjustment on these tubes , lengthening the tube flattens the pitch , makes the tube longer , therefore a lower pitch .shortening the tubes slightly increases the pitch , makes it a slightly a higher pitch .but ultimately , it 's a very small range of movement that changes the pitch of these pipes in order to tune them to the bottom note on the chanter .with the bass drone , you generally always leave the top of it set so that there 's just a little bit of the hemp line showing and.
inner thigh is another very easy relaxing posture .bring your feet up and put your feet together and let your heels come in .you try to hold on to those toes.
to move around the drum kit all you really have to do is just turn your body .your hands can pretty much stay in one spot .and you just kind of move your hips to get around the toms .and to get to the symbols .a good way to practice your technique getting around the drum set is just to hit everything.
in the chilling process we 're trying to drop the temperature of the wort as fast as we can to encourage something called cold break which will precipitate proteins and also get the wort to a temperature in which we can mix in our yeast as quickly as we can.
repeat , this time faster .then it 's , nay , nay , ne , ni , no , nu .then say , la , lay , lee , lie , lo , lu .you want to say these , each grouping , several times , starting with , ma , may , me , my , mo , mu , then go to , na , nay , ne , ni ,no , nu , then say la , lay , lee , lie , lo , lu .i recommend that , instead of repeating the one phrase , like the 'm ' phrase , may , me , my , moe , mu , but instead of doing it three or four times , which you always can , then you can jump to , na , nay ,ne.
okay we are here at tub number 2.
so now you got that hole that your needle tool just made in the bottom of your piece.
well , the biggest thing i can recommend , is go out and get yourself a teacher .decide what instrument you want to do , and take lessons , but if you 're really low on your budget , you can definitely go on youtube , and go on the internet , and there are a lot of websites that will teach you how to become a musician .if you 're really self motivated , you can do it yourself , but if you 're like most people , you need a teacher who can really break it down for you , and help you through the process .another great thing you can do , is go to open mike , start performing there , and start meeting other musicians .if you can get friends who are musicians , and you can get together and start practicing together , it 's amazing what you can learn , just from other people .listen to a lot of music , and decide what kind of music you like , really start listening with a different ear .if you 're a drummer , every time you listen to music , listen to what the drummer is doing , exactly .where is the downbeat ?where are the snares ?where is the cymbal ?start fine tuning your ear , and practice , practice , practice .this has been athena reich , in new york city .
if you live in new orleans , look near the levees ; if not , in your house , go to your skate park , just something , just find a ramp .that way , you can practice your tricks on .so once you 've found your ramp , you want to go ahead and warm up .cruise up and down it , roll up , come back down fakie , roll switch , come back down regular , maybe pop a couple of ollies .so once you 're real comfortable with that , you can go ahead .right off switch , you 'll be coming up , just pop a good solid ollie , slide your foot to level it out , slam back down on the bolts , and the key is just to stay centered .so just remember to stay over your board centered and you 'll come back down and roll away clean .and that 's how you switch ollie on a bank ramp .
i 'll be talking about yu gi.
o.k .so we have this placket all hand tacked up , the middle under the arm seam tacked up .i 'm ready to start working on the lining .i want you to make sure first that you get that little extra thread that you have hanging loose.
okay , now we 'll complete our first fringe piece .and you want to bring the beads up close to the edge of the pillow.
in this clip i 'm going to talk to you about how to maintain the results of your body wrap at home .one of my favorite things in the entire world is this cactus bristle body brush .and we use it very gently , upward motions , always toward the heart .because we want to follow the lymphatic system .and at home , you just want to go very gently .as you can see , i 'm not bending the bristles , i 'm not applying a lot of pressure .this is the best thing to prevent cellulite , also to get your body moving , to energize yourself in the morning .definitely use it before your shower .wonderful .excellent if followed by aromatherapy oil at home .in the treatment , we apply aromatherapy oils to the products that we use to wrap you .and there 's no reason why you ca n't give yourself and aromatherapy treatment at home .whether it 's inhaling or the actual application to your skin , you 're going to get the benefits .and also , from the smoothness standpoint , you really want a great body hydrator , one that contains shea butter or coco butter , but also , something with olive products is excellent for anti-aging and soothing sensitive skin .so , you want to make sure it 's a nice , rich cream .i love that one .
let 's drill our three quarter down shimmy .let 's first start by bringing it down in the front on one leg , then press it out shifting it outside and still on that same leg .up on the other side , down , out , up .down , out , up .a little faster , down , out , up , down , out , up , down , out , up , down , out , up .good .try and get all the action in the hips here and keep the head as still as you can .good .now we 're going to speed it up just a little more .good .let 's slow it down again .it 's always a good idea to go slow , medium and fast so that you can build up your endurance and precision .it 's not about going fast , it 's about doing it accurately .when you do it accurately you can always speed it up.
hi i 'm sundae from natural sundae and if you are wondering what tui na massage is i can tell you .now tui na massage is actually a chinese form of touch therapy that has been around for over 2 ,000 years and.
i lay the entire kite out , put my bridles inside and , then from the wingtips , we fold in towards the center from both sides .make sure all my struts are on clips.
i 've also painted the bottom .you want to orient your box .this is where the front latch goes and this is where the back hinges go .you want to make sure that you put your pictures on in the right direction .let 's start with the top picture .we 're going to cut it out.
once i have rinsed completely , the shampoo out of her hair , my next step will be to condition it .again , i will be using curl enhancing products , and this one , is a curls conditioner .this shampoo and conditioner , are specifically designed for curly hair again , and it will help you form a uniform curl , all over her head .you can decide on how much conditioner you 'll need , according to how much your hair needs it .i 'm going to start crunching through the hair , so that the curl begins to form on its own .make sure that you distribute the conditioner through , all over her hair .it 's important that you do that , because the curl needs to be uniform .i 'm going to rinse now , take my towel , and towel it off .what i 'm doing with her curl , is i 'm.
another common movement , which is used in one of the drum rhythms called bottom bai , is another right to left movement , and it involves picking up one of your legs and putting it behind you as you move right to left .so what you want to do is , we 'll start with the feet , and you just want to step right.
the first thing we 're going cover about beat boxing is how you hold the microphone .it 's very important the way you hold the microphone because if you are holding it wrong you 're not going to be able to get the right sound out of the microphone .so first off , make sure you 're holding the base of the microphone , and have your right hand over the top of the microphone .this right hand 's really important because if you do n't have it over you 're going to be losing a lot of the sound that you 're generating out of your mouth .so if you beat box without the hand it 'll sound like this .but if you have your hand over it it 'll sound like this .so that 's basically the raw basics that you need in holding the microphone .make sure you 're hand 's over there.
mostly the blue is on that side and this is like a dark , not a navy ,well i guess you could say navy blue .i am going to use this blue here.
i 've done a little bit of dash.
now , unlike a saxophone , the bass clarinet in the middle between your legs .the reason being , that you do not want to interfere with function of these lower keys here by touching it with your thigh , for instance .sitting or standing , you want to have it between your legs .you want the mouth to piece to meet you at your lower lip , not at your chin or up above.
in this clip we 'll talk briefly about why it 's good to avoid drugs , caffeine and alcohol .one of the things you got to remember is that when you have a phobia , your body 's already moving faster , your minds thinking faster , or slower , ( depending on the situation ) than you want it to .by taking , drinking things like tea or coffee or sodas , you 're actually going to be adding caffeine to your body .caffeine is going to speed up things , and can actually lead to increased anxiety .so you really do n't want to add to all the anxiety you 're feeling by fueling the fire .same thing goes with drugs and alcohol .if you 're experiencing any kind of depression , it can actually add to it .the drugs and the alcohol also may seem like a really good idea , like if i take a beer , drink a beer right now , or take this pill , it 's going to relax me , and in the long run it actually could end up provoking more anxiety , and making things a lot worse .sometimes a doctor will prescribe anxiety medication or antidepressants , and you need to follow that prescription however it is .if you feel that after you 're taking whatever medication , and it 's not working , talk to your doctor , but you never want to self medicate .
so , in order to make your lid fit your bowl.
i 'm here to answer the question.
so , we 've went through some maintenance , some basic maintenance for your paintball gun , and we 've shown you how to check that weapon after the fact and make sure that it 's functioning properly .but , let 's say you 're at home.
it 's very soft and it 's a combination of synthetic and natural hair .this is a great brush for powder because it keeps everything loose without giving it a cakey feel .like i said ,i 'm using a loose powder today , so i want to start by taking some of the powder and pouring it into the cap .that 's good .i 'm going to lightly tap the brush into the powder .tap off some of the excess and just lightly go over the entire face .under the eye where we just concealed , working my way down and out .again , tap , work up toward the hair line .you always want to work your way toward the hair line .this is a translucent powder.
let 's talk about the purpose of the chorus in a country song .now , where country is different from folk music , they are two very similar genres .what 's different from folk music and country music is that in folk music , the main point of the chorus and of the writing in general is for the sake of protest and stating a moral or something like that whereas with country music , there is elements of that and that 's a way you can go .however , with country music , that 's not nearly as important .the point of country music , especially the chorus for the country music is to tie the story together in a clever way , in singable way , that 's just very -- that 's simple and easy to remember .the hook in country music is one of the most prominent and singable hooks you 'll ever sing in any genre of music and it is something that you need to take time and really work hard on , try to come up with a clever and witty line that might be some -- a cliche.
so now to balance off what we just did previously.
good.
i 'm bill elzey with showplace lawns .let 's talk a little bit about how to get rid of grub worms .the big ugly .what they call white grubs .that are in like a c shape in your lawn .they are actually the larva stage of the june bugs that we have later on in the year .grub worms eat the roots off the grass .therefore of course killing the grass .you should be able to take the grass and just roll it up if you have grub damage , because they cut the roots completely off .the best way to prevent this from happening is number one .be sure that you have a very fertile soil .work to have fertile ground and fertile plants .that will discourage them very much right there .the second thing is use beneficial nematodes .one of the things that nematodes does well is to take care of the grubs .to eliminate them from causing your lawn a problem .nematodes are sprayed out .they are good for lots of insects .this should be done about three times a year or depending on where you are , how long your growing season is might determine maybe just twice or so forth .but beneficial nematodes are an ideal way of getting out in front and keeping those grub worms away and works together really well with a fertile soil .with the nematodes out be sure , and this would be in keeping with a fertile soil .to do a regular watering .to help keep the nematodes alive and active .again , beneficial nematodes and fertile soil .two great , healthy , non-abrasive ways of controlling grub worms .
so we 're talking about hands that are good to stand pat on in the game of poker dice .and let 's talk about that .i would say that the bare minimum , if you want to keep it to one roll , is a pair of aces .you roll a pair of aces and you 're rolling first , you can stand pat and say , `` ha !beat that ! ''that puts the minimal amount of pressure , the minimal amount of pressure on your opponent to give you the possibility of winning .now , better , would be two pair .say aces up , aces and tens .or kings and tens , kings up .kings and jacks , of course , that 's also kings up , and so forth .any two pair ofter one or two rolls.
life link is when any card , especially any particular creature cards , enchantments , and sorceries are linked directly to your life .now here we have venerable monk .he comes into play .he 's a 2/2 and when venerable monk comes into play you gain 2 life .that is an example of life link .another example of life link , is here we have , highway robber .who is also a 2/2 , but when he comes into play , not only do you gain 2 life , you can have a target opponent lose 2 life .more examples of this are cards that say , when starting creature , an example : venerable monk ,deals damage to a player.
as you are reading a piece of music you want to be aware of dynamic markings which simply means how loud or soft the music should be .frequently dynamic markings will look like thishere we see a mezzo forte and here is an example of a mezzo piano.
so the last part of any ensemble when you are putting it together and you are wanting to go retro.
alright , i am going to tell you now how to prepare a reed to play .it is important to get the reed wet , to get a good vibration when you are blowing into the saxophone .thinking again about a reed in a pond .the pores in this thing carry water from the bottom to the top of the reed .if you look at it from the back you can almost see the pores .the best way for me to start preparing my reed is to put the back end in my mouth .it is going to pull the spit from my mouth through the reed actually for me , it is just like magic , the whole thing could be wet pretty soon.
costa waez :now , i 'm going to talk to you about safety .when you use the hookah , you need to use all the safety , necessary things .now , you see the hookah on the table ?this is wrong .we just put it because we 're shooting this video .what you do , you put it down on the floor , at the bottom of the floor , you have to hold it from the bottom , not from the top because the bottom might slip down and it break .so you move it down on the floor and you place it carefully .the reason that we do n't have it on the table.
d minor is extracted from the f major scale , so everything is natural , but b.
so , next , we 're going to be aging the clothing .and for this , i 'm going to want to have a couple different shades of gray .get gray by first taking white and then adding in some mars black and using our palette knife here , mix it up .actually in this case , i do n't even want to make it fuller monochrome , you can have different shades of gray because , as you 're going to see here , we 're going to use a bunch of different types of grays .warmer and cooler varieties of gray .this under painting of blue here is very vibrant and strong .it looks like , you know , just bought this outfit down at the store .so , we 're going to age it .because we 're going to go with kind of more of a zombieish , ghoulish look for our female subject here .so again , to illustrate the examples of what you can do just by building up the layers .you can see automatically , it 's already starting to look more dingy .i 'm not even always like taking my brush and dragging it over the colors .more of kind of like a spotty .and when you do that , you get like these wonderful areas of like a regularly shaped emphasis to where the paint 's a little thicker than it is elsewhere .now , i 'm extending this brush work down this way .again , just kind of dragging , taking some of the muted tone out .it 's really ; you can also see that where i 'm allowing the blue to still show through.
the tuning pegs , each of them correspond to each of strings on the violin , and as you 'll see , if you look closely , this lower left hand peg ,this tunes the g string .the upper left hand peg , tunes the d string .the upper right hand peg , tunes the a string , and the lower right hand peg ,tunes the e string .in the very beginning , you will most likely have four fine tuners at the bottom of your violin , .as you 'll see on my violin , i only have one fine tuner on the e string .and , that 's because after you really become comfortable with tuning , then usually what you can do is you can take off all of the pegs , although it 's a good idea to keep your e string peg because it is a thin string .it 's not good to tune as much from here because you run the risk of actually breaking the string .by keeping this fine tuner here , it 'll help you tune the e string a lot easier because it 's a thin string.
okay , one of the things an athlete has to remember is that he or she has to be prepared .the day before your race or the night before your competition , make sure you drink a lot of fluids .make sure you have a lot of fluids into your body .make sure that you 're resting .make sure that you 're properly stretching the body out before and after your competition or your event .this helps a lot in terms keeping the body efficient , keeping the body healthy .the more rest you can get is important , the more fluids you put into your body .it helps you to maintain longer on the track .it helps you in your workouts .it helps you in your daily life .

this opening style is called a cowl halter .what that means is that it 's like a cowl neck shirt , except it has a halter top .a halter top means that no matter what you have , here is your design style .in order for it to be labeled with this word , halter , it needs to cut in ever so lightly , slightly , or a whole wide , it does n't matter , needs to cut in from the armpit up to some point on the shoulder line , and then it has to go around the neck .that 's the whole point of a halter.
a nice way to lengthen through the spine is a nice flat back flow.
alright , we 've waited about five minutes now , to let our rice cook , and if you would like to speed that process up , you can put it in the refrigerator and let that cool .so , what we 're going to do now is we 're going to scoop out a half a cup of our rice , and we 're going to put that in our bowl .then , we 're going to go , and measure out a half cup of cottage cheese , and we 'll add that as well .then , we 're going to go and take two eggs , and then we 're going to gently stir and swirl , until the egg and cottage cheese , is completely incorporated in the rice .
lem.
there are many tools that a producer has at his disposal .some are a keyboard , a sequencer , a sampler .now let me just break that down a little bit , for you .the main tools are a sequencer .every production , every you know , song has some sort of rhythm to it .now unless , you have a live drummer playing the track , you need to program that , into some sort of beat machine .so that 's the sequencer .that 's the kick , the snare , the hi hat .then you have the key board .which basically , you play the melodies , you can mix strings , all these different things .you can use samples .a lot of producers do use samples .and in that you 're going to use a sampler .and you 'd fit it , match it with the sequencer .put the sample over it and then loop it .that 's one way to do it .now another way is to bring in musicians .get a beat going , get the drum .the drum track .and then , have live musicians play over it .that 's going to give you the best sound .some other tools , that you would definitely need as a music producer , is a computer .personally , i recommend a macintosh , an apple computer .i use pro tools which is a great software .you can also use resin which is actually , where you would make the beat .some people make the beat in pro tools .but it 's a little bit different method .i wo n't go into that , right now .but basically , you know , you have your software .you have your hardware .and together , you make it all work .some other tools that you would need as a music producer .aside from actually making the music , is a microphone , a preamp which amplifies the sound .a compressor and some other out board gear .that you know , you could find at a guitar center or any where else , that you 're looking to buy equipment .now this equipment is very important .because it boosts the sound .it makes it sound a little bit more professional .

some people who play strait whist like to indicate that you have to bid a certain minimum bid , say two or three .i 've seen variations where whoever the dealing side is , and this is one of the few times you 'll ever see the dealer at disadvantage , it is a rule requirement that somebody takes the hand for three , so if the opponents are really clever , it 's much easier to set or defeat a bid of three than it is to make a bid of three .why is that ?because you only need five tricks in your combined hands to defeat a contract of three .however , if you declare it for three , remember you have to make nine tricks .that 's not always easy , ok ?so please keep that in mind that if lose five tricks in a bid of three , so it 's much easier to set a bid of three .so what stick the dealer means is if you have a minimum bid of three.
what they do is that everybody that 's involved makes cards that are this size , 2 1/2 inches x.
our trench is dug , three inches deep .the soil 's level , so now it 's time for us to dig the hole .first i 'm going to use this little shovel to mark out the area that i want to dig .now , i 'm going to start digging .now , we want the hole to be about twice as wide as the container .so , about up to here , and about up to here , and like this , and like this .that 'll create a nice rectangular hole .now , i 'll use the trowel to make the hole into a rectangle .using the smaller shovel helps us to really get the hole the dimensions that we want .okay .this looks about right .now , i 'm going to remove the plant from the container .now we can see the root ball .we want our whole to be this deep .alright , looks good .that 's how we 're digging our hole .
if you discover that you or your child has eczema , it 's really important to seek professional help for it because a dermatologist , for example , can tell you exactly how to treat it , prevent it , and just to keep a very good skin care regime .i know that , i laugh saying that i spend more time on my daughter 's skin than i do myself , because we want to make sure that she stays eczema free .it 's not fun to have eczema .it 's very irritating .we go through many band-aids , especially on my daughter 's fingers because of the itchiness .when you 're dealing with eczema , whether it 's yourself or your child , i strongly recommend seeing a dermatologist .a dermatologist is a professional who deals with these things , skin disorders , and things like that , on a regular basis .they know exactly what your child needs , or what you need , to prevent and take care of your skin care .when my daughter has an extreme flare up.

so , this is the second leg that we 're going to do.
ok , we 've painted our board for our decoupage mirror .i have two coats of acrylic paint on here.
`` the best way to explain the first three stages of matter is to talk about an ordinary ice cube .an ice cube is a solid ; you ca n't stick your finger through it .this is when the atoms are compacted tightly together , but when the ice cube melts it becomes a liquid and this is when the atoms are spaced further apart and the object takes the only shape that it 's contained in , and in this case it 's a cup .this is when the intermolecular bonds start to break down .so in this case the liquid is obviously called water .the atoms linked are hydrogen and oxygen .get it ?h2o , two parts of hydrogen , one part of oxygen , which is from our periodic table that were going to get to .these are all down to the bones of atoms .when the water evaporates , obviously , it becomes gas .
we add the egg we got the jicama.
then we have to take 13 eggs , crack them open , and put them inside the batter as it gets mixed .we 'll let it mix for a while .we have to stir the eggs before they get in there .just separate them as much as we can .pour them inside and let them mix with the batter .then we have to take one pound of butter , put it in the pan , and heat it up .the batter has to run down and then we have to cool it off.
now i 'm a label.

what you want to do , is do your research , and insurance companies are the companies that do manage annuities .what you can do is go on to rating services on the web .the best rating services to check out are standard and poor 's , you can just basically google that and get standard and poor 's .there 's also the best rating agency , just like it sounds ,best , there 's moody 's , and there 's also fitch , f-i-t-c-h.if you find an insurance professional and he 's licensed , he should be able to provide all the ratings from the best insurance companies for you .then you can independently verify the ratings that you were given by the insurance commissioner in the state that you live .of course , you can call the insurance commissioner and verify the company by name and they will tell you what the ratings are and if there 's any problems with that company for operating in the state that you live in .ratings are very important because it shows the reserve of capital that the insurance company has for the amount of policies and annuities that it has outstanding .the higher the rating , the higher the reserves which means the more safety that you have using your annuities .this is patrick munro talking about the very best ratings of insurance companies .
so if we take and use our imaginations and pretend that we 've got ten dollars in each of containers .one drop of soap representing a dollar bill , and we try to even those out just to try to get the same amount of suds representing cleaning power , we 'll go eleven , twelve , thirteen , we 'll go thirty dollars versus ten dollars .again , i 'm simply trying to get the same amount of suds in each one of these containers representing cleaning power .so three times the amount of soap and we still do n't get as good suds , and notice the clarity of those two waters .which water would you rather bathe in ?which water would you rather have your children bathe in ?which water would you rather have in your home ?that is where that ring in your bathtub comes from .that 's where that soap scum build up comes from .that 's where all of those problems are .the spots on your dishes .the ring in your toilet .all of those things are coming from your quality of water or are effected by your quality of water anyway .

the last thing i want to talk about with regards to social differences that you need to be aware of when you 're dealing with people from other cultures is time .and what i 'm talking about with regards to time is primarily has to do with punctuality .here in america , it 's what we strive for , what is indicative of our culture is to be on time or sometimes on time means five minutes early .but in many , many cultures , being on time means ten minutes late .if we 're supposed to meet at 2:00 , then on time is 2:10 or 2:15 and some cultures.

now , costumes are just things that you wear , but actually , you have to get more into the spirit of being a cat .first off , are you going to try to be ultra agile throughout the evening ?if so , i recommend stretching before you leave .it sounds a little silly , but i have heard of people who were in costumes where the animal is supposed to be more agile , and then all of a sudden they pull out their back or they strain a muscle in their left arm .definitely , make sure you 're not one of those people .if you 're going to be expecting to be really stretching and moving all around , stretch before you go out .you can also start getting your cat mannerisms down .you see the way that cats move .how they stretch certain ways and also how they lick their paws .all of those things .kind of go over .this is a little bit of role you 're going to be playing .while you may look the part , if you 're walking around totally like a human , it 's just not as much fun .of course , do not under emphasis the all important cat activity of scratching .

what i 'm going to talk about is how to treat the sting of the common wasp .the common wasp sting will be characteristic of a great deal of pain , possibly burning and localized redness and swelling to the site area .the site area may have a stinger in it that needs to be removed , by using the backside of a butter knife or credit card to scrape away the stinger from the skin .do not attempt to grab the stinger with a pair of tweezers as this may further envenomate your person or another person that has a stinger in place .check for the stinger relatively quickly , as swelling may occur rapidly and hide a stinger that may still be in place .once the stinger is removed , wash the area with soap and water and possibly use something like rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide to disinfect the area .you can then apply a paste made of backing soda and water to the sting area or even meat tenderizer to help with the healing process and the pain and discomfort .applying ice in ten to fifteen to twenty minute intervals on and off , will also help reduce swelling .benadryl , or some type of anti histamine cream can also be applied to help reduce pain and swelling .i 'm captain joe bruni , stay safe and we 'll see you next time .

i 'm the owner of a local fish store in lindon , utah .the best way to reduce or even eliminate nitrates in a saltwater fish tank is through consistent water changes .nitrates are a natural build up and the end process of the nitrification cycle .the way these build up is usually commonly from fish food , fish waste or other organic material that is decomposing in the tank .make sure that you have enough live rock or other biological filtration to be able to do this efficiently .once again if you do receive a high concentration of nitrates the best thing to do is water change .there are also a few products out there that will also effectively reduce your nitrates in your system .however , these are just a temporary fix and do not provide a long term correction to your problems .by doing constant water changes you are actually taking out a high concentration of nitrate water and reducing the overall concentration of nitrates in your tank by replacing it with 0 amount of nitrates in your new clean , fresh , unpolluted saltwater .

another possible opening style that you can work with and do something fabulous out of would be a style with a center front ring .what that means is this right here.
when they punch , just do a straight punch for now .the idea is to use a block and use the palm to guide the arm , wherever you want it .the cool thing about the outside palm block is , that turns into a grab , very quickly .see , this way you can pull and strike .another interesting use for the palm block is , most people do n't usually punch straight on .mostly skilled fighters know how to punch straight on .a lot of people use this big overhead right technique .yeah , just like that .a lot of people do martial arts who want to know how to defend against the random technique like that .the outside palm block is a very easy way to block against the technique .so do want it slow ?see , just like that .and do a one little faster .see , ooh !just like that .the cool thing again , this technique turns into a grab , very quickly .see here .and then , you can use it to do your throws .outside palm block is a very useful technique when practiced properly .you want to make sure you move from the right to the left or from the left to the right .facing the palm to the outside of the body .that 's how you perform the outside palm block in the praying mantis style .
tadasana the mountain pose is the basic foundation for all of our other standing pose .you can think of it as like the one source out of which all these diversity comes .and so we always want to start in tadasana , as a way to remember the source , even to remember our breath and why we do this practice .this helps us come back to the center.
and this is a funny little balance you can do .we have one hand forward , one hand back.
the next area that we 're going to talk about is trying to keep your shoulders above your knees .the basic stance in boxing , as chad will demonstrate here , is to actually have your heels shoulder width apart .and for some people that of course is going to vary .chad has got about an eighteen inch shoulder width , so his heels should be about eighteen inches apart and.
here 's an independent exercise that you can try .okay , here 's another independent exercise with the shuffle .now , i call this a shuffle also , we call this a hand shuffle .
i 'm going to talk about the uses of a , of a band saw .this type of band saw , this is a vertical band saw .but there 's also a horizontal band saws too , which you can use .and you can use those to cut pipe .you can throw the pipe on there.
theres kimchi from whole cucumbers which is a salting process , there 's kimchi from leaks which is a very delicious salty process.
so little gold angels all around.
so , in craps , you know , you 're , you 're doing.
hi , we 're going to present ourself in tadasana , mountain pose .this pose begins in the soles of your feet .so we 're going to take a look down at the soles of your feet , and see that they are parallel with each other , so they 're not turning out , turning in , balling out , balling in .we want to stay right here , lifting all ten toes , and see if we ca n't ground the soles of your feet ; the whole ball of your foot , as equal as the heel , and then you 'll be able to drizzle all ten toes , melting into the earth .from the soles of your feet , we 're going to look at the ankles ; lifting the ankles , traveling up to the knees ; checking that the ankles are directly below the knees ; traveling up ; that the knees are directly below your hips .continue to travel up , checking that the hips are directly in line with your shoulders .then we want to create space in your neck , lifting from the crown of your head .and then we 're going to drop your shoulders ; relaxing .we 're going to lift the sternum up toward your chin ; opening the heart .begin to strengthen your legs , so that this is a powerful pose .feel the balance equally from right side to left side .feel the strength in your legs , as you continue to lift and lengthen your spine .so if we take a look at this from the side view , you 're going to have a straight line from the shoulder to the hip to the ankle , pausing to just enjoy the pose and re-evaluate .
the next kick boxing technique we 're going to focus on is called our spin side kick .a spin side kick , i 'm going to demonstrate it for you at normal speed.
on breathing now , back to the balloon again , you notice the line .and i taught about the missing cavity back here .just imagine the balloon blowing up only half way .now if i , i squeeze it in here , course i ca n't go that way .but you can tell that , see a balloon does n't operate like that .when you blow it up , it goes all the way out .alright ?so now we have to consciencely think of our diaphragm as a balloon .we have to actually force the muscles back here to go out there .now , generally speaking we do n't develop our latissimus muscles unless you 're a weight lifter.
produce is vegetable or fruit .today we have an onion .an onion needs to be nice and firm all the way around .so obviously what you 're going to do is pick it up and feel it.
i 'll be showing you how to remove and replace a fuel pump on a lincoln continental .o.k , now we 're going to replace our locking ring , that locks the fuel pump in place .lowering it down nice and slowly , you want to see these end grooves that comes from the manufacturer .in this case you 're going to need an assistant to hold two screwdrivers .o.k , now just place one screwdriver right here , and place the other screwdriver right here , press down firmly .now , i 'm going to use the chisel and the hammer to lock it in place , putting the chisel right on the end .that 's right now .when i say apply pressure , then you apply pressure ,o.k .o.k , now we want to apply pressure to the locking rings .i 'm going to take the chisel and the hammer and tap real lightly .and , it 's very important that you get all the lockings tabs locked .you 're going to need to make sure they 're down .
hi , my name is hector inga , owner of lane four swim shop in austin texas , i 've been asked to talk to you about cleaning , or how to clean your swimming goggles .really the care of the swimming goggles are quite simple .our main concern is to get the chlorine or some of the chemicals from the pool and other types of water that you get into , to just to rinse them , rinse as much of the chemicals of the goggles as possible .there 's no need to use soap and water , what we do is just basically dip them in water or rinse them with some tap cold water , clear water .there is not really a cleaner for your lenses , there is an anti-fog spray but that does n't clean them .the rest of the goggles , like lets say the straps , if they get a little grungy you can use a little soapy water , but do not get that on the lenses .in other words , what we want is just to have the inside of the lenses at least just rinsed but not touched .
in this clip we are going to talk about body bags .now a body bag from a hunter 's point of view is not something you carry a body out in but a body bag helps hold your heat in and this item , as far as my hunting items go , is actually my pride and joy of all of my equipment .the body bag even sitting outside , i can stand , because last year i spent six hours in eighteen below weather in this bag with the garments on , that we showed earlier , with those layers of garments .but what the body bag does is it helps protect you from the wind and also help when you close it up .this is a prototype that we are still working on , but they are on the market already .i was looking for one where i can get my hands out to make the shot without actually getting out of the bag .and you could adjust your head gear accordingly , to help maintain your body heat .this body bag will make a tremendous difference in how long you can withstand stay on stand in subzero temperatures .a typical hunt in thirty below temperatures.
and maybe you start picking with your friends.

it 's going to be a happy drink .one , two , three , four , five , six , and that 's my two ounce `` pourer '' .a little bit of grapefruit juice for the gentleman .the reason i want to become a bartender , is , i like , i like making , i like making people happy .i really , really like people .and may , i was a lot more shy before i became a bartender .but , being behind a bar , you 've got a safety net .you know , no , nothing can , you know , even if you make somebody really mad , all they can do is like throw something at you , or yell at you , really .when i 'm making a drink , i know right away , whether someone likes their drink or not .it 's instant gratification , you get money.
okay now we 're going to do the , a clipper work on the dog 's body .and we 're going to start right behind rosie 's head here and go down her neck , with the grain of the hair .and across her shoulders .this is two comb attachment and we 're using a thirty blade underneath the comb attachment .down the front side .you pull the dog 's skin up just a little bit , stretch the skin you can get a nice even cut with the blade that you 're using .it 's always good to brush the dog out before you use a clipper comb .the clipper comb will go down the dog 's body a lot easier .under the neck .and you can go over it as many times as you want to make it nice and smooth .
one of the coolest things about having an ipod video is being able to take videos with you wherever you go .hi.
before we get into that , if you have n't already , please see our other subject matters on looking up calorie expenditure charts , and how to keep track of your calories .all of that factors into this subject , how to burn fat .basically , when you 're burning fat , you 're really burning calories .the less calories you take in , and the more calories you use , in a nutshell , that burns your fat .that calls upon your extra energy reserves , and your extra energy reserves , are calories that have n't been used , and calories that have n't been used , turns into fat .what you want to do , is use those up , so in one of our other subjects , we talked about activity factors .all right , so i 'm going to go back to that , and relate it to this subject .so for instance , i 'm a factor twenty , because i work out more than an hour a day , more than three times a week .factor twenty times my target weight , which is a hundred and fifty .twenty times a hundred and fifty , is three thousand calories , but let 's say that i wanted to lose even more weight .i have to say this is a misnomer .for my height , one hundred and fifty , is a healthy weight .for me to lose weight , is actually unhealthy , so.
ok.now let 's talk about turning the compost pile .well , if it 's all good , and you put this pile together right , you do n't have to turn the compost pile .because , if you layered it right , and you watered it right , and you got your microorganisms in there , and you put the compost inoculate in there , you should n't have to turn this pile .now , obviously , this is a brand new pile that we just made today .but , if for some reason your pile did n't cook down , which means if your pile is four feet high , when it 's finished it should be about a foot and a half high .and it should cook down , and it should go down , and you should be able to see that it looks like compost , not like this material .but if you come across your pile , and it has n't done those things , then you 're going to want to turn your pile .the way we would do that is we would do just like we did in the beginning .we would put holes in the ground so it would drain good .we would create -- add some more sticks , which we 've run out of .but we have plenty in the woods .you would add your leafy -- your garden debris for aeration .and then you would start to turn your pile .you would take the top and you would put it on the bottom , just like this .and if you felt like you wanted to really get going again , that it was n't going quite good enough , then you could go to your garden , do some more weeding , add some more green material in there in the middle .then you would continue to shovel all this , as you can see , and turn it over .if you come across any debris that might be still too bulky , then that 's what this nice fork is .you can smash it , bust it up , put it back in the pile .continue to turn the pile until it 's completely turned and the bottom is now on the top .
ok.i 'm going to show you something that you 're going to use when you 're going to be changing between your instruments.
notice on this part.
actually calories are units of energy and so to be honest , just the act of breathing is using calories .but our focus of course , is how to burn calories presumably for weight loss .remember when you are trying to think of everyday ways to burn calories you are calorie counting so every activity has a calorie count value .for everyday ways would be things like housework , garden work , parking a little farther.
i 'm going to come in to the nice knee stretch here .so i 'm going to reach down , grab underneath carrie 's knee , lift the heel and bend the knee , setting off to the side .now i want to place the opposite leg over her leg for a little bit of control .and then i place same side leg underneath .now literally underneath her knee with my toes pointing out , i 'm going to grab a hold of her heel.
just like the time before i talked to you about adjusting to the lanes and everything like that , we are also going to help you find the strike lane as well .now are good strike lane would consist of you throwing the ball and it would basically be in fluent into the bucket where you can get strikes .i have just thrown a couple of balls and have found a strike , so we are going to throw a good ball here .like the time before remember to wipe off your ball of the oil .i got a little bag here to keep the moisture off my hands , that is to make sure i grip the ball good .now line up to your shot , be square to your mark , have a good grip on the ball , now follow through .good strike .now with that i adjusted to the lanes like i did with the clip before , and i found my strike lane .you do that on both sides you will be pretty well set .just pick up your spares and you will do good .
just like any other muscle group , especially the chest because it is a larger muscle group , you need to warm up your body and warm up your chest .so you can start with a nice walk on a treadmill with a with an incline , doing some jumping jacks or some other calisthethenics or push ups would help warm up those chest muscles .once they are nice and warm because you never want to stretch a cold muscle , we will our basic stretches .carrie is going to start out with her chest stretch .she is going to interlace her fingers behind her back .she is going to pull her arms up nice and slow.
you 'll need when you shop is some sort of turn tables .a lot of stores will have there own turn table set up .there own listening stations set up , so you can preview music .but also on the same note a lot of them do n't .this is something i brought to take care of the latter part of that problem .it 's a numark portable turntable .essentially what it is , it 's just a turntable for the go .it can plug in to any outlet .comes with its own power supply or you can put in your own batteries in the back .i believe it takes six d batteries .typically when i shop i like to look for singles for a lot of reasons .there a lot cheaper .you know it 's usually going to be six dollars for a single compared to any where from twenty to twenty five dollars for a full length album and also you get the song that you want .there 's one song you picked .it 's on this record , the instrumental , the radio version , the album version , sometimes even an ocapella .whereas the full length you have the whole album .there might be songs that you do n't want to play and you do n't even ever use .so it can be a waste of money .than of course there 's the scratch album that we looked at earlier .so where this comes into play essentially is , you can set up in any record store .it 's a compact and on the move .as you can see here it 's got an on and off button to turn it on and if you do n't want to annoy everyone at the record store.
and we are in new york city .today on behalf of expert village , i 'm going to show you how to apply makeup for stage .now we 're going to finish off by lining with the red .you can see that this is a really bright red color .kind of fill it in .do your top lip making sure to kind of get pretty close to your natural peaks .almost done .i 've pretty much filled in all of the inside of my lips , and now we 're going to actually add the lipstick and work from there .

in this clip , we 're going to talk about just general placement of the board on the beach you know ,when you want to put it down , you want to make sure that you do it in a nice , soft fashion , you 're not going to damage or scuff the board up .you can be relatively rough with them , but like i said before , it 's an investment and you want to preserve that .things you want to look for on the beach , are sort of drift lines , you see all of these shells right here lining the beach .when the tide comes up , it 's going to , the waves are going to push up all of those shells and a lot of sharp things , and then it 's going to recede and leave all of that stuff there .if you drag it over it , it 's going to basically act like some really , really rough sand paper , and it 's actually going to take off the bottom of the board a lot faster than it would normally do .two different ways to pick the board up , you can either pick it up from one end , and flip it onto its top like this , find the sweet spot and then pick it up .but , if you do that enough times you 're actually going to wear off the nose of the board which we just had to repair before .so , the best way to do it is the same way with a canoe.

now the next thing we could do is try to fill in the track .now let 's look at these apple loops one more time and see what else we can add in , maybe add in some type of electric thing .let 's try a little bass right here and let 's try to drag down and extend it .
but it 's for glass .now , the kiln can be used in a couple different ways .the number one way it can be used is to anneal your glass works .now annealing is when you take glass to a temperature and then drop it till it reaches room temperature .now the annealing temperature of the glass that we 're working with is one thousand and fifty degrees fahrenheit .beyond that , when using a kiln , you may place your work in a kiln , while in the midst of working , to take a break or create something else and add it on .this can be very helpful when working on much larger pieces .
so , in this next part you 'll see again a big movement of the spine from backward bending to forward flexion and how these poses really go together .first , the crescent moon .as i 'm easing out that side ,i 'm.

so now we 're going to practice this first finger scale on the d , and your elbow is going to adjust just a little bit .and so again , we 're practicing the d major scale , just in a slightly different way .and as you 'll see , as your hand is going up the scale , your hand is starting to have to go around the violin more to reach it , and that 's what you want to do .that 's the movement that you want to have .you do n't want to come up , and try and keep your fingers going up that way .it 's going to be slightly uncomfortable .but you want your whole hand to be moving , and your thumb is going to actually start resting right here in kind of the crook of the neck , and then your hand is going to come around to continue reaching .so that 's the kind of movement that you want as you 're going up in your scale with your first finger .
droppings look like a little pepper , that 's kind of dribbled all over the place .often , if the roaches are really bad , you 'll find them all over your cabinets , inside , outside .what we 're going to do is we 're going to be checking and showing you how we do the treatment , underneath the sink area .as we inspect underneath the kitchen sink , you check for all the little crevasses and corners .when we begin treating , we use our hand sprayer , i 've changed the material in it , and we spray around the edges and corners , trying to get any place where the roaches may be hiding and where they are .i have a machine here.

next i 'm going to use a little bit of turquoise paint .just a lighter blue and give our face a little bit of a like eye shadow .so we 're doing it along the line of our pink eye marking and over the white and just a little bit of a swoosh .ok.now we 'll use a little dark blue and give the eye to the center of the eye .and the placement of that eye will , you know , kind of give the direction where the puppet will be looking .so , you want to think about that a little bit where you 're going to place that blue dot .it changes the expression depending upon where you put it .and again we want to let that dry before we put the next color on .now we 'll finish off our puppet face with some detailing .and i 'm going to use a brown color .and i 'm just watering it down a tiny bit and.

part of the challenge of doing the foliage is that there is so much going on that it 's hard to keep it all straight .so , let 's keep it simple .we 've drawn that one in the center .let 's establish the ones that are clearly sub-visible , the ones that are nearby , like that group under this group of flowers .and not worry about what 's going on in the background .we 'll worry about what 's going on in the background after we 've established the basic shapes of the primary leaf groups .that leaf group has a large area of a pure green .and let 's establish that dark edge along the very bottom which establishes its serrated edge .for that group .and now that we 've established the basic shape that it has.
the next thing we are dealing with is rotating the tires .now what rotating the tires does is it promotes even wear of the tire 's surface .if you start off with new tires you want to rotate your tires regularly .we usually do this maybe every 6 or 7 ,000 miles just to insure that you have proper tire wear .basically what you do depending on what kind of vehicle application you have is you want to take on some german cars you just rotate the tires side from side.
and now for a couple of stupid criminal tricks .first we have a pair of seniors , sixty-five in new york , whose pal suddenly died .he had his three hundred and fifty-five dollar social security check uncashed .so you know what they did ?they put him in a wheelchair , wheeled him down to the local check cashing center , and they were going to try to pass him off as still alive so they could get that money .however , when they entered , a policeman , a plain clothesman , spotted the body and realized that the man in the chair was dead , and they were arrested .stupid criminal trick .now i have another case , a woman down in new zealand was in a store.
hi , my name is ashley ludman from seaside yoga , here to tell you a little bit about power yoga .power yoga is a system of vinyasa yoga which means you 're linking your movements in moving pretty steadily from one pose to the next .so with that , you have to create a sustain breath , called ujjayi breath , which i 'll demonstrate in just a moment .and with power yoga you 'll create a balance between strength and flexibility .you 're using your internal heat to sustain the benefits of the hot internal practice .so in vinya or in power yoga rather , you 're using not just flexibility in trying to go deeper into the postures , but you 're trying to use your strengths to sustain yourself in the posture .so ujjayi breath is created by a gentle toning of the throat muscles and it creates a sound similar to a dark vader sound or an ocean sound if you hold a cup shell up to your ear .it sounds something like this .and this ujjayi breath helps to regulate your internal focus and the heat within movement between posture to posture .i 'll demonstrate just a little bit of power yoga , you can join with me if you want to .so we 'll start at the beginning of the mat , at the front of the mat , place your hands to your heart and engage your ujjayi breath .also , you want to engage your deep core muscles to help you sustain the posture from the center , from the core .breathing in , stand tall , and exhale fold forward to uttanasana , standing forward bend .then inhale , strongly lengthen your spine , look forward , exhale fold back and place your hands and jump back to plank .from here you can lower yourself and hover in chaturanga , breathing steadily .inhale slide forward and come up to upward facing dog .exhale , engage from your core and stretch back to downward facing dog .bend your knees , look forward and step or hop lightly .inhale and stretch forward .exhale , fold forward .inhale and rise .exhale , hands to heart .now you may repeat that cycle a few times before coming into some of the strengthening , standing postures .and that is the sun salutation , it helps to create increased heat and it helps to loosen up the body 's joints , the hips and the shoulders and the spine so that you can sustain more of the static poses in a stronger way .i 'll just give you one more pose that you might see in a power yoga class.
we have now pinned the light weight suede fabric that would be the center piece to the leopard print.

so this king pigeon , which i 've been calling big pigeon , because the front of the shin is parallel with the front of the mat .and if you pull the heel in closer , it 's really a different pose because of the structure of the muscles of off .so a lot of folks want to pull in , but , it 's never going to cultivate this position if you do that .so i think it 's better just to work with what you have and be patient .so i have a lot of variations to help students open .we do quite a bit of this in the class .the first is to simply work with the spine .you know , you may find your pelvis is n't really pointing where you want it to point , it 'd be nice if we just lie flat , maybe it 's not lying flat , maybe it 's pointing out to the sides somewhere .you 're all uneven .in this case , lead with the head , take your head where you 'd want to want it to go and let the spine follow .think of this as time lapse photography , may not happen all in one session , it may take a period of months to open up this way , but , pulling the head where i want it to go .eventually , the spine and then the pelvis will follow .and also , notice i 'm pulling , i 'm holding on with these back toes.
i 'm jk dooley and.
off season training for football .stiff legged dead lifts with dumbbells .this is the beginning our third superset for this workout .we 're going to take a pair of dumbbells , because we 're also going to help develop scapulas stability while doing the dead lift .so jones is going to take the two dumbbells , he 's going to stand with his feet hip width apart , he 's going to start looking straight out at the horizon and then push his hips straight back keeping a stiff lower back and then push the hips forward .feel that your heels push down and into the ground and back .it 's really going to help develop strength through the gluts and the hamstrings .that will help translate over for speed for you and also help condition your hamstrings to prevent injury .he 's keeping his chest nice and big and wide open as he 's working .we 're going to do ten reps of these before moving on to renegade rose .
we are going to go and stir all of our vegetables so that they are nice and incorporated and once they are more or less we will come on to our baking sheet and pour our items on the top.
we 're going to continue now with stringing a guitar .we had just found that holding the string up about 3 inches above the neck is about as much slack as you need , while keeping the string from going through the tuning peg with the left hand .once you have that , hold the string with your right hand so that it does n't move , hold the guitar up , and begin tuning the string by making sure that it goes around the outside before around the inside .you 'll notice that the string comes up along the outside of the headstock .hold it with your right hand , so you 're pulling it tight , and the first time around , this is my personal preference , a lot of people do this their own ways , but , i like to go over the string the first time through.
we 're here today with henry.
okay .now that we have our produce cut , we have our green onions , our yellow , green peppers , our lettuce , tomatoes , red onions , and cilantro , now we 're ready to cook the meat .so what we 're going to do first.
ok , a lot of times you may notice pro golfers at a tournament , they reach down , they grab some grass , and then they toss it up like that .so that 's going to give them , the reason they do that , it 's going to give them the direction of the wind.
what we 're talking about right now is the jobs and the duty of our point guard .now our point guard has many responsibilities .one is to get the offense started , one is to be the general on the floor , but sometimes , after the point guard gives the ball away to a wing player or a post player.
here are two recipes for making massage bars .these are probably the most popular bars as mostly everybody will appreciate one after a hard day 's work .and the first one we 're going to make is using the olive oil ; clear olive oil .we have three ounces melted here and we 're going to add a teaspoon of this apricot seed and a couple drops of the camel meal fragrance.
i 'm an aesthetician and makeup artist at ulta salon and cosmetics.
front side fifty-fifty on a ledge .a front side fifty-fifty is when you ollie onto a ledge .and , you grind using both of your trucks at the same time .front side is a name for when a ledge trick is done , when you approach the ledge and it 's on your front side .back side , would of course be behind you on your backside .to do the front side fifty-fifty , you 'll want to approach the ledge in a front side way .this means that the ledge is on your facing side .so , you approach the ledge and you setup in the ollie position .you 're going to want to make sure that you can ollie as high as whatever it is that you 're getting onto .and , maybe even a little bit higher .you 're going to ollie up and above what you 're getting onto .and , then direct your weight and body to a front side position .while doing a fifty-fifty in a front side position , you 're going to want to put most of your weight on your toes .this is what ends up keeping you on the ledge .and , then you keep grinding forward until your speeds run out .from that position , you 're going to have to do a small ollie to get off from the ledge and into the clear .and , be able to roll away .so , you 'll maybe while you 're grinding you can adjust your feet and setup for the ollie out .one foot on the tail and one foot just below the front bolts .and , then ollie away from it out of the fifty-fifty .and , then roll away .
in this clip , we 'll talk about hydrophobia .hydrophobia is a fear of water , and is more common than you think .it can range from being afraid to go in the ocean , to going in a pool , to the more severe level of even staying away from taking a bath .now hydrophobia a lot of times can be linked to a past trauma .for example , if when you were a child you almost drowned , or you saw someone else almost drown , that could that could be the trigger that might have led to your fear of water .so in that case , if that 's your specific trigger , you might need to talk about different ways to stay safe .you know , maybe you 're afraid of swimming because you do n't know how to swim , and some of the things you could do is as simple as learning how to swim .you know , take some swimming lessons with a certified instructor , with lifeguards on duty , and then once you learn how to swim.
hi , we 're here again .we are with the ar-15 rifle and we are going to go over disassembly .as we always do , you want to make sure that the rifle is safe , pointed in a safe direction as you make sure that it is unloaded by dropping the magazine out , inspecting the chamber to make sure that there 's nothing in it .right now , we 're going to take it apart .and to take this particular rifle apart , there 's two pins located on the back and the front of the rifle .all you have to do is from the reverse side , push those two pins out , and it will separate the upper receiver and the lower receiver .so , we 're going to do that right now , pushing the back pin out .we 're taking the front pin out .
today we 're going to be talking about cleaning and protecting dance shoes , point shoes , ballet shoes , you know , jazz style tap shoes , that sort of thing .we 'll start out with a , this is a basic dance shoe .what you 'd want to do with a shoe like this , it 's kind of hard because it 's a metallic .when you clean and protect a metallic shoe , you can use just a neutral polish .this is a leather shoe , or you can use a metallic polish .the metallic polishes have to be a pretty close match to look correct .you do n't want a tremendous amount of difference in the appearance of the shine between the two .when applying a polish to a shoe like that , you just rub it in.
what you want do is make sure that on the computer with the printer you need to go into your system preferences and make sure that it  s actually shared so that you can print to it from other places .we need to under our system preference open up sharing .make sure that printer sharing is enabled under our services tab .what you want to do is once you  re on the system.
the weight of the rod is going to depend upon the weight of the line that we 're casting , and that is going to be determined by the size of the fly that we 're going to cast .so for instance , if we have a big bushy fly , okay , then you 're going to want a heavier line , like a six weight line that has more thickness in it , in its body to be able to turn that fly over .if you 're fishing a very , very small dry fly like the size of your fingernail , then a rod that will cast a three or a four weight line ; it 's going to cast a very little , fine fly very easily .now , to expand on that , is like a six weight line , which is large diameter ; it will very easily cast a small fly the size of your fingernail , though the presentation or how it fishes will not be quite as nice , okay ; whereas , if you take a small diameter three or four weight line , it will not be able to push a big , bushy fly through the air because there 's more mass to it .in other words , to to for that to be able to happen is when you start out , you get a rod that matches the line weight that you , and the size of the flies that you 're planning on fishing , so what what it starts out to is the rod manufacturer will have written on the rod four weight rod , and then , so you start out trying to put a four weight line on it .now , the next thing we want to talk about is the weight of the rod .so the weight of the rod , that 's going to be go in hand with the balance of how the reel , when you hold the rod by the handle , how comfortable it feels to you .is the tip heavy ?is it the reel.
so right now i 'm going to do two or three hundred yards warm-up swim .and so then the next part of the warm-up is usually a couple hundred yards of kicking .with the warm-up portion of your swim do n't be afraid to include some different strokes .even though in a triathlon you only use the front crawl , in the interest of varying your training and working on rotation , it 's a good idea to include some backstroke and even some breast stroke for flexibility .kick for the triathlon is something that you need to pay attention to because you need a short , shallow kick .once you put on your wet suit , your legs are going to float real high in the water and to expend a lot of energy to kick would be very detrimental to the bike and run legs .so , work on just a short , shallow , steady kick .
we are going to show you how to dance the hustle .now we are going to show you the sent out from the closed position .you want to remember , the leader is now starting with the side break .while the follower is doing a back break .we will show you the pattern first .one , two three and one bring back into the close position .to make sure that you can catch onto the foot work .the leader will show you the first of the foot work .side break cross together back.
all right .so beat three.
so we 're going to talk a little bit about stretches that you can do with your horse that will help to compliment the other body work that you are doing that can be part of your horse 's total exercise fitness program .we will talk about doing stretches that will stretch the horse 's neck and top line area .stretches that you can do with the forelegs .stretches that can help with your horse 's abdominals as well as the back area and stretches that are going to help loosen up the horse 's hamstring area , their hind legs .just make them feel a little bit more comfortable all the way around .you need to make sure that when you are doing the stretches on your horse you never want to do them on a horse that is cold .you want to make sure that you 've warmed your horse up first even if it 's just something as simple as a little walk around your yard or something like that .get those muscles loosened up and do n't try to over stretch your horse , if they start to show resistance to what you are doing , you need to back off , if you force the stretch you will probably hurt your horse .
okay , now we 're going to connect this back in .just always start it by hand .if there 's a resistance there 's a problem .do n't just go ahead and force it .and just snug it up slightly .okay , now let me slide over here.
in this clip , we 're going to be doing the pendulum swing with the exercuff .so you want to come down slowly on the mat .if you do n't already have your excercuffs on , you might want to put them on at this point .okay .come down to the prone position on the mat .there are a number of options .you can have your palms down on the mat or you can come down on to your forearms .okay .now we are going to take our rear leg , extend pass the opposite leg and swing it across .so you are going to be touching down on two different points .touching down passed the opposite leg and then across .you can make this fast or slow .you just want to watch your back and keep your back nice and stable.
and if you travel to any of these cities on an evening out , you might find yourself in a spanish restaurant where part of the activity for the evening will be a flamenco show .what makes flamenco particularly interesting is the influences of other dance forms that have helped to create it .we know that the earliest settlers in andalucia , came , not only from the middle east and from north africa , and besides the persians , the moors and the arabs , there was a strong immigration of people who came in from the north of india.
before you head out for a long distance road trip the first thing you should do is go over everything inside of your engine bay and make sure all the fluid levels are appropriate .check your coolant level , your air conditioning , your washer fluid for your windows , your power steering fluid , and check your engine oil and see if it is the proper level or if it needs to be changed .also , check your brake fluid , cause ' you do n't want to lose your brakes while you 're drivin ' .and if you have a hydraulic clutch or a stick car the cylinder 'll be somewhere in this area ; near the brake .also , check the spark plug wires and the boots to make sure they 're not burnt , and make sure they 're not old , worn , or cracked .and also , check your battery connection terminals and make sure they 're secured , cause ' a loose connection will make it so you 'll lose power .check your air filter , and also check your transmission fluid which should be located right in the back of the engine compartment if you have a rear wheel drive car , and a front wheel drive car should also be somewhere around here ; near the transmission area .so , before you go on a road trip just check all your fluids , check your spark plug wires , and make sure everything 's all in working order and all the levels are good , and all the fluids are at a high quality .
next step once you have your ridge pole cut out , and you have your wide stick ready to go , like i showed you earlier , notch it in there , lock it in .now lay inside here .and the reason you want to lay down in here , before you go any further with this debris hut , just make sure you fit.
i moved out here seven years ago from osaka , japan .i studied linguistics when i was in college , and i 've been tutoring from students to adults who are travelling to japan , and i 've been working as a translator .and i hope you learn some japanese and start using it .and in the previous show , we learned how to greet in japanese and also we learned some very useful sentences , which you can use in japan .and in this show , i want you to learn how to describe about you and about the person and about your surroundings .i hope you enjoy this show , and let 's start .
let 's take a look .on the introductory riff , we 're going to start with our index finger on the 5th fret of the a string .then we 're going to put our ring finger.
let 's take a closer look at our , where we are going to turn a tenon in other words this gripping spigot here in our chuck .now that is going to go down inside that and what we need to do is measure.
just regular oats like oatmeal and just put that in there and mix it .blend it .next we are going to get the cinnamon.
i 'll add that and as well as the feta and mint to top the salad which looks and smells delicious .
this cocktail is called lugger .go ahead and start off by putting your ice and your mixing glass like so .then we are going to do one ounce of apple brandy , one ounce of apple brandy.
you want to open up the lymph nodes .you take that strap , again it 's not stretchy.
in this clip i 'm going to be demonstrating a 6 stroke roll .a 6 stroke roll is as it implies 6 hits ; 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 .
front side nose slide on a ledge .front side nose slide means that you 're going to do a nose slide.
now i have my other side of my scarf all decorated the way i want it .and i 've done one more thing .which is , i 've put my two layers of bubble wrap together on the same side .the trick to this is to have your bubble wrap with the flat sides together and when you roll everything up.
in virabhadrasana or the warrior one pose , one of the things , that i notice when i 'm teaching , is a lot of people using their arms incorrectly .we often see rounded arms or just sloppy arms .an important part of this pose is to get the energetic flow lengthening up toward the sky .in order to do this , you have to use the arms properly .i will now ask faith , my assistant , to come into warrior one pose for us .first , she will bring her right foot forward and bending through her right knee .she will shoot her right knee forward toward the front edge of the mat .notice how her knee stays in line and not in or out to the side .we are going to square faith 's hips , so that she is not in warrior one and one half , with her hips over to the side nor warrior two .she is in warrior one with full hips to the center .she is pressing in , to the little toe , to the heel and to the back left foot .this will activate the energy on the outside of the leg .inhaling , she will fully extend both arms over her head .to make sure that we do n't have sloppy arms , i 'll have faith grab this block and press her hands in on each side of the block .this allows her to engage her biceps and her triceps .in this pose her biceps are up near her ears .inhale and lengthen , just a little bit .exhale and sink a little bit more and perhaps take her extended arms back just a tad more .if she can she should take her arms back just beyond her ear .using the block can help bring your arms into proper alignment .
hi this elise mcmahon for expert village in this video series we are going to be talking living in a multi dog household .
okay , so now i 've got my pattern all cut out .here it is , like a little jig-saw puzzle on the table .i 've got it assembled correctly , right , because i numbered it ahead of time .one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fourteen .i could have numbered it anyway.
so even though we just talked about how this space has a lot of challenges in terms of storage , there is actually a lot of potential for adding storage in here .the greatest potential probably comes from the refrigerator .refrigerators since they are magnetic there are a lot of storage options for actually putting magnets on your refrigerator that hold herbs or utensils that kind of thing .the top of the refrigerator always good for storage .there are a couple of different options that i 'll get into later to create storage using these , these shelves thingies and then also the biggest thing that 's working over here for me anyway is the window .so i 've got a lot of light over here and also this space , even though it is a small space .i can choose what i put in there , so there are a lot of options of things that i can put in there .
cindy mastry :gomukasana or cow face pose is a really great pose to release tension through the hips .faith is going to demonstrate how to do the lower half.
the proper way to set up is to have the mike behind the speaker .another thing is you want to provide some distance between the speaker and the people in the front row because you do n't want the sound to overwhelm them .for the mixer , a bad set up i commonly see is having the mixer behind the speakers .in this position you ca n't hear what the audience hears .and you may not even be able to hear if a speaker fails .another thing is you 're a distraction in this position because you 're in the sight line of the audience .from this position if you want to hear both speakers you 're going to have to move in front of them which again is distracting to the audience .a good set up for the mixer is where you can hear both speakers simultaneously .and the best place for this is in the back of the room at the center .so that covers where you should place your speakers and your mixer .
i 'm beau timken , master sake sommelier .and we 're speaking about daiginjos in this segment .specifically we 're talking about ,hey , how can i taste daiginjo and when is it available in the united states ?i 've picked three brews ,by no means are we limited to three sakes .there are , i would say , are more than two hundred and fifty daiginjos to choose from .but i picked these three because they all specialize in certain different capacities .the first is a very famous wakatake the onigroroshi , the demon slayer from shizoka prefecture .great people , great brewery and.
and we 're going to roll out a thin log .and this is probably the easiest thing you 'll ever sculpt because a butterfly body is pretty easy.
good , now we 're ready to cut a slot from this mark to this mark .it 's going to be 1/2 inch wide and.
in this step , we 're going to take a look at how to use the wire brushes on the cymbals .and we 're going to take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of using the wire brushes on the cymbals .now first , let 's just hear how they sound .and on the ride .okay , that 's how wire brushes sound just hitting the cymbal regularly .some advantages is if we 're going to do a cymbal roll , kind of can give you a unique type of texture .as you can see , the cymbal 's not really ringing much , but you 're still getting that sheen of the cymbal .and that 's probably the real ,i guess advantage to using the wire brush on the cymbal , because they are quiet , so it 's hard to hear -- if you 're playing a beat .i mean ,i 'm hitting it pretty hard.
so while i 'm making my decision about my piece to work on , again , within the same idea and context of what i was working within this piece , i am choosing to just border off certain specific areas of collaging .so here you can see i 've sort of chosen these egg like shapes which are a little bit harder to work with as you have to sort of rip off smaller pieces of tape in order to border off the edges .but they are a little more interesting of a shape to work with rather than a standard square .so you can see how i 've sort of worked the shape and the direction of all the materials inside of those shapes in order to work with that .but then for this piece that i 'm working with today , i 've chosen to do just one box frame , and i want to make sure that my box frame is some.
be in the moment !what do i mean by that ?well i remember one time i was doing a casting for a huge project and an actress came in and said , `` oh my gosh.
we are going to start with a warm up that i like to do .my coach at the university pretty much showed me how to do this , but it 's very basic .it 's basically run a little , slow do n't start too hard .i like to come here to the line , come back here .now , what i 'm going to do is do a warm up on the side .lateral movement is very important on tennis court .so , we 're going to start warming up for that .basically what we do ; we stay on our toes , we move laterally , and we just kind of jump in our toes .so , let me start that over.
okay so now i 'm going to use another toner out here today .i 'm going to use some good old coffee .i made a big rather strong pot of coffee that i am going to tone some prints in .right now , i 'm going to take some cyanotypes and tone them in the coffee .i have two which i am just going to let sit .and i just want them to get covered all the way .now just like the tea that we had done earlier , it takes a little while .but i can already see how the coffee is hitting in this paper.
ok.when it comes to action , which is the string height above the frets .there are a whole bunch of variables that effect that action .one of them is the straightness of the neck .second variable is the neck pitch angle .that 's the angle of the neck relative to the body .third variable is the height of the nut .the fourth variable is the height of the saddles , right here .the saddle position also effects the action .forward and backwards as well as how well it ?s sitting in the guitar body .the fret heights is another one of the variables that effects the action .that 's the height of the frets .frets come in various different size heights .some people like high frets .other people like low frets .low frets are good for fast action guitars .high frets are favored by players that like the older vintage style instruments .the nut slot radius is another factor .that 's the size of the nut slot .as well as the nut slot depth as another variable .and the last variable is the type of bridge and the attachment of this kind of bridge or the kind of bridge that it has to the instrument .this happens to be a whammy bar kind of bridge like on a stratocaster .this other instrument has a fixed type bridge .and sometimes these bridges can be loose or not tightened down tight enough , so they slop around a little bit .and so those are the variables that affect the height of the strings above the frets which we know as action .
my name 's alex.
in this clip , i 'm going to talk a bit about what i 'm wearing .some of the costumes , this is some of the traditional wear that you will see african dancers and drummers wear .the beads that are adorning my bra right here are actually cowrie shells and they are very popular in different parts of west africa , many years ago , they used to be used as currency , or money .not used as money today but used as beautiful jewelry and things to go on costumes .also , this is from senegal , and this is raffia , it is a colored raffia , a different kind of raffia .most raffia you 're going to see is going to be brown.
we formed the rice cakes but we 're not going to cook them right now because our chicken is going to take just a little bit longer .so we 've taken our chicken which is marinated , we 're making sure that everything is still covering the chicken .then we are going to go and turn our front burner on up to about six.
now i am going to demonstrate how to do astral posture in leg region .so very simple , not difficult .comfortable way , your leg stretch , both leg stretch , and your hands be comfortable ,your hand is free , not to any specific reason you support , you feel comfortable your hand in the back side so you can support with your hand and after your close your feet .and inhaling is very important .in the feet area you concentrate this astral postures in the toes area , inhaling your own fingers , inhale and hold , exhale toes down , inhale toes up , exhale toes down , inhale toes up , exhale toes down , inhale toes up , exhale toes down .full stretch.
so here we 're going to start talking about the four ball half shower .now this is significantly different than any of the other four ball tricks we 've talked about so far in that each throw is going to cross hands .you 're not going to be throwing right to.
now the the zeppelin bend starts into a series of a family of knots that uses the overhand bend .now , a bend is a way of tying two ropes together and so you can actually loosen them up , so the cords do n't bind .because in the old days , cords were very , very rare , and it 's something that you really wanted to keep .so what we 're going to do here is i have two ropes here to demonstrate my zeppelin bend .what i 'm going to is i 'm going to take these two ropes .and in my hand , do it like this , i 'm going to create a loop with both of them .now-oh , i 'm sorry .let 's just do it like this .let 's create a bend like this .and we 'll just start with one .and what we 're going to do is we 're going to wrap it around both and create just a single overhand knot such as this .as you can see here , just in the red line , just a simple overhand knot .now , what we 're going to do is , we 're going to take the standing end of my blue rope and pull it over .what we 're going to do is we 're going to wrap this around like this and create a overhand bend as it loops through both of them again .as you can see , both of them have looped through each other , to create two overhand bends in separate knots .so what we 're going to do is we 're just going to pull these together.
i mean if this really were fitzcarraldo from the werner herzog film he would have a nice little white suit , kind of a black narrow tie .there is that fedora .it might be hard to make a fedora for a sock monkey .but still , but you can do whatever you want .you can make vests , skirts , hats .hats are optional .but you could put buttons on him ; i have got all kinds of buttons here .you could i mean shoot.
in a slightly steeper and more technical trail , like the one i just rode with the rocks and roots in it , you can see that my upper body was higher and rotated back .instead of being really low and over the front , i 'm still aggressive and attacking the trail , but.
so if you want to change your stock stem out for something different.
the other thing that i forgot to cover is the tire sealant .now what this does right here is say if you were riding down the highway and you had a small obstruction.
after we 've done our research at the local aquarium and you 've read some books at the library , we 're ready to start getting our ideas down on paper and by this.
in this clip , we 're going to talk about the proper way to flush your cooling system .in this step , we 're going to talk about the proper service procedure for hooking up your back flow prevention valve , your garden hose and your drain hose to the radiator cap .your back flow prevention valve is going to go on one way .the black end is going to meet up to the `` t '' that you installed on the inlet of your heater core/heater hose .unscrew the sealing cap , and screw the back flow valve down tight .then , we screw our garden hose into the connection here .the garden hose is what applies the back flow pressure , just using your household water pressure , into the system to reverse flush all of the contamination out of it .what i 'm going to do now is take my splash deflector , and i have a chunk of garden hose here installed ; and move my radiator cap , and install that into the field neck of the radiator .it 's just going to snap right in , just like so .i also have a bucket here to catch the old contaminated coolant .go ahead and set it up just like that .you 're going to want to use a bucket to catch the overflow coolant .it 's a felony to dispose of it on the ground or dump it out .you can recycle it at some part stores or at oil change facilities .that is the proper way to hook your vehicle up for the flushing process .
i am going to give you , with all of these variations , the technical name for these styles .personally i might not be that much of an expert , because i do n't know them as these .i 've never .i 've heard of them as a bishop sleeve , which is what i 'm going to show you right now .but i would n't know to call it that .i would just call it a poofy sleeve .i guess its not very technical , but this is going to be a bishop sleeve .and you 'll see in the dash lines here , i have the actual outline of the arm .that 's where if fabric on the sleeve were sheer , you would see the arm right here .bishop sleeve , you are going to want to blouse it a little .its going to be a little bit more flowy .think like almost a poet sleeve .i do n't really know where the term bishop is referenced from .but , we 'll pretend .so , you are going to have the arm , like in the dash lines .and then just follow the lines of the arm out a little bit .basically .and then here you have more of a frump curvature down to your cuff where it tightens again .there you go .
as we  re shampooing the male head , what you want to do with his hair.
so , even though i 've said it 's not worth restoring a bike , of course people still want to do it .and cases where people generally will really restore a bike is if they still have their childhood bike , and they want to make it look as they remember it sitting under the christmas tree in 1963.and if you 've if you 're choosing to do a full restoration , a good question is am i going to be able to find the parts i need ?well , you certainly can , particularly if you 're looking at something from like the 30 's up to the 1970 's .parts before the 1930 's are hard to find .this this schwinn , which i showed you a little while ago , it does have some bad chips in the paint .if you look at the chain guard , i 'm not sure that you can see this.
so moving on from the glue sticks .you are going to move into using your gel mediums or gloss medium .again these are acrylic based.
can you look through this book and see if you can find something that uses descriptive writing for us ?teacher pay is varied by the level of education , and their year 's of experience .here in nashville , i think the base pay starts at $ 35 to $ 36 ,000 with a bachelors , and runs all the way up into the fifties and sixties .in houston , the base pay for a first year teacher with a college degree is $ 46 ,000 , and it runs into the seventies .but it 's different throughout the nation .the starting salary for a teacher is on average between $ 35 ,000 and $ 45 ,000 .from what i 've seen right now , it 's capping in the $ 50 to $ 70 ,000 range , depending on the district you 're in .it 's dependent on how many years experience you have , sometimes in district as well as in education altogether .and it also depends on your level of education .it 's going to grow as long as they keep having children .
little flip of the tin , happy tin , happy drink .stir it a little bit , throw on some champagne .nice .put a cherry on that , little lemon action .when you talk about what 's the funniest thing that you 've encountered behind the bar or funny things that have happened , bartenders are going to laugh every single day because it does n't matter .i mean you want to keep your people safe but when people get a little intoxicated.
first of all you want to start with a good base .good foundation to throw from .once you get that ; well , that requires just a good solid foundation where you 're in balance and if somebody comes to push you , you 're , you know , you 're set .at that point , square up you 're shoulders to where you 're throwing , take a nice step , throw it .there are a lot of different ways that you can throw a football .the main thing that you need to focus on are two hands on the ball .so , if somebody comes up from behind you or in front of you , they do n't knock it out of your hand .so , do n't be swinging around like this .two hands on the ball.
and we 're just going to do rhythm with it .you want to do it at every other beat , 1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4-1.so , i 'm just doing it by moving my hands quick like this and the weight of all the beads moving around here.
we started off with sharpening the blade and doing an oil change and an air filter , spark plugs.
now , i 'm going to be showing you the snapshot at full speed .a couple of things to remember are , that when doing a snapshot , you do n't want to ever raise your stick , above your knees .also , this is probably the most common shot to take , when given a one time pass , if you do n't decide to one time it , so i 'm going to show you some spots at full speed , and that 's a snapshot a full speed .
alright .now , we 've just compounded our board .we 've got it all smooth and slick .really feels good to the hand , to the touch .and , this is the kind of finish that if you walk up to it.
now we 're moving on to eyeliner .this is one of the last steps in the eye department .for this look , you really do n't want to do eyeliner on top of the eye .you want to just do it inside the eye .you can do a black if you wanted it to be a little more dramatic , but we 're keeping pretty natural with her , so i 'm going to do a dark shimmery brown .it 's a mac liner .it 's called teddy .it 's a deeper bronze brown and it 's got a big of a glitter or glow to it , so.
i 'm here today to talk to you about bikram yoga , and specifically , the question , is bikram yoga good for flattening abdominals ?so any yoga is beneficial in weight loss , and contracting the abdominal muscles , if you do the style of yoga properly .bikram yoga , specifically , is a yoga that 's practiced in a hot room , so not only are you exercising the muscles , and creating a contract and release of the abdominal muscles , within each pose and within each breath , but you 're also met with a hot room , and essentially , sweating out your toxins , and sweating out lots of water weight too , so flattening your stomach is , it 's a little bit of a puzzle .you have to observe correct eating habits .you have to observe correct abdominal control , and contraction , through asana practice , and bikram yoga does help with increasing the detoxification benefits , through the external heat , that you 'll find , so is bikram yoga effective for flattening your stomachs ?i hope so .
this is a handy way to get in one single shot how many changes there are on any given guitar .if you are considering purchasing a guitar or buying someone 's used one , this is an important thing to know .how it is set up and how it functions .these could be changed .i could take all those rods out from underneath my guitar and make this completely different.
hi , i 'm emily larew and in this segment we 're going to look at triceps push ups .it 's really important as a hip hop dancer when you 're doing the pops and the waves to be able to isolate your arm muscles .and what better way of doing that my also warming up doing some push ups .one of my favorites to do in class is where you 're sitting down on the floor , making sure that your feet are apart , your fingers are actually going to face forward .so i 'm doing it towards you right now.
of course if you are going bus , automobile , cruise ship you do n't have to worry about it , but a carry-on is a carry-on in a plane.
here are some examples .sometimes people take just small balls of clay , and that 's what we start out with .i have some examples of some students here that perhaps just comes out to be a little pot like this , which is fine .this , by the way , has been bisque fired , and we 'll talk about that later .but with a little bit more clay , as you progress , your pots start getting bigger , perhaps into a bowl .and so it kind of morphs itself bigger shape with more clay , and.
for our mural , we 're going to be painting this whole wall .everything on here , this pale color is going to go away entirely .that means that we need to prepare our wall and floor just like we would a normal painting project .starting off with taping .get your good blue , electrical , painter 's tape , and start ripping off pieces of it .what we 're going to be doing here is we 're going to be covering up the trim .you can already see i 've done an awful lot of this , but we want to make sure there are no gaps and the like .areas where you could see where like paint could drip over and basically ruin our wood .now sometimes you may get a little bit of paint on the wood no matter how good your efforts are but painting , putting on the painting tape helps avoid a lot of that .to put this on , basically what you want to do is have the edge up as close to the gap as possible .now for tape placement , what we want to do is put the tape edge as close as we can to the gap .press down with your fingers to make sure you have a good grip .also , do n't leave the tape dangling off the edges .your thumb 's great at wrapping that around the corners .so next , we 're going to be removing all of our faceplates in the room .these include electrical outlets , light switches , cable phone jacks , because we do n't want to be painting over this as we 're doing our mural .now some people like to put more of our good old blue painters tape over the outlets as well to cover them up .i do n't like doing that.
corn should have a nice bright husk all the way around like this one does.
this is such a simple recipe , all you have to do is slash a baguette in half , top each half with about a fourth a cup of pasta sauce , sprinkle on a little grated cheese , pop it in the microwave oven , on high , just long enough to melt the cheese , and you 've got fresh hot pizza .of course , you can jazz up these pizzas by adding sliced pepperoni , canned mushrooms , and sliced black olives .be creative , use your imagination , and that 's how you make dorm room pizza .i 'm alexa sparkman until next time .
ok , now we 've already covered the lob serve .now we 're going to do what 's called the backhand serve .so i 'm going to be on the right side serving with a backhand .now this is very similar to a backhand volley but on this shot we 'll be angling it diagonal and try to get the ball to come up the side wall against our opponent .it 's a great serve , at the pro level a lot of players now are using this backhand serve vs.

calab labarda : all right .now , we 're going to be going over our front spins or up and down strikes .so remember , always hold your nunchucks one thumb-length from the top ,okay ?this is what it 's going to look like .you 're going to put it on your shoulders , spin down and strike .one , spin back up , two , okay ?from the side , one , two .from the other side , one , two , okay ?now , let 's go ahead and break it down .so from the top , you 're going to hold it in between your fingers .pinch , okay ?now , from here you 're going to spin one complete spin all the way over and down .one complete spin up , backwards , one , two , okay ?now , from the side , it 's going to look like this .go straight forward , one , spin over , two , spin back , one , two ,okay ?with one nunchuck , it 's like one , two .and you can switch up and do opposites , which is a good practice for your brain , training your brain to do two different things at once with your body .one , two , spin , one , okay ?so now , i 'm doing opposite spins .so from the front , at a pinch , complete one , two , one , two .switch from this side , one , two , one , two .and then you start going faster .remember , there are strikes .strike , strike , strike ,okay ?to the front .okay ?and then strike .bam .one , two .forward together from here .one , two , three , four , okay ?and those -- that 's going to be your up and down strike or your up and down spins .

now , what i want to talk about is my personal favorite move , is the half rollover into a spin move .now , basically when you do this your back is going to be towards the goal your attacking and your going to want to spin into the goal or into the direction of the goal .now , the way i do this is , i 'm rolling the ball .i do a roll and instead of completing the full roll i spin it around the other way and roll it back .so , its .and , your going the other way .so , its all about how you do with your hips .and , you turn .so , on a defender it looks like this .
now we 're going to go ahead and glue the different circles , the different layers on top of the original layer .it 's going to be a little bit different.

our subject today is the hp 45 cartridge .the hp 45 cartridge fits about 45 milliliters of ink .to fill it up first you will need to remove a black cover exposing this bb .once seen you can push the bb into the center of the cartridge and have no worry it will not damage anything in the printer .once you have pushed the bb into the cartridge you need to inflate the center bladder .to do so get a syringe without a needle , insert and push in about 10 milliliters of ink .some ink may come out of the top of the print head but do n't worry that is a good sign that the print head is clean .next after you have inflated the bladder get a syringe full of ink , put in about a quarter of an inch and slowly depress the ink filling the cartridge .once again it should take about 45 milliliters .the last part to refilling the hp 45 cartridge is to place a bb back in the top and depress firmly .after that is accomplished , place it on a paper towel for about 15 minutes .it will leak about 5 milliliters of ink causing a mess.
how to build big arms .first i would start with a stage called hypertrophy which is your very basic muscle building stage .for those who are beginners this is the stage you really want to be in .from maybe about ten to twelve reps , about three sets depending on your age , depending on your stature and what you are going to do is put together a combination of how to workout your arms .which i 'm going to do for you today .so we are going to work the biceps.
alright we 're going to go ahead and start with our puree .so we 're going to get a can opener , and we 're going to open our can of coconut milk .we 're going to measure out a half cup , we 're going to add this in stages because we 're using a small food processor .take our top off , we 're going to try to get a nice mixture of onions , potatoes and garlic .from here we 've put a little less than half , so we 're going to put a little less than half , the same amount of our coconut milk in , and then we 're going to , and then we 're going to transfer this mixture , right here into our bowl , and then we 're going to go ahead and repeat until everything is all mixed together .
sometimes it sticks to your pot , sometimes it does n't .so when you get clay on your tool , any tool for that matter , clean it off , set it aside .so you start with a nice clean tool , so that as you take your tool , touch your piece , remember this is still kind of sticky , your clay trimmings do n't transfer from your tool back onto your pot .you 're trying to get it off of your pot .so we 're going to come down in here again , clean some more of that off .see how you have that all down there ?you have to clean this off .sometimes you just get little pieces of clay .clean it off , you 've got a lot of time .so you have a nice smoothed out bottom down there .that 's it .
okay .now you can see that this is very rich and gooey cake .if your cake has sunk in like mine did , you can just take some of these ends and just fill the middle in a bit.
before you start using the loose powder makeup , you need to know what tools to use and the basics of how to use loose powder .loose powder can be tricky .it can be messy , and you really want to know what tools to use also before you start .with loose powders , like i said earlier , you can use them on any part of your body .eyes , lips , cheeks , and you can use them wet or dry , which is fantastic .you want to use something to mix them .some sort of little plate or petri dish.

the first example of a neck opening that we have is the basic button down front long sleeve cuff shirt opening with a collar .this you 're probably only going to use if you do like technically specific drawings .you can use this in some of your own ideas , but i find it rather boring .it 's just a plain old shirt .so the first thing that we do is right here that you notice that it goes around the neck .you want to make sure that you have some with that dimension so that you can tell that the collar is not just two flat squares of fabric coming through down the neck .so we want to make sure we show that and swoop it .it took me forever to learn how to draw .i do n't know why , but start at the next and swoop it down .and then go along the neck line to draw your collar .you all i should have made these points touch , but whatever .and then draw your button placket , and you 're done .

now that we 've done our continuation of our backwards columns or on the other side our upwards columns we 're going to continue to keep this pattern going on our row three .so , again you 're going to wrap your yarn around your needle .once you have this already established it just slides behind there so easily ; which of course makes it easy to continue the pattern .so , we have our three .pull it through the first two and pull it through the second two .you 'll see this is a continuant of .now , this may look a little high , but when we come in to fix our pattern to have it adjusted to go the opposite way you 'll really see that it does n't end up looking that big .now , we 're going to do it again .wrap your yarn around your needle .pull your yarn forward .we 've got our three loops .pull yarn through the first two .pull yarn through the second two ; one more time .go behind .pull it through .pull yarn through the first two loops .pull it through the second two .easy as pie .now , we 're just going to continue to keep the same pattern going until we get to the end .
rose cards are readily available .there are not a shortage of pete rose cards .if you go back into the sixties and his rookie card , you expect to pay for an average conditioned card three to four , five hundred dollars for a pete rose rookie .rose cards can be purchased for as little as twenty five cents a card and can be found at any of your hobby stores , any baseball card shows , online , and purchased from individuals .rose cards continue to sell reasonably well because he is very , very popular player .and i would recommend that you shop around for pete cards and also probably visit your local hobby shop or a national card show if one comes to your area .

hi.
in a case like this where there are just dead leaves and things in the surface , what you can do is just scrap it back and make sure that you  re creating a good wide ring around the fire of non-burnable soil and stuff that  s not going to catch on fire if a flame does jump out of the fire .you can pretty easily do that , the green stuff is not as likely to burn so that  s not as much of an issue .again , in a well used fire area in a place where you  re reusing an existing fire pit , this probably already been done and you probably already have a nice clear unburnable area around the fire .once you  ve cleared the area around the fire make sure you also store your firewood far enough from the fire , that that doesn  t catch and you  ll want to make sure that you keep that a good distance away from the fire .so again there  s not an opportunity for the fire to leap out of the campfire ring and catch your fuel wood on fire .
okay , let 's continue on with our realistic fire text .as we can see here , we 've got a lot of lines going on here so what i want to do is soften this out a little bit .let 's go to filter and let 's go to blur .i 'm going to go to blur.
so , here on out , we 've already finished up with our basil , redskin mashed potatoes --so , so good ; light , fluffy .added a little bit of fresh roasted garlic in there .next , we 're going on to our citrus-sage sauce , which is extremely good .i 've taken the liberty of adding shallots , garlic , white wine , reduce it down , drop some orange zest up in there and then finally , come back with our roasted shrimp shells that we 've had in the oven for , probably about like 15 or 20 minutes , just to kinda bring out that flavor .if you have shell-food allergies , stay away , stay away .so , we 're then going to lower our heat a little bit.
what your going to do pop it just like an ollie.
i want to talk about when it 's a good idea to play a draw .it 's five card draw poker , we can play draw sometimes .okay , here 's the thing .if you are drawing to a card that , if you 're only drawing to one card and you 're playing the high round .say you 've got a straight that can be completed by a middle card , that 's called a gut shot straight draw .the math is rarely going to be right to draw to that .you need to be getting , like , eleven to one return on your call .okay ?now , let 's talk about an open ended straight draw .open ended means you can catch a card at either end .so , look at this hand .queen , jack , ten , nine , and.
alright , so we 're going to finish off sherry 's eye with a little mascara .and what i 'm going to do with this is , i definitely want to give her a lot of volume , because she 's got some really beautiful eyes going on here .so , go ahead and look down , and i 'm going to take this mascara right from the base of her lash , and just totally pull it out .and i may even give her two coats , because i want to give her some really thick lashes .but like i said , i 'm going to start from the base of the lash , and i 'm sort of using a sawing motion back and forth .i 'm going to move my brush back and forth because that 's really going to grab the lash as i 'm moving to the outer edge of the lash .another thing i 'm going to do too is also go from inside as well , or you know , on the backside of the lash , and that 's going to grab it from back there as well .so , it 's totally going to coat the lash and make it jet black .and especially for a smoky eye , that is something really , really pretty .so , let 's start on the other eye here , get a little bit more color , i 'm going to dip my tube , or my wand back in to the tube .and go ahead and look down , and once again , i 'm going to start from the base and pull out , getting from behind the lash as well .and of course , when you 're doing your mascara at home , you do n't have to look down like this , but this is a great way to do it on someone else , because i do n't want to poke her in the eye .so , when i 'm ready to do the lashes on the bottom , i 'm actually not going to stick my wand back in to the tube.
o.k .so what we 're going to do here.
hi my name is madeline franco.
now , okay , remember in melodic minor scale , okay , you go up in the melodic formation with those fingerings , with everything i showed you .but , when you go down in the scale , okay .you play a natural minor scale .alright .so let 's try going down in the scale .let 's start on our fourth finger a natural .ready ?instead of a g sharp , it 's going to be g natural .instead of f sharp , it 's going to be f natural .instead of e natural , it 's going to be e flat .d.
in this clip i 'm going to be talking about if your model would like to incorporate a hand being casted into the belly cast .typically it is best if an adult does this ; meaning an adult hand being placed on the belly .children ca n't sit still that long ; to have their hands casted into mama 's belly .so , if you have your husband or significant other ; wants to stand behind you and put his hands on your belly , or if you want to put your hands on your belly that is perfectly fine .just try and steer away from kids .jewelry , if you 're wearing jewelry it 's best if you take the jewelry off .it wo n't really be seen when you cast over it and the plaster can get in the jewelry , so make sure you take that precaution .you want to make sure that you vaseline the whole area that will be casted .that may mean up to , you know , a quarter of your arm .the placement of the hand is important .if you 're casting half way down your belly the hand should be underneath the previous laid strip .you do n't want to place a hand over plaster that has already been laid and smoothed out .that will make it much more difficult to remove the cast .this has been how to prepare to incorporate hands into a belly casting .
this combination takes the mambo from the top .remember 2 little half semi circle turns with double knee.
this is your typical piece of baseboard right here .and basically what you would need to do.
now i 'm going to show you how to make a two-toned poncho .one layer of fabric with some pretty colored trims .what we 'll need for this project is two pieces of a coordinating fabric , measuring thirty-six inches by twenty-one inches .i 've chosen the dark purple and the light purple .then you 'd want some coordinating colors to , to do the trim .and i 've chosen four different coordinating colors in strips of one inch , by about a yard and a half .you 'll need some nice sharp scissors , some pins , and a ruler .to begin our two-toned fleece poncho , you want to take your two pieces of thirty-six inch by twenty-one inch fleece fabric and place them together with the wrong sides together .you want the wrong sides together on the inside.
i 've been doing construction for many years and i want to talk about soft woods .there are a few different soft woods used in construction and pine is one of the most common for exterior siding over the years in turns this beautiful gray and it used to be the fancy way to do new york city apartments in what they called barn board , basically gray pine .before it is gray it is brand new pine .over the years that will turn this way .pine is reasonably soft and not that strong for structural members .when you go with structural members as in 2x6 's there is spruce.
i 've been a carpenter for a long time and we 're going to talk about how to use a scroll saw .the first issue is how narrow a curve.
in this clip , we going to talk about a very important rhythm called kuku .kuku is a very popular with them .they play it almost all over africa , in all parties and to make people dance .so let 's start with the signal .the signal is what you do before you start playing the drum .the leader do the signal and everybody follows .so , the signal if i have to do it with my mouth goes .so let 's do it with the hand.
in most forms of solitaire there 's a point that you can come to mid hand , if you will , that you 'll realize ,oh , i 'm not going to win this hand .i might get a good score , i might get down close.

alright , let 's make a shot .what we 're going to do here is we 're going to attempt to pocket this ball in the corner pocket using all the techniques that we 've talked about thus far .so we 're going to go with our four step set up , where as we just step into it , get in alignment .now , what we have to start doing is as we get down.
we 'll now look at how to pack your gear for teleprompters .many teleprompter package systems come with shipping cases .generally , you will pay more for that perk , but they are usually nice because they are designed for that particular system .i 've always had my cases designed for my particular needs .i 'm now using bright yellow cases with lots of foam on the inside to protect my sensitive equipment .i can see the yellow cases a mile away at baggage claim .also i highly recommend getting a nice folding cart like this one .it 's adjustable for your various cases .if you do n't have a cart , you may be hand carrying heavy cases a long way .carts can also serve as a table .once you have emptied your cases and set up , you can use your cases as a table top for your laptop .also i 've found that you really should hand carry your laptops and there are a lot of types of soft and hard cases available .make sure you have your own power strip , stingers or extension cords , bnc and vga cables that attach to your computer and then to your monitors , lots of adapters , screws , black gaffer 's tape and dubatine cloth is always handy .also i 've found that a usb plug in light or a table light is very necessary for the job .
now i 'm going to show you how to replace your trombone slide bumper .first of all , there 's numerous reasons why they would go bad , from normal wear and tear .hit it on something and bend your bumper , which can definitely effect the integrity of the bumper material .this one as you can see is definitely torn , so we want to go ahead and take our little pliers and remove that off of there .then inspect it and make sure everything is okay , and we 've found ourselves a new bumper here which you can find at any repair shop .you might even be able to find that at the hardware store .but this is pretty self explanatory , just put the bumper down on the end there .and if you think that it might fall off , if it 's a little bit loose feel free to put a little bit of hot glue or something under there to keep it in place .but it 's very important that you have that on there.
choosing a diet or weight loss program can be overwhelming .there are so many claims out there , so many diets , so many fad diets.
in this example i 'm going to do another like , kind of heavy rock riff in a and some more reminiscent of the eighties type rock , but as i mentioned before there has been kind of a resurgence of the influence in today ?s rock and what i 'm going to do here is a riff in a and so with the drums it will sound like this .what i did there was.
it 's about 3 feet high , and it 's picked 4 times to 5 times most through out the year .and it starts in the early spring , about april or so , depending again on the weather pattern .and that specific tea is called sincha , very first picking of the year .and that style type of tea , only lasts about 7 to 10 days max .after that they have another picking , and that style tea is called sencha .most of the tea consumed in japan is called sencha .and they also export it to over seas , is the style of sencha .because the japanese drink so much green tea , that they have to import from china a sencha tea .so what they do is they ask their chinese counterpart to produce a tea that 's made the way they do .and what the japanese do , is after they pick their tea leaves , they steam the tea leaves , increasing the corafil .therefore , when you look at a japanese green tea , it is greener than chinese green tea .from the sencha the leader picking is called bancha , and what they do is they take the bancha.
so you have to make adjustments there .this is another little trick that i got for you that is going to save you money and hassle about looking for parts .what you are going to do is you are going to cut off the last inch of your tube .so we will do that very quickly .wow that was fast .now we have got our end tube-a-ring and the rest of our tube and what we are going to use this for is our lenses by putting our transparencies on each side of it and creating our end cap .i will show you how to do that next .
one of the jump ropes i 'm going to be talking about today is the general plastic , we call them plastic type nylon jump rope .most of them are equipped with a ball bearing type swivel at the very end so that makes them a little bit faster and the jump rope itself does n't get balled up inside the handle .these are also adjustable if you decide that a nine foot one is too long for your average boxer , most of your boxers .you can actually shorten it by passing the jump rope back through it , through the handle itself and there 's usually a net or a wire coupling on there that you can actually cut and then reattach.
there are three vegetables in our recipe for the acorn tagine .there is acorn squash , red pepper , and red onion .when you are choosing the vegetables , look for things that are unblemished .when you bring them home , make sure you take the labels off and wash off any excess dirt or sand .the other thing you will need is a good cutting board , and a nice chef 's knife , along with a paring knife and a spoon to clean out the squash .
when you 're going to install a full system on a bike like this , the first thing you need to do after you take all the plastics off is you have to loosen the radiator support and push the radiator forward , which will allow to get into the header bolts , and once you get the header bolts off , you 'll eliminate the header pipe , the butterfly valve , the collector right here , and the rear muffler .so , once we get all that off , we 'll get everything cleaned up , we 'll head and get the oil changed , and then , we 'll put the brand new pipe back on .right now , i 'm removing the header bolts , the bolts that hold the header on , and once i get those off , this thing will come right off .all right , now that we got the header bolts all taken out , we 're going to go ahead and drop these few bolts , take the butterfly valve , and the exhaust should just come right off .you 're just going to release these cables right here .here 's the butterfly valve .there we go .and basically , this is the whole factory exhaust .until you remove , just take all the bolts out , slide it right out , and we 'll change the oil really quickly , and we 'll get the new one locked up and ready .
okay , so in this tutorial we 're going to move on.
in this clip we 're going to talk about miter cuts .let 's take a look at the circular saw , again making sure it 's unplugged for safety .with this adjustment , we can change the angle of the base plate , in this case we 're going to , it usually has a stop at , there you go ,forty-five degrees .this way if you , if you make two forty-five degree cuts , you can make a nice corner on say , a hand rail or something on your deck .so let ?s go ahead and clamp up a piece of wood and take a shot at it .again , be mindful of binding .if you feel the saw starting to bind , stop .plug it back in and.
so put the head inside of the water , take the bubbles out and then get the head out and take the air .so bubbles in the water and take in air .
all right .well , now we 're ready to get started .we 've talked about the structure of the song , we talked about the general feel of the song , we 're going to write more of a texas country song .`` texas '' is more specifically a love ballad country song , it has a texas twist , and we are in our zone , we have our texas flag , we have our cowboy hat.
okay now i 'm going to demonstrate how to prepare your bat for the clay to go on to it .we want to put the bat on to the wheel with these little pins here .and these pins are on the wheel and they go through those wing nuts on the bottom .we just want to secure the bat on to our wheel , like so .now you can see we 've had these lumps of clay sitting here slightly damp on this bat , however often times we 'll have a bat which fresh off the rack.
okay , now to continue where we were :when you toss the ball , now i 'm on the deuce side .so , let 's say i want to hit a serve out wide to my opponent 's forehand.
now i 'm going to dial this barrel adjuster in all the way because when you put on new housing your cables do stretch out and bed in , so it 's good to be able to take up that slack .feeding through , i 've hit a little bit of a snag right here , so , there we go .through smooth , clean , and clear .put that farrell back on the end there .so , the first one is seated , now i need to find the second piece of housing .this bike has three individual runs of housing .one from the handle bar to right there , one from right here to right here to compensate for the movement of the suspension , and then one piece down there .the downhill bike over there has a continuous housing loop all the way from the derailer up to the handle bars .and that is because of just the mucky conditions that you can be forced to ride in and stuff like that .it makes you have to change cables due to contamination less frequently , which is a mechanic 's dream .but you know housings a lot heavier than just a cable .so , on xc bikes like this , we try to avoid doing that to save weight .although some folks who ride in really adverse conditions tend to run full cables of housing on everything just by zip tying full pieces to the frame .so you can see there 's a little indentation on the derailer.
here 's some ways you can do to prevent that ; make sure you keep tabs on exactly whose coming to your party .also keep general track whether or not they think they can invite friends , maybe be explicit maybe they can bring one friend or two no more than that .and those friends can not bring anybody else especially if you have a smaller house or smaller place , where you 're holding the party you do n't want to be jammed totally wadded up in there with about 80 people .that 's not a fun time for you , the other thing to keep in mind is party crashers , these can be people that were not originally invited but decide to crash the party .so you want to make sure and try to hold these people off especially if they have been drinking or doing who knows what you do n't want those folks at your party .it ruins your party and it 's not a fun time.
okay , what would you check these chemicals with ?and what we 're going to do is we 're going to check the ph balance and by the way.
so you just get home from ice fishing ; your cold , you  re hungry ; all you want to do is change your clothes , sit down on the couch.
in soccer , sometimes it 's needed for you to be able to use many different parts of your foot .by doing a rainbow kick , you have to use both the inside of one foot , and the heel of your other .a rainbow kick in soccer would be used ,let 's say if you were trapped in a corner and could n't get out , by dribbling , passing , for finding some other means of getting through your defenders .by using the rainbow , you 'll be able to flick the ball over your head and maybe even possibly over the defender -- over the head of a defender .when doing a rainbow kick , the ball stays in between your legs , comes -- you pull it up with one foot , and then you flick it with your heel over your head .i 'll demonstrate by just showing you how it would be done .you pull the ball up with your left foot , if you 're going to flick it with your right .so you pull the ball up , and flick it with the heel on your right foot over your head .and that 's just how you 'd do a rainbow kick .
so the first move is the glide based on the heel toe turn in , turn out as i showed you a lesson before .so we start turn out right leg on the heel , left leg on the toe.
supplies that you 'll want to use to create a really pretty sun-kissed look are a foundation primer this just helps in overall wear ability in application of your foundation .we 're going to use an oil-free liquid foundation .we are going to use some bronzer .a really nice peachy tone of blush and we 're going to set that all off with some shimmer powder .we are going to use , of course , an eye shadow primer to help the eyeshadow stay on a lot better .we 're going to use a nice gold and a soft taupe eyeshadow .we 're going to use some black cream liner .some black mascara and we will use some under eye brightener with concealer .and for our lip look , we 're actually going to mix two shades of lipstick , we 're going to mix a really pale , nude tone with a little bit of a peachy tone to give us a really nice peachy bronzy kind of look .so those are some of the supplies that you 'll want to use to create a really great sun-kissed beach babe look .
alright , another shot you can use in your repertoire.
now that you have been able to gain an advantage to the outside of the body , she throws her punch , i block , move to the outside , now i 've to look at targets .now , as far as throwing punches , very first target is straight on to the arm and when you strike you want to strike roughly an inch above the elbow because that is the place where the arm will most likely break .also , you can strike into the tricep or you can strike underneath the arm.
okay , we 've spent the last three segments talking about ways in which you can move cards in accordion .and , there 's actually four ways .so , here 's the fourth .its three stacks over by suit .so how does that work ?well , here 's a diamond ,that is 1-2-3 stacks from another diamond .so we can play that there .we can play this seven of diamonds on top of this ten .i can then play diamonds on diamonds , here , but we 're not talking about that type of move .where else , let 's see .well , if we look over at these hearts , i can more this ten , 1-2-3 , on top of that queen of hearts .and then this eight of hearts , 1-2-3 , on top of the ten of hearts .where else can i move cards three over by suit ?here 's a five of clubs and it is 1-2-3 from the king of clubs .and , here 's the ace of diamonds , 1-2-3 from the jack of diamonds .you see how we quickly go from 52 cards or stacks down to a couple dozen .it 's not hard to play this game , although it does take up a bit of space .
alright i am basically going to mirror the major exercises here in the minor key just so you can hear what it sounds like.
and i am a software developer .in this video i 'll show you how to add a link to a picture .i am using frontpage .frontpage is a registered trademark of microsoft , a company to which i have no affiliation .if you want to add an image gallery on your web site , you should create small preview images called thumbnails .these images are usually between seventy-five to two hundred pixels in width and height .they serve as links to the pictures in their entire resolution .a good practice is to create images folder in the same directory where you store the web page .inside the images folder i have the thumbnails and the original pictures .to insert a thumbnail as a link , select insert , picture and thumb file .browse through the images folder and select the thumbnail .click on the picture .press again on the insert tab.
the dragon stretch is , can be , can be as challenging as you want it to be .but , the more effort you put into the various stretches , the more benefit you 'll feel when you are doing your martial arts training .
hi .i 'm travis corpering and.
so from wide leg forward bend , come up , and prepare for warrior 2.and lift the spine horizontal , hold the horizontal , as long as you want , as long as you can , at least a couple of moments , and then press down with the feet , come all the way up .this transition , keep your hands on your hips , and when you get to the top , really pull up , pull up on the fronts of the hips , not by squeezing the backsides , but just toning , right here in the abdomen , between the hip bones and ribs .so for warrior 2 , first things first ; have each heel in line with each sitting bone , in other words , do n't have one forward and one back .then whichever leg you 're going to turn , ( in this case i 'm turning the right leg )turn on the heel please , and leave it there .so if my heel is still in line with my sitting bone , my other heel is still in line with my sitting bone ; you do it any other way , the alignment is going to be thrown off , okay .so we started from this upright position , and we were neutral.
now i 'm going to teach you the difficult part movement for the burmese rama solo .when you drag back i will slow you very show you very slowly .one , two , three , go .one , two , three , go .one , two , three , go .now to continue with the hands slow movement .when you say , one , two , three , go , one , two , three , go .one , two , three , go and up .now to have the first one when you see .it 's moving very fast.
okay , now once you have that all put together and all your seams checked we are ready to cut our batting out .you go ahead and lay your batting down first , and then lay your blanket on top .and you want to cut around it and allow some room for extra .batting 's not highly expensive so it does n't hurt to have extra .and for my family quilt , i 'm actually using one of our old blankets that we had bought years ago that i really liked the weight of it.
now i am going to show you the veil work with the headlock and arms in egyptian style .you are always going to get started with your veil on the bottom or to the side , but this time we are going to start with the veil on the bottom .also , if you work with a veil like this that does the half circle i always recommend you to use this beautiful pattern because when you start your veil work on the floor like this , it looks like it is a part of your outfit .you can have this position and you can perform your headlock .and this half is the egyptian style and the egyptians worked a lot with their eyes.
i think it is important in which brand.
in this we 're going to talk a little bit about some of the angles that you 're going to be cutting with your , with your circular saw .again , when we 're making adjustments we 're unplugged .we just did.
hi , this is jon and in this clip we will be installing our door sweep .if we take a look at the very bottom of our door , we have a fairly significant gap where wind and air , or even bugs could get in .to remedy this , our door has come with a sweep and a rubber gasket for that sweep so that we can form a nice , tight seal on the bottom ; so no air or bugs or anything can get in .the first thing we need to do is feed our rubber gasket into the channel on our door sweep and we 're just going to fit it all the way down .then we 're just going to trim off the extra .after that , we 're just going to take our door sweep and our door.
what makes a `` q '' a `` q '' , the tail .the `` r '' starts out with a minim stroke now just like with the `` b '' and the `` d '' going to start up here .think tall and thin come down like that , see how i made this a little thinner through here .it looks more elegant , not as clunky .now the `` s '' as long spine on the `` s '' like so , think about this as being a narrow letter.
one of the best ways to learn how to do any trick on a quarter pipe or a mini-ramp , is first to find a spot that does n't have any coping on it .the coping sometimes can be the hardest thing to get away from , or to get over when you 're coming out of certain tricks .and especially for the fakie ollie disaster , this is especially true .because as you 're coming back in , sometimes your feet wo n't be ready and you 'll hit the coping , or where the coping would be here , and lock up and fall in .so , it 'll be good if you can find a quarter pipe like this concrete one that i 'm on right now , where you can come up and hit it and actually get to leave it just a tiny bit and get the motion down , and then be able to roll in , no problem and not have any coping to worry about .what 's different on this spot is that i wo n't have to put my front foot on the front nose and specifically pick up to clear coping .what you 'll be able to do , is come up fakie , pop the trick , land , and in any foot position that you 're in , you 'll be able to roll back in , since there 's no coping .so , if you can find a spot to learn your tricks on like this one , it 'll definitely help in the learning process .and this is just one way that it 'll help to learn to do fakie ollie disasters .
remember your jump rope is optional .now that we 've finished doing those push ups , we 're feeling nice and strong , it 's time to get that imaginary jump rope out or your real one .this time we 're going to focus on jumping forward and back .this works totally different muscles , you 'll feel it .to demonstrate , i 'll show you how forward and back with the jump rope would go .your feet would go something like this .you want to stay on your toes , and you want to use your imaginary jump rope as you 're doing it .especially if you do n't have good coordination , just use your imaginary jump rope .you can do all kinds of things with it .you can even double jump doing it .but keep going and breathe .you want to just keep going for three minutes , and at the end of that , we 're back to doing more strength .
so now that you 've got your clay centered , you 're ready to start the form .you want to take your left index finger and push down .then take your right hand , just it 's there to stabilize and squeeze the sponge if you need water .and then you 're going to pull your left index finger towards your right hand .compress the floor .but before you call that done , you want to take your needle tool clean it off .put it right through the center and it 'll leave a smudge that 'll tell you how deep that floor is .you want it to be about a quarter of an inch .and once you 've got that , the depth that you want it to be , you can take your hard rib , i like to use a hard , metal rib , and compress the floor .that makes it smooth .it also makes it stronger by the compression .and now we 've got this pieced opened , and we 're ready to start pulling the walls .
spain happens to be one of the cheapest countries to visit in europe , but you still want to save a little money by making your long distance calls on weekends and nights .determine what time it is in the united states .spain is one hour ahead of greenwich.
okay , so now we have our curling ribbon through our flower and we 're going to place that towards the bottom of the party boa or the boa .it 's not the party boa yet .it 's getting there .i 'm going to place it at the bottom , approximately -- say an inch or so .and this time , when i pull the ribbon around , i 'm going to tie the ribbon right in the front of the flower and through the --i think they call that the stamen or something , that 's the center of the flower --and that 's where we 're going to be knotting it .now remember , our first ribbon was towards the back and this one 's going to be towards the front .and i 'm actually going to just do a knot .and if you noticed , it goes right around the whole center of the flower there .and we just make a knot .and now , it depends on how long you want to have your ribbon .i think i 'm going to make this ribbon a little bit shorter and just coordinate the difference.
i like to use slighter lighter than the foundation around your eyes .remember we want lightness around your eyes .with women of color , because of melanin , sometimes causes darker circles around the eye .so , it 's important to use concealer .you could use concealer with your hands , you could use concealers with a sponge , or with your foundation brush .remember if you are using it with your hands you want to use your weakest finger , which is your ring finger .i personally like to use a brush .so , i 'm gon na go ahead and put on a lighter concealer than the foundation around shevon 's eyes .i start from the outside corner and i work my way in .remember you do n't want to pull.

this is mark bowers , from bowersphotography.com .i 'm in american fork , utah , and this segment.
so here 's some common mistakes that you might make while you 're working a ribbing .i 've started a knit 2 , purl 2 rib .so one way , is if you 're knitting , and you do n't bring your yarn in front , but you do your purl , so you 'd go to do your purl , and you 'd wrap your yarn , and your yarn would come around the needle , and you 'd have an extra loop on it .another thing would be , is if you were knitting your ribbing , and you forgot , and then you have knit 3 , but then you threw yourself off , and you have knit 2 , and you threw your whole ribbing off , this is where you would need to unknit back to where you made your era .so you 'd turn your work around , and you would unknit those stitches to get back to.
now we 're going to hit the other side of the forearm , the bottom part , right here .generally , with this , you 're just going to do different forms of wrist curls .i 'm just going to start with a barbell wrist curl .i 'm just going to grab a barbell , preferably , wrist hanging off the end of the bench here ,elbows on the bench , as well .going to curl right down to your fingertips and then curl right back up and then twist the wrist in and get that nice contraction .i 'll show you a few reps right here .down to the fingertips , squeeze right in .do n't forget to curl those wrists in at the end of the movement .you do n't want to just come up and stop here , you want to squeeze right in .you could even switch it up , if you want by using a dumbbell .i 'll show you real quick .grab a dumbbell , one of them will do because you can only do one at a time .again , same idea , wrists are hanging off the bench , elbow on the bench , curling right down to the fingertips , coming right back up , squeezing the wrist in , contracting the forearm .i like to use dumbbell just because you can really focus on each forearm and just really get that mass in there.
we 've got our , our sleeve now that we want to take in .this is too big , i 'm not into that at all .so , i want to take it in probably to about here , i 'm going to slide a pin in , as best i can with my one hand .so , my sleeve is going to be like that .that might still be a little big , i 'm going to add , i 'm going to take it in more .there we go .and , i 'm also going to raise.
now it 's time to talk about what happens after the draw .after the draw comes another betting round .the player to the dealer 's left can check or bet .he says check .the action goes around to you .you , remember , had that pat seven low , at this time you 're going to bet .the reason is you want to get paid before your seven low .now before the draw you bet two black chips .so you want to make sure you bet a little more .you 're going to say four black chips .player to your left can fold , call or raise .he calls .i 'm going to call and put out four black chips .this player calls and puts out four black chips .what happens now ?what does everybody have ?well we 're saving that for the next segment .but i can tell you with your seven low pat hand you 're in good shape .
one of the newer plants that really has taken off is the lepto we call it and the lepto has these beautiful little pink blossoms that tend to be covered about ten months of the year .leptospermum.
alright lets start on the eyeballs now , get them to close there eyes and what your going to do.
but , proportion is very important .i generally teach my students that you should not have a large piece of paper with a little bitty still life right in the middle of it .everything should fit the paper .you may have the object go off of the page at one place or another , but they all should be in proportion in relation to each other .that means the number of portions , the size of the portions , and remember , you do not want everything the same size .and , when you get to number of things on the page , remember , it 's three , six , nine , or twelve .stay tuned for the next segment which is on rhythm .
obviously a paddle is extremely important while kayaking.
now we are going to add some extra hip movements to our egyptian walk .so let 's just start with our basic egyptian walk .weights on the right foot .left foots up on show girl foot .make sure the angles not falling out .good !make sure the knees bend .belly buttons pulled in .chest lifted .shoulder 's back and down .good !this hips going to come straight up into our rib cage .and as we drop it , we are going to accent the drop .drop !and then as we step over to the other side , we are going to accent that step with the hip lift on this side .so now this hip is free .lift , drop , switch .lift , drop , and switch .lift and then drop .so as you 're going your adding extra hip movements .good !but you do n't want to lose your initial up and down movement .so think of everything as an up and then down and the switch .good !also make sure that your level is not changing .it  s very easy to go up on the up .and down on the down and then switch .but we do n't want this type of movement .right !so you want nice level .practice in the mirror .then we 'll have that up down and then switch , without doing a level change .
but you do it every time .every quarterback is going to throw it .this is the wrist snap drill .what we do is we have our hand up and all we do is emphasize turn , turn .this is the top motion of every throw .do n't have your hand here , have it high and go to the top half of your motion .you do this for about 5 minutes .you will be fatigued but just imagine i 'm throwing a ball 60 times a game .make sure you have that wrist snap .want that wrist snap , throwing motion .
here we have an example , two examples of two different types that intersect .there are many creatures in the game which are both artifacts and creatures .this represents the idea of robots and other war machines and siege engines .this is the extruder , and this is a goblin war wagon .they both say artifact creature on their type , and they both have power and toughness in the lower right hand corner .that means that these cards can be affected either by things that affect artifacts , destroy target artifact or enchantment such as disenchant .or something that says target creature gets minus three minus three until end of turn .either icker slick or disenchant could kill either of these cards because they 're both artifacts for disenchant , and they both have three toughness for icker slick .these cards have advantages in that they 're colorless and can be played in any deck for the cost of four manna each in any color .but they also have disadvantages of being susceptible to a wider range of cards .
our warm up is going to be focusing on your ankles .the first one that we 're going to do is what 's called the ankles-circles .so you 're going to bring your feet close together.
we 're going to start with one ball .what you do , is you 're actually going to do a scooping motion , and you always catch the ball on the outside , you scoop down and throw on the inside , and you 're going to catch it on the outside , scoop in .so you scoop down.
we 're going to do a bit of a paddle and roll combination .and this one 's a little different .it adds some kind of like triple heel slaps and then into like a nice little syncopated finish .so let 's start part one of the paddle combination .watch my feet .ok let 's start the paddle combination on the left foot.
, that 's how we count it .you 've got the kick drum coming in on the e of two .okay , so you have 2 , snare and high hat , e , two-e-and-a , and then you have your upbeat on a high hat.
how to define upper arms .well for me it goes from the elbow up to the delt and so while biceps and triceps are all part of that.
or i break that window that alarm is going to start wailing .that  s a really good deterrent and like.
and i would show you what supplies are needed .
corners usually get missed .grab this top edge and clean it .but you do n't want to take your rag no matter how clean your rag is , how dry it is , i do n't like to ever take my towel and rub out a spot with my towel , just because if you 're in the bright sunlight and the sun is shining on that window everywhere that you put your towel.
now the carrick bend with ends adjacent is actually an old knot , it is actually a family knot belonging to harfod the wake and his family .knots we will find out usually have family ranks that denote royalty , hierarchy and what not , especially when we get into the saxon and keltic races or religions , however you want to look at them .they are very special knots to these people , they spend a lot time actually coming up with `` family knots '' as you can tell with keltic knots , keltic designs and what not like that .what we are going to look at right now is these two ropes i have got coming in here together , i am going to actually remove one of these for the moment .i am just going to go ahead and take this , i am going to put a bend in it , like so , now i am going to take my other rope.

and it 's not going to take a whole lot of weight because you 're going to have to control a lot of momentum .so coming in at walker ped position on all fours .hands underneath the shoulders .knees hip width apart.
okay , blended teas .what is a blended tea ?well it 's just like it sounds .its two kinds of tea blended together .now , you won ?t really see a blend of tea very often that is like a green tea blended with a black tea .or a white tea blended with an oolong .you might see that from time to time but generally we 're talking about blending teas of the same basic category like black teas or green teas with one another .okay ,so as i said before .you have teas that are grown in different parts of the world and they have different characteristics .one tea might have a lot of caffeine and the other tea might have a really smooth flavor .so maybe you 'll mix a darjeeling black tea with an assam black tea to create a black tea blend .and some famous blends that you may have heard of are like english breakfast tea , is a blend of several kinds of black teas .and irish breakfast tea as well as indian breakfast are all different blends of black teas .and so with all these different teas i encourage you to go out and buy them and try them so that you can find out what blends or what plain old single type teas.
it is a regular back pack .when you have twins you find that you do n't have the shoulder space for a over the single shoulder diaper bag .so it works good just to have it on your back .anyways one good thing that you need the most.
and we are going to set the saw to where we think 90 degrees should be .go ahead and tighten it .next we are going to turn our saw upside down.
this is blues with voice leading example four .basically the conclusion .the whole thing .so let 's go over it .now this is just an example of voice leading .i recommend you try this with blues in every key , as well as all the standards you know .
and today we are here to talk about what to look for in choosing a treadmill .first thing you want to make sure that the treadmill itself is going to meet classification or specifications of the user .namely weight and height , those are paramount in what you decide and choose in a treadmill .as soon as we cover that then we need to decide what are our goals as far as what we expect to get out of our treadmill .are we just going to be walking , maybe some light jogging on the treadmill or are we going to be doing some more labor intensive activities like running .and some interval exercises on a treadmill , those can also effect what we are , what we should look for in a treadmill .number three in the world of treadmills the old adage you pay for what you get and does , apply however .so typically the more expensive the treadmill the higher the quality that you are going to receive and also look for a name brands that are recognizable and ones that have a reputation in the industry as being reliable over time .and lastly a good warranty on a treadmill is a very good indicator of number one , how supportive the company is behind their product that it puts out and number two.
today we 're going to talk about how to remove natural way hair from face , facial hair .the best way i like is threading and natural way .it 's the old ancient people use to use this technique .i just tie the thread on my neck and then twist the thread like four , five or six times , like this .and like this we 're going to remove the hair , facial hair naturally .this is perfect way to remove hair .i know you 're going to be a little bit in pain , but that 's okay .and this is the way , natural , to remove the hair .and also sometimes the thread get tear off , and i 'm going to replace thread again , and i tie it to my thread on my neck area.
now we look at the last two options .this is by far and away the most difficult of the game , certainly more difficult than tricks or nullos or queens or what have you .if you look at this hand closely , we can certainly say for example that we would never call queens with a hand like this because we are going to take a lot of queens .the reason that this hand is ideal is that it has the tops and the bottoms and the escape cards which are the deuces .okay , that means that there will be a point in this hand when you can shed this hand absolutely positively by trick number eleven .and here is the plan , here is how you would play last two with this hand .again , why would you call last two ?because you have the tops and the deuces .not the threes , per say , the deuces .the deuces enable you to escape the hand .you have to make the effort to count the suites , that is the whole thing you have to make sure your deuce is not an established card .you start with the king of clubs and you just keep plowing that suite through until you get that ace out , okay .they will play the ace , nobody is going to hold on to the ace .they may hold on to it a couple of times but sooner or later you are going to rip through to the ace .then if you get thrown back in with , let us a say , a spade.
now that we have our grid pattern laid out with henna , what we 're going to do is we 're going to do a holly design directly on the henna over that , kind of making the leaves come up the fingers and stretch across the hand .we 'll have a couple of leaves going this way and a few going down this way .later we 'll connect them with some berries .there we go .we have the holly on there .then we 'll fill in some of the leaves , making the outline a little bit thicker .
your initial shooter will receive five dice and he can choose two of the five .this is the puck .the puck is a courtesy for the guest to help remember what they 're shooting for .in this particular case he would be shooting for a six .the puck is turned off when either the six or the point , the shooter is shooting for is made or they crap out .an example of a general bankroll .bankrolls are made up of either valued checks , usable pretty much anywhere in the casino or possibly non-valued checks .
we start with the sur place 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 , basic movement forward , basic movement backward , sur place once again , and back , sur place , 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 , basic movement forward , basic movement backwards , and sur place once more , attack 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 , and sur place 2 ,3 ,4 , and then chasse to the right .it 's 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 , chasse to the left 3 ,4 and from here we can do the traveling spin 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,1 ,2 ,3 ,4.finishing in a promenade position.
m going to take you through a handstand forward roll .this is very essential to teach your athletics how to keep a nice tight body .a lot of people have a hard time with this exercise , it looks very simple but if you lose at all you are not going to be able to get back to your feet .i ?m going to combine a handstand and the forward roll together .once i reach the handstand position.
so for exercise number eight here , we 're going to be hitting the abdominals .now this is a tough one to hit .you see a lot of people just doing crunches with bad form , probably not really hitting the abs too well .so i 'll show you a good way to hit them .now i like to just do regular crunches on a ball here .you should have a ball at your gym .and now what you want to make sure you 're doing is just keeping the lower back on the ball.
and i 'm.
a great way to open up your hips and come into the rhythm of your breath is with sufi circles .you can do this alone.
run , run , run .let 's look at the next page .that was said what the words are .jump , child does n't know the next word .so what can you do when you come to a word you do n't know ?it 's important that you have the strategies to teach your child .you tell them to look at the pictures for clues .if we go back to seeing spot run or jump .for example we 're back at the page ; what is the doggy doing ?what is the doggy doing ?he 's jumping .look at the pictures for clues and then go back into the text ; jump , try sounding it out .blend your sounds .let 's try it together .spot , here 's jump spot .so look at pictures for clues .another strategy ; skip unknown words .even in high school when you 're taking tests , a lot of times teachers will tell you , if it does n't come to you immediately go back to that question .same thing with reading.
so with the feet angled correctly and the forward knee directly over the ankle and the kneecap over the second toe , bring your hands to prayer position at the heart , relaxing the shoulders back and just noticing , if you 're feeling any torque or tension in that forward knee or the rear knee or the ankles and you can actually come in and out of it a bit , bending the knee back and forth a few times to see if there 's anything that 's too tense , too tight , that does n't feel right .there 's a difference between stretch and pain.
and i am going to demonstrate how we do a woodchopper .it is just like it sounds , you are going from your hand straight across to your ankle .so just think about chopping your ankle with your hand .the benefits are in the obliques , so we are working the internal and external obliques .you are going to feel that stress all the way across those abs .it is a great exercise .to modify this , you are going to bend your knee on the outside leg .the inside leg we are going to point the foot.
time to work on our smoked salmon canapes .now , i 've seen these canapes done where they were on very crispy rye bread that had clearly gone into the oven to become almost cracker-like , and it was so awkward to eat , because you bit into it and sort of half the salmon slid off and half of -- anyways , it was a mess .so i 've decided that what i really like is what they call european bread at my grocery store , and it 's this grainy texture , and it 's sort of , strong enough of a bread that it can hold the salmon.
when you are looking at pink luster another shape that i wanted to talk about because a lot of people like to just collect cups and saucers .in here we have some cups and saucers which during that period they called these tea bowls also.
so , now that we 've created the base for our lizard we 're going to give it some shape .shape in the head and shape in the body .remember that this is a sculpture.
it 's a crucial step in the process .it will save you a lot of time and energy so that you know the property you are looking at is property that you are qualified to buy and not looking at things that wo n't work for you , whether they 're too small and do n't , and you 're qualified to buy more than them or if they 're too expensive.
hi now you 're going to learn what you will need to take an awesome belly dance class .well first of all you need to feel comfortable .i recommend this kind of pants , that is cotton cause it makes your body breathe more , and also this is the classic coin belt to make a mean shimmy , and in belly dance.
immediate means immediate in the sense of getting your money in an income stream .once you have a lump sum of money and you want to keep it for the future , but you only want to receive a payment that is for your budget , in other words , you turn it into an immediate annuity .an insurance company is a company that does this .for example , if you take a hundred thousand dollars based on your age , you want to receive an income stream for ten years , twenty years , or for your entire life , that 's what the insurance company will do .they 'll keep the balance of the money back growing at an interest rate , while you take a payment for your budget going forward , therefore making your money last a lot longer .if you had the money in your own care and attention during that period of time you might run the risk of well , blowing the money or spending it on something that you end up with very little principle .this is a safe way to put the money in the hands of a financial custodian for your financial future .keep in mind that while the annuity money is with the insurance company , the only time you pay taxes on , is when you take your payment out at the ordinary rate of income tax .it 's a better way to make your money last longer , using immediate annuities .i 'm financial planner patrick munro .
once you 've got your tent laid out , you need to gather all the poles that come with the tent and lay them out.

so we have several types of travel toys .if you 're in the car , this is a wonder wheel .this hooks up to the back seat and the child has this interactive steering wheel in which they can play lights and music .it 's basically a remote control and it makes the pictures and activities light up on the play mat .this is for 12 to 36 months when the baby is in a forward facing car seat .for an older child that likes to draw and do creativity and art , we have this splash art .there 's two sided.
whether you are blocking , whether you are throwing , whether you are running .it does n't matter what you 've got to have good balance .so what we 're going to do right now.
and i 'd like to share a few tips with you .for example , when it 's really tired , hard decision to make , you might want to sleep on it .just like grandma used to say , `` when you wake up in the morning , you usually have a clear perspective on what 's going on '' .when we 're over tired , we can never make the right decision and everything seems overwhelming .so it 's best to be rested when you make this decision .the other thing you can do is distance yourself from the problem .you may need to either go out for a few hours , go take a ride , go kind of chill out and talk to friends .or , if it 's a really big problem that calls for a lot of deep internalization and thought , you may want to actually take a weekend away .alone.
so now as we can see here that i have cleaned this photo up just a little bit and we are going to move on a bit more resizing and tweaking here .so as we can see , we have got natalie 's face , it is pretty cleaned up here.
for instance if you were doing this for a bed and breakfast , some people are allergic to the starch.
it needs to get some nutrients.
we can also create texture with a variety of finishes that they use in the faux finish painting to create textures and there 's no reason why you ca n't use it in your artwork .a lot of these involve putting on the paint and then taking it off.
so , as we begin today , i 've chosen just a piece of cardboard , thin cardboard to use as my backing .so , we 'll be adhering things just onto this and that will be the platform for the collage .so , i think today ,i 'm just going to go for a sort of travel/map theme because i have a lot of maps and stuff to use .and again , there are no rules with this .whatever you have to use , you can , or you can search out whatever kind of crazy ideas you have .i 'm just going to go through this , and flip through , and see what catches my eye .whatever catches your eye and whatever you think might look good .here 's a nice little pull-out map , actually .i think i might use this to begin .and again , you do n't have to have everything pre-selected .you can kind of go as you like .you can pre-select things , if you want and have it layed out before you adhere it to that .i 'm using scissors here.
now we are going to spray color with short strokes hand .and okay now we have to let it dry a couple of hours.

so , katate-tori sumiotosh .very simple .think about holding a sword , cutting .hand at the elbow , just like you 're pushing a shopping cart , we do n't push with our arms , we push with our bodies .definitely like you 're pushing a car , same thing .you can also go to the inside .just tenkan the inside , and continue moving .tenkan , slide board .okay ?
ok.
since cocktail parties tend to start rather pretty much early in the evenings and go no later than 9:00.you basically will have someone in a dress such as this where it 's not a long formal length , but cocktail parties , they usually start , the dresses start around the knee and that 's pretty much standard ; and because they go into early evening , sometimes you would have a shrug or pullover or little valero jacket that would accompany it because it could get a little chilly sometimes .but the basic concept of the cocktail dress is that you want something that 's easy , attractive , and that you can basically drink in .this is the important thing about a cocktail party dress .when you see a cocktail dress , two things you may notice is that sometimes they come in two pieces .it 's always something to have to cover yourself up in the afternoon because usually it gets a little later and a little cooler because cocktail parties tend to go from 5:00 o'clock up until no later than 9:00 , and as cotta is showing you , it 's a two piece .so , that 's what we 're doing here , and that 's what we 're showing you with the cocktail dress .

hi i 'm les whitley .i 'd like to take a few minutes now and talk to you about how to improve your vertical jump .your vertical jump is again your ability to push force into the ground to propel your body upward overcoming the forces of gravity , traveling upward through space .knowing where you start or knowing where your vertical jump is to begin with is a great way to start .once you identify what your vertical jump is usually measured in inches you know where you want to go and how far you want to progress from as little as a gain of one inch up to three inches over the course of a six to a twelve week time frame is actually a pretty good improvement .putting force in the ground means that you have got to get stronger , utilizing exercises such as the squat , to develop a good base of power for the lower body.
what we 're going to talk about is a general safety guideline when it comes to consumer legal fireworks .the only firework that can safely be held in the hand and lit would be the common sparkler .even though the common sparkler burns at a very high and hot temperature , it poses the hazard of burn injuries .the common sparkler can be held unlit by the user , and then lit by the ignition person or the shooter .once lit , it should be held at arms length , to prevent any type of burn injury .other types of consumer fireworks , like this fountain that sprays showers of sparks , bottle rockets , roman candles , or other types of consumer fireworks should never be held in the hand and ignited .they should be placed firmly on a flat surface , and then ignited by someone designated as the ignition person or shooter .this person should be a responsible adult .i 'm captain joe bruni .stay safe , and we 'll see ya ' next time .

what about your art makes you passionate ?one of the things in finding your message and finding your story that 's so important , is that if you know where your art came from .and you know what kind of things go into your art , it  s going to be so much more powerful if you have something to say .if you just feel like you want to make art , just to make art for arts sake , then why is it going to matter ?it  s not going to matter to you .it  s not going to keep you going when times get tough .this is an incredibly important part of marketing .because if you do n't realize , if you do n't know what your core value is .what you are committed to .what you 're going out to try and perform .what you are trying to change the world by doing .you 're going to be much more likely to give up when the going gets tough .let me promise you , the going will get tough .there will be times when you are making very little money for doing what you really love to do .and then your heart will go , man am i failing at what i really want to do ?what i really love to do .so , what are you passionate about ?find it .go and find that thing .man.

next i 'm going to go over some different techniques that i use to edit my midi data .when editing midi data , there 's a lot of different tools , and a lot of different tool boxes within pearl tools that helps you and kind of gives you short cuts as far as editing .but usually the best way to do is really just to go in and manually edit certain things .so what i 'm going to do is show you how to manually go in and fix certain mistakes and edit certain things as far as like recording data and trying to split up the notes and trying to separate things and really get everything really organized in a good way.

how ya doing there .i 'm simon bingham , and this is no comply skateboard shop , and we are located in austin , texas .i 'm going to tell you a little bit about the materials that go into a skateboard deck .first off , the most important material that goes into a skateboard deck is the wood , which is harvested from maple .it 's 'cause it 's pretty much the only kind of wood that you can use in a skateboard deck .and they have come to that conclusion up to now .throughout the sixties and seventies , they mostly used , actually , they used fiberglass , and they tried it with metal .they tried it with porcelain , they tried all different types of things , but nothing really worked like maple .and they really did n't figure out the maple until they started doing more different shapes and stuff like that , and there was n't really any malleable wood that would ...
i got to give several keys out .so what we 're going to do is we 're going to put these identifying little covers on the keys .but the only problem is these do n't quite fit .so it looks i need to grind off , just a little bit off of each of these keys .so how we 're going to do.
i 'm jeanna rock , and we 're discussing how to lead a book discussion .first of all , make sure that you read the book .and encourage the other members of your group to read it as well .i know that sometimes it 's hard for us to get through a novel in a month , or whatever the time limit is , but it 's hard to have a discussion if everyone has n't read a novel , and quite often if the book has a surprise ending , we 're a little bit hesitant to discuss that .in our book group , the rule is we 're going to have spoilers .if you did n't read the book , that 's your problem , we 're going to talk about it , and we 're going to talk about all the surprising instances that happened as well .so make sure that everyone reads .be sure that you have a list of some questions that will lead to a good discussion , and try to tie some of those questions in with books that you 've read before as well .making those connections is very important .include everyone in your discussion .make sure that not one person sits there and does not participate at all .quite often we have people who dominate the discussion , and that is not helpful .we want everyone to participate , we want everyone 's ideas to be presented to the group .also , do n't allow people to go off too far on tangents .i know sometimes it 's very interesting and sometimes it 's enlightening to do that , but keep your discussion on the book , and leave time at the end for discussing things that do n't have anything to do with the book .
so , once we 're comfortable with that hand ghost note accent pattern , we can add the bass drum back in , maybe just on one.
the other one as well ; from this hand too .maybe a little bit here from the hand .okay , that looks okay to me ; maybe a tiny little bit from here .
tomatoes are the number one vegetable in the country .why , well , because it 's easy to grow , and it gives you good production .everybody likes tomatoes for some of their salads , and other dishes .this tomato , of course , is one that i picked just the other day from my own little earth box , and you , of course , could have them in yours as well .tomatoes need full sun .if they do n't get six hours of bright sun a day , you 're not going to get good results .remember of course , to pick the variety that does best in your area .some of the varieties are a little bit picky when it comes to nighttime temperature .yup , nighttime temperature can affect how they flower , and how they produce .if you want the bigger fruited tomatoes , you need to make sure that you have enough warmth at night that they can flower and fruit .sometimes you 'll find some products in your local nursery that tend to help , called blossom set , especially when it 's on the cool side .tomatoes , of course are easy to grow .you may pick out some of the suckers , and make sure of course you 've either got little cherries , you 've got some of the strawberry types , or some of the large varieties , as well .tomatoes make a nice addition to the vegetable garden , and you 'll be glad that you have them .for on gardening , i 'm stan de freitas , mr.
what i 'm going to talk about is how to identify that a bite has been possible caused by the black widow spider .the black widow spider will leave some type of reddening mark on the skin which will begin to swell and grow and spread in it 's redness .it could also turn purplish or black and blue relatively quickly .also some of the signs and symptoms that would go with that redness , would possibly be cramps , or muscle cramp type of feeling in that bite area spreading throughout other areas of the body .there are also maybe localized pain or pain in the abdomen and back area shortly after the bite of the black widow spider .there could also be vomiting and dizziness or heavy nausea that may occur .if any of these symptoms start to show themselves after what is a suspected bite from a black widow spider , apply ice at regular intervals about twenty minutes on and twenty minutes off , clean the site with soap and water and get the individual to medical attention where anti venom for the black widow spider can be administered .again the bite of the black widow spider would be redness , possible muscle cramping in that area , cramping in the back and abdomen , nausea , dizziness and maybe even altered states of consciousness .the important thing is to clean it , treat if for swelling and get the person to medical attention so it can be treated with some type of anti venom .i 'm captain joe bruni stay safe and we 'll see you next time .
like if his tail is tucked , then he 's afraid and you should not be petting him at that time and you should not be petting him at that time .you never pet a dog when he is afraid , because that will make him more afraid .if it is laying loosey like this , this is just normal .when he 's waging his tail.

this is rachel , with nutrolution , in miami beach , florida .in this clip , we 're talking about what are the different types of ginseng .so first , ginseng is a root , and there 's all different ways that you can prepare it .but it 's a root that grows in the ground , and people will use it .they 've use it throughout history ; making it as teas , grinding it up and adding it as a spice to things even , although it does n't taste so good .people even take the powder plain .and one of the things ginseng does is it actually really boosts your energy .so , it boosts your circulation , it boosts brain function .it gives a a kind of a powerful form of energy .now , there are different types of ginseng .there 's korean ginseng.
as i said , and i did with the other figures before that it helps later when you put the coatings to have a better finish .the problem with the clay , water-based clay , is that when you work for long , it starts drying , you can see .and then these particles , they start adding on the wet clay that still you are working with and then they make like a little grain ; it 's a little pain .then this , it helps putting everything together and making the surface spark even , okay ?and also with some kind of a texture that -- it helps later with the appearance .i mean , it looks better when you paint it .and so , if you feel that there is some kind of bumps or some kind of edges that you do n't like ,you just smooth this down , right there , like this , and it looks much better .you can see now the face .you want --no .yeah .okay .we finished the shaping and we finished already the figurine and the texturing .okay .now , we are going to let it dry for almost four days .yes , four or five days .then after that , we 're going to use several kinds of coatings in order to protect the figurine .and then it 's going to be self-drying .it 's a self-drying clay.

the fish that we are going identify now is the blackbar soldierfish .the blackbar soldierfish is a member of the squirrelfish family .most fishes in the squirrelfish family are reddish in color and have large eyes .the blackbar soldierfish is no exception to this .what makes the blackbar soldierfish distinctive is a single black bar found just behind its head making it look like a shoulder stripe on a soldier .they are also usually a bright red color and rarely a pale red unlike other squirrelfishes .they have large dark eyes which are necessary for them to see well at night when they are most active .during the day , most blackbar soldierfish can often be seen hanging out in cracks and crevices of the reef , in caves and in the shade under coral ledges .blackbar soldierfish are schooling fish , and usually found in small groups .they will watch divers cautiously but will quickly dart into a hole in the reef if they feel threatened .if you get close enough to a blackbar soldierfish , you will also note that the leading edge of most of their fins , have a thin white line of color .blackbar soldierfish are usually three to six inches in length .that 's the blackbar soldierfish .
well in essence , what we want to do is create one consistent response .if we can learn to do one thing really well , we get pretty good at it .in golf , all you need is one good swing .it works on your putting , your chipping , your pitching , and even your driver .in essence , your hands and the clubs start it back , your arms swing the club at your target .your hands and your clubs swing it back .your arms swing you  re the club at your target .on a full swing , the hands and club start it back and your arms swing the club at the target .consistency is gripping it the same , having good towards , aiming it the same , and making the same 2 good parts of the swing .the good back swing and a good forward swing .you control the distance by how far you take your hands and the club back and how fast you swing your arms on a forward swing .one controls the arch , the other one controls the club head speed .all you need is one consistent swing .does this sound simple ?well let me tell you something , it is simple .it  s called the kiss method .keep it simple stupid .why ?because the physical part of the game is not the hard part .golf is a brain game .you have to think the ball around the course .look at all the mini middle obstacles you have to overcome .imagine 50 people watching you tee off on the first tee .now , imagine tiger woods with about 2 ,000.imagine 2 ,000 people watching you put a 3 footer in the last hole to win the u.s.
what we 're going to talk about is some common safety guidelines when it comes to legal consumer fireworks .one of those guidelines involves horseplay or boisterous conduct .at no time should horseplay or boisterous conduct be permitted by the users or by the person designated as the ignition person or the shooter .if this type of behavior takes place it should be put a stop to immediately .it would also serve to appoint somebody as a safety person to supervise the lighting of fireworks , that 's uninvolved with the actual ignition and use of these consumer legal fireworks .horseplay and boisterous conduct has resulted in many burn injuries and blast injuries over the years in the united states .i 'm captain joe bruni .stay safe , and we 'll see ya ' next time .
the next area i want to talk about is shadowboxing with an imaginary opponent .it 's important to have imagination , but in shadowboxing we 're going to use it .in some cases this could be the last guy you lost against .just keep that in mind when you 're shadowboxing .in other cases it could be the next guy you 're going to box against .you know , keep that in mind when you 're shadowboxing .but it 's very important to be able to other people can see on your face that there 's somebody in there you 're boxing with .it 's going to allow that much more room for excitement , that much more breaking up of your routine if you 're getting in there.
if you have a bumpy or wrinkly surface than it is not going to stick properly .and also we are going to doctor the top.
if you don  t hit the ball towards your target you may never get there , and you  re definitely not going to beat anybody .now , people here the word towards .what does towards mean ?well , to start out with , it means how you set up to the ball .if you don  t set up square to your target , you  re in trouble .so when you set up to a golf ball it  s very simple .your knees are flexed , your fanny  s out , and you  re built comfortably from the waist .you look like a linebacker , a short stop , a tennis player , a golfer : they  re.

continuing with nia and putting it all together , we 're going to combine some martial arts movements with some leg movements .so we start out with some blocks .starting out in a stance , an open stance , comfortable , relax knees , hands right here , open hands .we have block up , block down , block up , step back , switch .block , block block , step back , switch .block , block block , step back , switch .block , block block , step back , switch .if you want you can have a little jump to that switch .step back , switch .or you could simply step back , switch .block , block block , step back , switch .precise , block , block block , step back , switch .block , block block , step back , switch .step back , switch .block , block block , step back , switch .so imagine you 're kind of sneaking up .sneaking up .so take your time , block , block block , step back , switch .block , block block , step back , switch .you want to add sound , you can go `` hop , hop hop , step back , switch .hop , hop hop , step back , switch .hop , hop hop .block with feet , legs .
another very important part of a weight management program is understanding energy sources .the body has 2 sources of the energy that it needs .it could either burn fat or it can burn sugar .naturally we 're all trying to burn fat because we 're all trying to streamline our bodies.
and you will have lovely lollipops .good .alright , put it on the top .so you can put it in to this lollipop maker and put the top on and put it in to the freezer until the next day .i am sure that we all want to raise our children as healthy as possible , so why not start it at the very early age when the accept everything from us to help them to accept a healthy life style .
now , let 's talk about some of the differences in spinning reels .now , spinning reels are probably the most versatile fishing tackle that really exists .you can use anywhere from a little mini cast to a little mini spinning like this , maybe two to four pound test line , use it for crappie fishing or , you know , your smaller stuff , makes a small fishing to a brawny fighter .lot of fun .generally use about a four and half , five foot rod .makes a nice balance .then you go into a normal flex rod which is this right here , this is a seven foot , with a 4 ,000 size stratic reel , ten , twelve pound test line .good for intermediate type fishing and shore fishing .and then , if you need heavier spinning gear , they have it where it 's suited to go up to 30 , 40 pound test line .this is a big pen spinning outfit that we actually catch 100 pound tarpon with .but , with the combination , you need a rod too.
in this clip i 'm going to talk about the age old question of whether you should write the words first , or the lyrics first , or do it at the same time .there is no answer to that question .everybody works differently.
you want to make sure that you 're actually getting hydrated , if you have big games , if you have anything that you know that you 're going into , you want to say - make sure that you 're hydrating yourself during the week and especially the night before , and that means really staying away from alcohol , obviously , that means staying away from sodas , you really want to get as much water into your system if you know that there 's a point in the next day or so that you 're going to be perspiring , you know , at a rate that you should really hydrate yourself .once you get to that point and you have n't hydrated yourself you really put yourself in danger .you can pass out , there 's actually kidney failures .it 's a very dangerous thing not to hydrate yourself .so , really when you 're exercising at any level , you want to make sure that you 're carrying water with you or that there 's water available .and it does n't matter if it 's just an easy walk around your neighborhood , if it 's a full out marathon or if it 's playing football like steve does .you want to make sure that you 've always got water on hand .it can be the matter between life and death .
so , this one we 're going to do another waiting move .this is just stepping forward on your right foot and our left foot.
now , the equivalent of grain in film , is the noise in digital cameras .so , if you turn up the iso to 3200 , which is very high , it will take pictures at night , but it 'll also increase the amount of noise you have .with intelligent iso , it will change the iso , which is impossible on a film camera , but it will change in a digital camera and give you more noise , but better exposure and shutter speed levels .some other things that are important are in a prosumer model.
in this clip we 'll be talking about crescent kicks .the first crescent kick is an outside inside crescent kick which looks like .in order to do an outside inside crescent kick , when you first pick up your foot you ?re picking up like a front kick chamber .with you knee pointed slightly off to the side of your target at eleven o'clock .as you kick you bring it across to two o'clock , re-chamber , and set it down .when you do your kick you want to make sure that you hit your target with the top of your foot and to generate power.

this discussion is on excess f.i.c.a.
it 's going to sop up a lot of this flavor .then we want to go ahead and grab a laddel see how nice and thick that has become again.
now we 're going to show you how to stop a breakaway or approach a breakaway .the first thing is that when a breakaway is coming at you , you want to make sure that you skate out .depending on where the breakaway is happening or how far away it is away from you , you want to come out to no further than the hash marks .kind of use that energy and momentum to skate yourself backward as the shot is coming , but you do n't want to come out too far , because if you do , the player can come around and score in empty net .now we 're going to have a breakaway coming down .now as you can see , that momentum that you use to bring yourself back helps you prepare for a save .and that 's how to stop a basic breakaway .
if you are like me you wind up eating , sometimes at restaurants that are not fancy enough to have cloth napkins so they have paper napkins .so you bring along your zig markers and you pull them out.
these are coming together nicely just keep stirring it.
now most of the problems that we have with gates is that over a period of time they start to sag and you wo n't be able to open them because they 'll start dragging on the ground .so if you have this situation the best way to fix this , is you 'll see on the back side.
so , you want to make small talk .a few guidelines , no religion , no politics , and ask questions .you 've gone to a , art museum and kind of a function afterwards .it 's going to be a situation where you 're going to have hors d oeuvres , you 're going to have some wine , and you 're going to talk to other people .how do you happen to know the hostess ?you 've got an open end question .small talk , one never knows where the small talk will go .woman to woman , where did you get the shoes ?man to man , have you picked up the tickets for the rays game ?whatever it might be , small talk , then focus on what the other finds interesting , and what you have in common .it 's an easy way to expand into more small talk , and who knows , maybe even a friendship .so again , there are no small topics , only small people .but you 're a bigger person , so involve yourself with small talk , and enjoy your life .this is dr.
so if we take a look at the shifting and what is actually going on on the bicycle , once you have got it in your stand here and you are running through the bike you can notice if it is moving too far up or too low once you have got it spinning there .the way you do that is you address it here and your barrel adjuster .so if i need more tension.
so we 're going to ask faith to start out in tadasana , lengthening up , rooting down through her feet and reaching through the crown of her head .she 's going to inhale and reach her arms up to the sky .lifting out of her waist , she 's lengthen up.
hi , my name is teri and in this segment , we 're going to talk about how to minimize your pores .now it 's important to realize why some parts of our face have larger pores on them than others .now sometimes it 's hereditary , sometimes if we had excess acne when we were younger , that can cause larger pores in certain areas .but often , for most of us , it 's because we have extra dirt or oil in those areas and that 's where it tends to collect , usually in around the nose area , or the forehead , and sometimes the jaw line and chin area .that 's where you 're going to see the larger pores .there 's literally hundreds , if not thousands of products on the market that will help with pore minimizing .now some of them range from very inexpensive to quite expensive .i 'm going to go over a couple of options with you .now of course , this is a standard thing you should be using every day .it 's a toner .now you can get it with alcohol , or alcohol-free .if you have quite dry skin , stay away from an alcohol based product , use an alcohol-free toner .then we also have the pore minimizing daily facial wash , and that comes in a lot of different brands and products .usually that has some sort of scrub in it and that just cleans out those pores to try to get them to shrink down , get the oil and dirt out .we also have pore strips , minimizing strips .those come with a lot of different brands carry those .they usually fit around your nose or forehead area .when you peel them off , it takes the dirt that 's been in those pores .pulls 'em right out .and then , you could also invest in a cheap , or expensive if you choose , micro-dermabrasion kit at home .those are all the rage these days and they really do work .use them once a week , and you will see a result within four to six weeks of minimizing of your pores .now , if you want to use a product , just straight from the kitchen , do n't want to spend any money , egg whites .you whip up your egg whites from an egg , just put it on your face like a mask .let it sit and dry , wash it off .you do that once a week , you should notice an improvement in your pores as well .
in this step we will be assembling the sides to the front and back of the bird house .first , we caulk the side .be sure to , sure you only draw the heads down flush with the side panels .you will caulk the back side the same way you did , both sides are caulked the same way .all you need is a very little bit of caulk .be sure you caulk across the bottom .now , when you attach these sides , be sure that the , you 're flush with the bottom when you do this .we 're going to put four screws in this side .that is how you assemble the two sides to the bird house .
our lesson is drawing ; more specifically , drawing cars .even more specifically , we are going to detail them .do n't get out your wash bucket or anything .we are not going to get our hands wet .we are going to bring out the details of the car like going back into our drawing .we are going to start by defining these wheels more .we just had drawn shapes here .so you might have to break out a ruler if you want it to be a design that might call for that.
in doing so , you 've got to stimulate that muscle for maximum growth to give you a good muscular developed base .but once you get that good muscular developed base , you have to reduce the body fat levels in order to be able to see the fruits of your labor .so , muscle building exercises such as a bicep curl , by utilizing dumbbells or barbell , to strengthen and tone the muscles will get you a good start , but in order to see the results of that , you 've got to reduce that overall body fat level to develop that nice , toned look .in doing so , you 've got to modify your diet to reduce the calories you 're taking in or take in more quality , higher quality foods .but also increase your energy expenditure by being more active overall in your daily lifestyle .not just when you 're spending time exercising , while you 're on the treadmill or out for a jog , but also the time that you spend away from the gym.
and it 's an easy way to add style to your house plant .there are a lot of planters that you can select from ; they all can add style to your house .this ceramic container right here i love it because it just has a lot of style to it , it 's very simple too .i think style should be simple.
in this clip i 'm going to discuss the usage of stick wrap , why we use it.
what attracts fleas ?well , fleas are a animal that are completely and totally motivated by their stomach .so what attracts the flea ?well , food sources attract the flea .and what means food to a flea ?warmth and heat are going to indicate food , or some sort of food source passing by the flea .movement is going to indicate that , the vibrations on the ground , somebody walking.
in this step i want to talk to you and sheena obviously , how to and how to select your concealer .now in your example , you said your skin tends to be a little drier at the moment with a little bit of redness and small blemish here and there .i really think that you personally would benefit from a concealer that has a nice cream consistency but , but also stay put .it is very important that the concealer really conceals because that 's what it 's supposed to do .and you also do n't want it to blend off or smudge off after , just a few minutes .since you 're spending money on a product , it should really work .there , a good trick is , if the concealer really covers up , is to , if you are in the store and you have the chance to test your product , is to check on the back of your hand and try to cover up , you know , any blue veins that you see there , usually a little more visible on fair-skin people .so let 's see , i would probably go with something a little yellow base , i 'm kind of in between there .so maybe the first two shades , lighter too like a medium light .and then if you manage to kind of cover up the vein , that 's usually your shade .your concealer should always be slightly lighter than your foundation .
hi , i 'm lucy spain here to show you how to do splits in cheerleading .cheerleading splits are a commonly used pose to do when you 're doing a cheerleading formation .you can also use these splits in your stunts as well , once the fliers have gotten good at them .it 's important to make sure you stretch out when doing a cheerleading split .we 're going to concentrate on the left and right splits .this is going to be a right split with your right leg out forward .first we want to start out with our right leg forward .we 're going to stretch forward .make sure your knee is at a ninety-degree angle .we do n't want our knee to go past our toe .so we 're going to stretch forward into it .after you do this stretch for about fifteen seconds , you want to lean back and stretch the underneath of the leg .stay back in this stretch for about fifteen minutes .you can lean your chest forward on this one as well .after that , you can simply slide into your split .a common pose you can use is the high v once you 're in your split .that 's the right split .the left split is going to be the exact same thing to the other side .ninety degree angle .make sure we get a nice stretch on the inside of your thigh , lean back and stretch the underneath of our leg , and we 're going to slide into our left split and hit our high v.
our next advanced technique , in continuation with ushiro waza techniques from behind , is called ryote kubi dori dai sankyo.
either we are just going to freshen it needs just a little bit of wrinkles taking out that has been cause by hanging out in the closet being pushed up to other clothes .we are going to go for the pleat in front the seam.
any time you do an acupressure session you 'll always want to close it carefully .you do n't want to grab the dog go running and play ball with them .you do n't want to run out and feed them their dinner .you want to spend a few minutes of quiet time as you end the massage .you can sit and pet them , talk to them or just sit quietly with them and let them relax a little bit , let them actually absorb the energy that you 've moved around the body and feel better and give them a few minutes to relax too and that way they will get the most benefit from the session .if they jump up immediately the muscles start tightening , the back starts tightening and you 'll undo what you 've done so always spend a few minutes of just quiet time .you can do it toward the end of the day or at a point when the dog is going to have some rest , that 's best so that then they are in quiet time.
i 'm using black beans .i love beans , these beans .i love black beans .i love to eat them .so , i 'm going to use them in the shaker .and , an actual shaker .it 's small in cylinder and not too long .i took this from my granddaughter .this was something that her candy came in .i just stripped off the label .and , it actually have tabs on the end to secure the beans in there .so , we 're going to take this and create a small shaker .
we 're learning how to cornrow and adding extensions into these cornrows .okay so down here as you see we 've created this one braid .so what to do now ?you could keep going on and braiding but ashley actually wants a pony tail at the end , when it 's all said and done , she 'd like a pony tail , and so we 're going to give her that first section .so basically all the rest of the braids are going to have this extra hair hanging out.
and we are going to sew on the wrong side of the fabric .so we get them matched up nice and straight , take them to our machine.
it 's a nice effect in some of his work with aerosmith .and , again an effect that 's complimentary for both rhythm and lead , clean or distorted tones .so , and what the vibe effect is or univibe is something like the pedal is called .it 's simply this .kind of creates what they use to call tremolo or vibrato .like some of the old fender amps that used to come stocked in those amps back in the day like sixties and seventies .so , in this example what i 'm going to simply use is just for like a chordal type thing you might use in a verse pre-chorus or chorus in a song .and , it 's just simply going .now , without the effect .and , so with the effect what it does is just gives it again another dimension .and , i 've heard this effect also in like bands like sound garden and some other bands where they just use it just again to kind of take you somewhere else in a song .so , again just using that simple picking pattern using an a major chord .and , you know what you have is a nice vibe sounding effect used in the context of a rhythm .
i say great .write the story .forget about everything else , and put all of your passion , and everything you have , into creating that story , because when you do , you will create the best story you possibly can , and it has nothing to do with money , and it has nothing to do with wealth and fame , and fortune .i think the best pay , i 'm going to say the best thing that happened to me , when i was writing , is i 'd written a children 's book ,that i called charlie 's treasures , and it really is an inspired work .it 's about a young boy , who shares his most valued treasures , which is this bag of marbles , which are really a metaphor , for people that we meet in our lives , and we debuted it at the la times festival of books , which from a financial standpoint , was horribly unsuccessful .i did n't sell enough books to pay for the booth , not even pay for my gas .probably not even paid for the parking , and the food , but i had a man at the end of the book festival , stand at my booth , and read the book cover to cover , and he looked up at me with a tear in his eye , and.
now i am ready to make the lid with the beads and the sequences and get it ready to be attached to the kaleidoscope .the first thing i want to do before i start decorating the lid is to make a hole in the middle and that same hole is going to be where it sits on the kaleidoscope on our wooden stick that is already attached to it .so i can take any sharp object .i just happened to take another skewer that the sharp end can make a nice hole right into the middle of the lid .and now i am going to put glue around the lid.
my favorite august costume.
what i 'm going to discuss and talk about , is how to basically assess a persons vitals signs without using any technical instruments .like a blood pressure cuff and stethoscope or things along those lines .the first thing that we want to assess is their level of consciousness through the pupils .ask them do they know where they are , do they know their name and to see if they are alert and oriented .we can also take a light , shine it in the persons eyes to see if the pupils are equal and reactive .and if they are symmetrical and of the same size .level of consciousness .the next thing we want to determine is pulse rate .we can gain the pulse rate or gage the pulse rate by feeling the radial pulse in the wrist or the carotid pulse up in the neck line .count the beats for fifteen seconds .multiply it by four for our heart rate .we would then move on to respiratory rate and count the respiratory rate watching rising chest fall .or stomach rise and fall for fifteen seconds .multiplying by four .checking skin condition by examining whether they are pink and flushed , or pale and sweaty , or cool and clammy .which would be a poor indicator .and finally checking capillary refill or circulation by taking a pen or some type of hard object like our fingernail .pressing down on the nail bed and watching the white spot turn back to pink .in the time it takes to say the words capillary refill that nail bed should have flushed back pink again .all a good vital sign .basic steps in determining vital signs without using any type of instruments or measuring equipment .i 'm captain joe bruni .stay safe .and we 'll see you next time .
the most common play in virtually all forms of solitaire is moving a card or cards from the tableau to the foundation .in fan , the way that starts is , when you have an ace that you can play , and right now i have eighteen playable cards in front of me .i have the top card of each fan , this , this is the top , the card that does n't have any cards over it , that 's the top card of each fan .and then i 've got the free card , the lone card .right now , to move a card to the foundation , it has to be an ace .foundations are built up , ace , two , three , four and so on .so , i 'm looking for , for aces to move down to the foundation .here 's another one .and these two aces are not in play right now because this eight is blocking it .but i can build on my ace of diamonds and ace of hearts .ace of hearts , here 's the two of hearts that 's in play , two of diamonds ,sorry , there 's the three of diamonds , there 's the two of hearts and so on .

this cocktail is called the burgundy bishop .go ahead and fill your glass up with ice , and we are going to chill these ingredients .we 're going to do an ounce of light rum , a teaspoon of powdered sugar , that 's probably good , and about 1/4 of an ounce of lemon juice , that 'll work right there , now chill all those together .now take your cocktail glass , i am going to use a martini glass , because i feel like being fancy , you can do this in a wine glass , or you can do it like in a highball glass , and strain those ingredients into the glass .on top of that , we are going to pour red wine , any type of red wine will do , this is sort of like a red wine cocktail , there we go .so , you have rum , lemon , sugar , and red wine , that is your burgundy bishop .cheers .
there are many different tools used by a dental assistant to help facilitate treatment with the dentist , but these are the most important ones that a denta , dental assistant will use , this one being what 's called the air/water syringe .this one is also called a saliva ejector , and this one 's called a high volume evacuator .all of these instruments are used for either delivering water to the mouth in different ways , or air also , as well as suctioning out debris , spit , saliva , things like that .so , for the first one , this is what we call our air/water syringe .this is probably one of the most important ones .this one allows the assistant to basically eject air or water or both into the patient 's mouth .oftentimes , while the dentist is working ; whether it be taking a cavity out , or removing something the air , the air basically can be used to help keep the the field of view clear , and also make the patient comfortable .it also can eject water with the other button just to basically flush out any sort of irritants or debris that 's again , in the way .this one is the , what 's called the saliva ejector .this is the one you typically will encounter when you get a cleaning , and sometimes during routine fillings .this one is responsible for taking out , again debris and and saliva .some people like to call it the spit sucker .this is essentially what this is .it literally takes out the spit and saliva out of your mouth in a very quick , efficient manner like so .the last one we have is what 's called the high volume evacuator .this is the one most commonly used during fillings .so , if a dentist is either preparing a cavity , or they are removing an old filling this one generates a lot more suction .it 's also a lot louder , but this one is , again response for also assisting in keeping the field clear , but most importantly , it prevents any larger objects going into the back of the mouth .
in this clip we 're going to talk about the proper service procedure to replace your engines timing belt and water pump .in this step we 're going to talk about the proper service procedure for removing a cam shaft sprocket .and what we have here is a dual overhead cam engine .remove these air conditioning lines and you can see these are the cam shaft sprockets , and they 're over the cylinder head and there 's two of them.

alright so now let  s try a warrior three with a plie .this is a more advanced version .make sure you get the full warrior before you get into a warrior three with the plie .and plie if you are doing ballet is just a little bending of the knees .it 's a tiny bend , not a big bend , protect your knees at all costs .setting up for your warrior three , bring the leg back and the arms forward .now as you bend your supporting leg you really need to stretch the hands forward and the leg to the back .tiny plie and lengthen , tiny plie there 's your bend and come back to straight .tiny plie and back to straight .keep in mind that your core is really working whenever you do this .as the leg bends , keep it a tiny bend , stretch away from your core , leg going in one direction , head the other .as you do this.
blood money is a registered trademark of io interactive , a company with which i have no affiliation .now we will actually go ahead and take this guy 's suit because some of the places that we need to go is more of an area for a worker than it is for the hitman .and so it will be easier to get through the level in the worker 's suit but we will pay the penalty for leaving our suit behind.
now i 'm going to talk about castanets .this is a very popular instrument in spain .you 'll see dancers using them , especially in pairs .now , essentially , a castanet here ; here 's a more traditional model actually made in spain .now you 'll see the inside is carved out , usually made of wood .now , the inside is carved to allow a chamber for the tone of the castanets to resonate in .the idea of this instrument is to have a small opening , so that when they make contact with the hand they make that clapping sound .now , you might also use those on their own , where you have a pair of castanets , such as these here , where you might wrap around your wrist , and so instead of just having one castanet you 'll have a pair , where in your right hand you 'll be doing that ; the same with the left hand ; creating different rhythms , similar to what you saw with the maracas .
all right , folks , in this clip , i 'm going to teach you how to draw rappers , hip hop artists .all right , so we 'll start with the face and work our way down .now one thing i would do , personally , is i would give these guys some character .i mean , if you 're going to be drawing hip hop , or rappers , or anything like that , it 's probably best not to make them look weak in any way .i would come in here.
hi today we are going to do relaxation therapy for the forearm .when of the things about the forearm is that is where all the muscles are that control the hand .so it becomes very important to work the forearm itself specifically .and in doing this , as always , you have to begin a relaxation therapy session by accessing the tonal quality of the muscles .gentle squeezing , maybe some slight effleurage.
now that we 've finished getting our drum ready for tuning - step one , pretty much - we 're going to start the actual tuning , listening in , checking for that sound quality , making sure all lugs are the same exact sound .so you 're going to start , right now , with this first one .i want to hear.
alright now when you 're considering your choices of humor i want talk to you for a minute about being vulgar .alright , in certain audiences.
this first drill is very simply kicking on your side and how to use the head pillow , rest your head on your forearm .and when you need to breathe , you can just turn your head .when you 're ready to rotate to another side , you can shift .you can do one lap on one side and one on the other , or switch as you go along .but it develops the ability to kick on your side .the front crawl is really a misnomer because it 's only one-third , at best , on your front .rotation is the key to successful , efficient swimming .and the final drill is what we call the three-four flip-flop .you do three strokes of front crawl , and then rotate onto your back , four strokes onto your back , and rotate on the front .again , the idea being that it gets you rotating on both sides and gets you comfortable and flexible with the rotation needed to be an efficient swimmer .
go ahead and fill it up with sour mix almost to the top there and let 's shake those ingredients .this should have a nice raspberry tart flavor to it with the sour mix and the raspberry liquor and let 's pour that in and.
the marine organism we 're going to identify now is the peacock flounder .the peacock flounder is the most common flounder that one will find around the coral reefs of florida , the bahamas , and most of the caribbean .they 're distinguished by the numerous blue ringed spots covering its body , although the blue is often muted .these blue rings are what distinguished the peacock flounder from the similar appearing eyed flounder , whose rings are brown .peacock flounders , like eyed flounders , also have two and sometimes three , large defuse dark spots along the lateral line of the top side of their body .one usually behind the pectoral fin and the second about midway between the pectoral fin and the tail .the underside of the peacock flounder is a pale white to yellowish color , with no distinctive markings .the peacock flounder is a master of camouflage , they can rapidly change color and shading , to blend into their surroundings .their coloring can go from very pale , when they are over sand , to quite dark , when they are over coral .in addition , they will occasionally cover themselves with a fine layer of sand , making them even harder to spot .they spend most of their time skimming over the sand near reefs .peacock flounders are strange fish .they start their life like a normal fish , swimming upright with eyes on both sides of its head , but as they mature , one eye slowly moves to the opposite side of its body until both eyes are on one side and they can lay flat on the bottom without being noticed .the eyes can move independently so the peacock flounder has a great view of the world surrounding him or her .peacock flounders also have a very long pectoral fin on the top side of their body .this fin will often be raised while they are swimming across the bottom and will look like a small sail .i suspect they use this raised pectoral fin as a rudder , as they swim in an undulating fashion just above the sand or coral .adult peacock flounders range in size from six inches to eighteen inches with most being fifteen inches long or smaller .they are most commonly found in sand flats at a depth of two feet to forty feet .when they lay motionless on the bottom , in the sand , you might not even see them until you swim right over the top of the fish , which will quickly swim away if it feels threatened .peacock flounders feed mainly on small fishes they find in their sandy habitat .they will also feed on small crustaceans , such as , small hermit crabs , as well as small octopi .that 's the peacock flounder .
the foliage itself has stripes and they 're not like mirrors .most foliage is like a mirror -- there are stripes on both sides of the foliage -- but the cleopatra , it might have just one burgundy stripes on one side .it 'll be half burgundy and half green .there 's really no rhyme or reason to it .it might have a bloom that 's yellow with red spots , and then right above that it 'll have a pure red flower .so , there 's really no rhyme or reason to it , and it 's not a big canna lily .it only gets maybe 3 or 4 feet tall at the most , so it 's considered a medium .so it does n't really get as big as the durban or the pretoria that can get 8 feet tall .it stays a little more compact , which i really love about it , and no two plants are the same .when i plant 'em , i only put 'em about 3 or 4 inches deep , and i put 'em in groups of three or four or more .they like to be in groups to do well .and you only have to plant 'em , like we said , about 3 inches deep .and there 's little eyes , so the growth will come out of the eyes .so it does n't matter if it 's this way or this way ; as long as they 're covered , they will grow .they multiply quickly , so in 5 or 10 years , you can probably dig 'em up and divide 'em and put 'em in different areas or give them away to your friends and they 'll be your favorite canna lily as well .in the next segment , we 'll talk about tigridia .
so we 're playing a sample round basically of this little game we call bar dice .you won the first hand .we ante again .remember that the qualifying hand is two pair or better .it 's my turn to go first .i roll .there 's a pair of two 's ; i 'm going to try to build on that .nah , let 's have some fun , let 's have some fun .i have an open-ended straight draw .so if i , in this roll , get a one or a six , i 've got a straight .i 've got a one in three shot of doing that .there 's a six .i get a straight .so now you have to beat a straight .you roll .a full house would beat a straight and you 're on your way with two pair .you have a one in three chance of getting a two or a six to win the pot .let 's see what happens .drum roll please .it 's a three .alas , i take the pot .so that 's one pot for you , one pot for me.
all right , the drink that we are about to make is called an auger .and , first thing we 're going to do is put some ice in a glass here and add one shot of vodka .there you go .any vodka will do , top shelf , well , anything in between and follow that up with about four ounces of orange juice .there we go .and , next , we 're going to do about a a half ounce of rose 's sweetened lime juice , any sweetened lime juice will do actually .now let 's mix this up real good .obviously , this is pretty much just a screwdriver.
today we 're here to show you a few bmx tricks .this is the very basic wheelie .boy , i feel weird doing that one .the thing about the wheelie is it 's a very old school trick , and when you do it these days a lot of people ask questions .but the trick to the wheelie is counter-balancing the back of your body and the front end of your bike , kind of making a pyramid ; an upside down pyramid .now , you want to approach it with a little bit of speed , applying torque to your to your pedals .the torque is what keeps the front end up , but keeping your back end balanced is what keeps it very straight .just need a little tiny bit of speed , pull the front end up , and pedal ; just keeping that back end a little bit level .that 's the secret to the to the wheelie .
now to put it together , take one of your units , and take this other unit .this triangle will go underneath the rabbit ear , and then this triangle will get tucked into the pocket of the rabbit.
our website is www.martialartsnc.com .this clip will demonstrate basic anaziwa or throwing techniques .as samurai armor was top heavy , as my opponent attempts a frontal or shonen strike , i 'm going to side step and move with his balance to step in the same direction , disarming him and executing a throw using mostly his balance from the strike .
what we are going now is setting this part of this block together .this is just part of the block .we will make it larger as we go along .but we need to lay it out.
it 's very important that you take your sections small enough and pay close attention .you can see in this section here , where the new growth is and where the grey is .and , just apply just that very small amount of color .you want to just cover the grey only .i do n't want color on all of this previously colored hair .you do n't want to overlap your color .you just want to get it on that grey .otherwise , you end up with an overlap and what we call a line of demarcation .and , you can actually see .tilt your head this way a little bit .there you go .now , you can see where her grey is and where i 'm applying the color .just draw that line , take your parting .take that small section see , when you pull it over it bleeds right through .that 's exactly what you want it to do .apply your color , pull the hair color and watch it bleed through .pull my next section and see how it oozes right through the next section .see how nice and neat you can work by sectioning the hair .getting the hair out of your way .pull that through and watch it ooze right through .just the grey only .i 'm working up to the front .and , all i have left is one section .here 's really , here 's a good part to pay attention to right here on the side of the head .remember , i 've put the conditioner on so it does n't stain her skin .but , i want to get those little grey hairs that grow close to your face .so , just on the grey hair only .and , then now you can actually see the color is starting to process .and , you can go through and see that it is totally covered .that 's how you pay close attention and put color on just the grey hair .
okay let 's get to the main element of fish chowder .quite obviously it is fish .classically , it would be cod that is extremely prevalent off the coast of nova scotia on georgia 's bank and down through boston even to the point they said you could just drop a bushel bucket and pull up fish without ever having to put any bait on it .those days are long gone unfortunately because we 've over fished .so it actually makes it a little more convenient .the one thing you have to think about in terms of fish for fish chowder is not an oily fish .i love salmon.
let 's play our e major scale again .now , let 's talk about our seventh scale degree which is d sharp .third high , third finger on the a string .relationship between sixth scale degree c sharp and seven is a whole step .you 're going to want to make sure that it 's not d natural , make sure it 's d sharp .
the next thing we 're going to talk about now that we understand the function of the wedge formation , is spooking the ambush before you ever end up in sight of it .when we look at the board , we see that the red team is moving on an objective and their direction of travel is indicated here .they 're moving in this direction .the green player is in a heavily covered position , he 's watching this shooting lane , waiting for someone to step into it .now the mark of an inexperienced ambusher is to spring his trap too early , and not let the players move through before he fires on them .one of the things that the point man on this wedge formation should be looking at and concentrating on , is staying close to cover as he moves forward , moving from cover to cover , and trying to step out and step back , so that he can hopefully draw the fire of the green team member who 's set up his ambush here .if he the red player does this effectively , then if he steps out and this guy opens up and he does n't hit him , each of the red players will begin to move still attempting to maintain their wedge formation , so that they can then get an angle on the shooter .once the wedge has moved and it can even become an inverted wedge .once that has occurred and you 've got angles ,other angles on the shooter , that player can be eliminated .
okay , now let 's talk about actions that you can do to maintain those friendships .alright ?always stand up for your friend , especially in his or her absence .you never want to let people trash your friends whether they 're there or not .always give emotional support to your friends .even if you do n't necessarily agree or disagree with what they 're upset about , they still deserve your emotional support .when you guys are together , try to make your friend happy .you know , you want to have a good time and enjoy each other 's company.

for our next step here since this is a virgin hair color what we are going to do is take your brush ( which has a rat tail on the end ) .in a slight diagonal we are going to take about a quarter inch section .now from the root to half way up is what we call your heat zone .so this is a virgin application what you are going to want to do is take it about a inch 1/2 inch to a inch above that .because the thing is heat process cause color .so if we put it right on the scalp it is going to process faster at your scalp then on your ends .you would get what is called hot root .so your scalp 2 inch away would be a lot lighter or even sometimes even deeper then the rest .so what we would go ahead and do is take your brush with your color .now that we have sectioned off the hair into 4 sections , what we are going to do is put our gloves on for safety .and go right into her color .since this is a virgin color , a virgin color application what we are going to do is take it at a 1/4 section here on the top in a slight diagonal .now half a inch is where the application is going to begin .from the scalp to a inch up is what we call a heat zone .now heat will accelerate deep color process .so what you are going to want to do is apply it about an inch to an inch away from the scalp to right about a quarter inch away from the ends .you would go ahead and put that aside , go to your next section same thing about a quarter inch in a slight diagonal .go for your color and apply half a inch to an inch bringing it out , away from that heat zone .bring it through the end here , put that aside and go in for your next .you are going to always want to go away from the face .you do n't want any color falling or dripping to the face and irritate the eyes .same thing about a half a inch to a quarter inch away bringing it through your ends .really work it through , you really want to distribute that color as even as possible .you just continue quarter inch section all the way down , half a inch to a quarter inch away from the heat zone bringing it through .you would continue this process all the way down to the end .so let 's go to our next step .
hi , i 'm gretchen rivas with relax to the max massage therapy .and today we 're going to talk about , how to find a spa .when you 're searching for a spa , one of the things you want to think about is , what it is that you 're exactly looking for .and if all you 're looking for is a massage , you may not need a full all out spa facility , but if you 're looking for aroma wraps , or seaweed wraps , hot stone treatments and some various other things that might involve showers , you might want a full fledge spa routine that 's available at some spas .so you would want to start by looking in some of the-you might want to look in the yellow pages , and you can google spas for this particular town that you 're going to , or that you live in , and see what they come up .and check out their websites and see what they have to say , because a lot of times you can get a lot more information out of the website than you can out of the yellow pages .and then the other thing i would do is , i would call and talk to the person at the spa , and ask them some questions about , what their facility is like , what they offer , how long their therapist have been in training , and how long they 've been out of school , and just get some information .because a lot of times spas hire people fresh out of school that really are n't the best therapist if you 're looking for massage work .the other thing you can do is , ask your friends and family if they 've been to a spa , and what they thought about it .and then once you find one that you think that you might want to go to ,before you book an appointment , you might want to just drop in and see what the facility is like , and then you can always book your massage or your spa treatment that day , after you 've looked at everything and make sure it 's clean enough to the standards that you 're looking for .so i hope those hints helped you on how to find a spa .

hi this is taylor and we are here talking about hp cartridges and today we are going to discuss how to fill an hp c9396a .it is also an hp 88 which we will now show how to refill .the hp 88 cartridges are all refilled in the same manner .it does n't matter if they are extra larges , black or any other colors .to start refilling simply cut along the top line here on both sides , cutting just the sticker and the cap simply pops off .once you remove the top you can see the pump , the nozzle , and then the fill area .to get into the fill area you need to remove the rubber ball in this area .do not lose it you will need to use it later .once you have removed the ball put it on the side .the next step in refilling the 88 is to inflate the inside bag .to do this just get a syringe without a needle , stick in the side and inject the area .the next step is to actually inject the cartridge with the ink .to fill the ink bladder only insert the needle just about an inch , do not press too hard or you can pop the bag .slowly inject the ink filling the reservoir .it should take about 20 milliliters .once you have filled the 88 with the ink , replace the rubber ball , press down firmly until you feel it click into place .the next thing you need to make sure that there is no air .if there is air simply insert the needle and draw out the air .you can push the pump to create the pressure necessary for printing .
and i 'm going to talk to you a little bit today about how to understand poker .understanding poker really starts off with the basic premise of knowing what the hand rankings are .you have anywhere from a high card which is the ace and actually a lot of people do n't necessarily know this , but the ace of spades is actually the highest card in the deck .it actually would trump any other ace that is in the deck .the spade being the highest ranking suit .to understand poker , you need to understand the value of all the cards .an ace can actually be used as a high card but if you were trying to make a straight which is 5 cards in sequential order , not of the same suit , you can actually use an ace as a one instead of as a high card .as you go along , you need to understand that obviously a ten is better than a two so understanding some of the basic premises of just your basic math and counting that certain cards are going to be of higher value than others .after a ten , the jack would be the next highest card , that 's the one with a j on it .the next would be a queen and that has a q on it .the next card after that is a king which has a k.some people actually when they 're playing poker and they have two kings , they call those cowboys .so the rankings go from high card to a pair which is where you have two cards of the game number.

ok.to center something like this on the wheel one of our concerns is going to be how tall it is .we do n't want it to fall over .so , often times while we want to work very slowly and turn the wheel on very slowly and also place a finger on the top section up here .just to hold it in place while we work .now , what we 're going to do to center is take this pin tool here .i 'm going to simply take it and put it up against the edge of my pot .you can see there , how it 's drawing a line in the part that 's not centered .now , i 'm going to find the beginning point of this line and the end point of this line over here .put it in front of me .simply push the whole pot forward slightly on the wheel , ok , like that .then i 'm going to recheck it .ok.as you can see there , we 're pretty much drawing a circle all the way around the base of the pot .now , the more off centered this would be you would have a smaller line .the more on centered it is the larger your line is going to be .until , of course , it circles the entire pot like this .ok.so , now we have the pot on the wheel .the next thing we want to do is secure it .i 'm just going to put some moisture down on the bat , as we talked about before .in order for the clay to stick you want some moisture on there .so , here we go .put some moisture down there .now , we 're going to want to take some clay , break off a lump .for this it 's a larger pot , so i 'm going to use larger pieces of clay to secure it .i 'm simply going to put this clay on the edge , being careful not to push into the clay , into the pot .i 'm going to push the clay down onto the bat ; like so , and secure it against the edge of the pot without moving the pot .now , i 'm going to do this again ; again , holding the top of the pot to secure it while we 're doing this .one last time ; i like to use three points of grip .as you can see we have sturdied this piece of work up here so that we can now start working on the top section .so , next we are going to be trimming this pot .i will be talking about that in the next section of this lesson .
so upon of rising i come into my bathroom.

ok , so as we step up in difficulty in fives , we move into another combination five , called the over under .also known as the top gun .now , the top gun , you may remember from the late eighties was huge .it was very similar to the cabbage patch .it came out with fire , disappeared , but yet nobody forgets .everybody remembers the top gun , the need for speed .the difficulty level in the top gun comes from the high five , the common high five , dropped down to the low five .you have to be high low , and then low high .to get the proper percussion on the top gun , on the over under .you have to be in sync with your partner .this is one of those high fives that you do n't want to commit to it unless it is somebody you 've been fiving with for a long time .like good and maverick .thank you buddy .or somebody you really hit it off with right away .you feel that cosmic connection in the five .this is one of my favorite fives because of that very reason .the top gun .
welcome back .jayne entwistle : we 're playing some of our favorite improv games and now we 're going to play a very famous , popular game called freeze tag .how this game works is people are doing action on stage -- it could be one person , it could be two people , it could be many people .somebody calls `` freeze '' and what they do is they tap out the person that they want to replace , and then they take their exact spot .okay , this works on a few skills .first of all , it works on really paying attention and trying to recreate what 's going on ; also , sort of the quickness of allowing your improv mind to take over without judging or critiquing yourself .so we 're going to do a little -- give you a few examples of how freeze tag works .for this , andrew , why do n't we -- we 'll be on a ship .andrew stubblefield :okay .jayne entwistle :okay ?and we 'll just sort of give you some example .normally , we would have a scene partner that we 're playing with , but we 'll just give you some examples .andrew stubblefield : and also , each one of these scenes can generate and create a completely different new scene .it has nothing to do with the scene before .i mean , it can , but it does n't have to .jayne entwistle :right .all right , so -- andrew stubblefield.

hey guys , in today 's topic we 're going to talk about how a dj mixer works .let 's take a look at this .in your basic dj mixer you usually got two channels , left and right .and those are really basically your left and right sources , in this case two turntables .and then you 've a selector switch for your cue , or for your headphones .that 's going to cue your headphones from left to right .and basically what happens all throughout the night as you 're djing , is the dj is basically one step ahead of the crowd , and basically in the headphones cuing up the next song , before he actually brings it in , and turns the volume up for the crowd to hear .let 's get familiar with the parts of a dj mixer .in any dj mixer you 're going to have a gain , which is to say the volume coming into the mixer from the turntables .you 're also going to have a section of equalizer , low frequency , mid-frequency , and high frequency .and then you 're going to have a volume fader which controls the volume that goes out to the house , and the house is basically what everybody else is listening to .is also on most dj mixers got , a basic cross-fader which fades back and forth between the left sound source and the right sound source .and you 've got a master volume , and that master volume is your volume for the house .that 's a basic dj mixer .
ok , our first step in our bedroom project is going to be addressing the ceiling .its fairly common in an old place like this for you to get a lot of cracks .essentially what 's happening is the plaster is separated from the material underneath it.
the linear selection makes a smooth movement between keyframes but in a more linear fashion without the excess movement .the constant selection limits the animation to just each frame of motion .so , you 'll notice that when i select this , there is no movement whatsoever between keyframes ; it stops at one motion .so , what we 're going to do first of all is to select all the keyframes at the end of the walk , and we 're going to break that by having our figure stop completely .and now , as we scrub through the timeline , you 'll see that he walks and comes to a complete stop with no additional movement .
in this clip we 're going to talk about , how to project your singing voice .i have to say , this is a big subject .i would encourage you , if you really want to finesse this and really get it going to get some lessons .but in this clip , i can talk about a number of different things that will help you get started .one of which is , you want to sing with a relaxed open throat , that 's very important .if you close off , and a lot of beginning singers go , ( i 'm exaggerating ) but they sing with a lot of tension here , they 're nervous , they want to make sure they get the sound right , and that 's going to shut down the sound , it 's going to shorten it , limit it , shrink it , and it 's not going to be nearly as effective .you want to open everything up , you want to make sure the jaw is relaxed in the back , your throat is open as well .a great way to find what that feels like , is to force yourself to yawn , and when you yawn , everything goes , ahh , like that .so when you 're projecting your voice , you want to start from that thought .another thing that you want to think about , a friend of mine told me , that it 's almost like , controlled bellowing.
next we 're going to learn the d minor scale .we 're only going to play the d minor scale in one octave .earlier we learned the d major scale .and a little later we 're going to learn the d minor arpeggio to go along with the d major arpeggio that we learned earlier .so this is the d minor scale .and now we are going to go down on the d minor scale .and you should be able to hear , it sounds slightly different from the d major scale .it has a slightly darker sound and this is mostly because you are playing in f natural as opposed to an f sharp , which you were playing earlier in the d major scale .and a little bit later we 're going to learn the d minor arpeggio to go along with the d minor scale that we just learned .
ok , floor bow .this pose happens in most beginning yoga classes , even though i personally believe that it is beyond the ability of most beginners .i 'm going to see if i can teach you how to do it safely and effectively and to work your way into it so that you do n't hurt yourself .floor bow is a back bend , you start on your belly .in this pose we 're going to grasp the ankles and the idea is to kick the feet back into the hands , lift the heart and rise into a bow shape .problem is , is that that 's nearly impossible for somebody who sits at a desk eight hours a day or more .this is the way i like to work into it .i like to bring one arm down to the floor.
now right now we 're going to talk about the drinks .if you serve your drinks in these fun little champagne type glasses your guests are sure to feel like the stars that they are .you can serve anything that you think your guests will enjoy from wine or champagne or just soda or sparkling cider , and even have some water on hand for those who may be , might be a little more on the boring side or healthy side , and just make sure that you do have a champagne glass for everyone on hand at the party , and enough champagne or sparkling cider for everyone to toast at the end of the awards show .you can also toast to the best picture once that 's announced and toast to you that you 're a great host and just toast the end of a great party , and just make sure that you have , if you 've had your guests rsvp that gives you a good head count of how much , how many cups and how many drinks you should have on hand , and if you do n't get any rsvp 's back just , you know , try calling your friends and see if they 're planning on coming because you do n't want to have a lot of left over things after your party .but if you do happen to have leftovers.
another thing that can be very important when we 're talking about giving criticism is asking for cooperation .and what i mean by this is saying to the person , hey , i 've got some pointers that i really want to give you .i see some real flaws here .i see some mistakes that could be deadly here .will you work with me.
let 's understand the scrubbing process technically .scrubbing is an exfoliation process which removes the dead cells from the skin so that our skin breaths openly .in an acne prone skin , scrubbing process should ideally be avoided .we would now apply a little amount of mineral glow scrub .scrubbing has always been an important activity as a process of the facial .the scrub should be massage on the client 's face for about two minutes .we would be explaining the massage steps in the individual process of the facial in detail .we would this again from the client 's face .
chill to the bone is a powerful uncommon card out from coldsnap .it is an instant which means you can play it during and between phases of the game or at any phase of the game as long as you have the mana open .chill to the bone costs you 3 and a black which means its converted mana cost is 4 and.
i 've been keeping reptiles and amphibians for over forty years .and we 're here to talk about cleaning an iguana 's cage .if it 's a small aquarium , which you can start off with as a juvenile , it 's not difficult to just change out the bedding .you could use something like cypress mulch , which is not affected by a lot of misting and humidity , which is good for the iguana .and you can spot clean that .or you could even go something as simple as newspaper and just throw that away , and lay the new bed of newspaper down .you do n't need a lot on the floor of an iguana cage , because they 're arboreal , they spend most of their time up in the trees on branches .so you can put something very simple on the floor to allow you to clean it .now if you 're cleaning an outdoor cage , the main thing is to make sure the iguana ca n't get out while you 're cleaning .so hopefully , your outdoor cage is big enough for you to step into the cage , close the door behind you and then clean .
this is the basics of massage etiquette , sensitivity to the client 's mood regarding menstruation .obviously , this is an issue that applies to female clients .many experienced therapists know that it 's common for a female client to cancel a therapy session if they 're menstruating .one of the things that you can do to be sensitive to this is reassure the client that you 're prepared for the situation through any of the different.

the trick i am going to be walking you through now is the basic lip slide on the down slope rail .this trick varies a little bit in that you come from the other side of the rail and you swing your tails over as opposed to swinging your noses over.
and one important thing we want our centers to understand is not only to be moving within the offense , always flashing to the ball , making themselves available in the offense , but also one thing we want our centers to understand is , they have to know where the ball is at all times .we ca n't have a center that goes to sleep on us down in the post , and just says.
we 're going to present tadasana , mountain pose with the option of a chair .we 're going to start tadasana with the same alignment cues as any other time .you start with the soles of your feet aligning all the joints .so that if we have the inability to stand , you 're going to come and find yourself a chair , you 're still going to present your feet in tadasana .if you have shorter legs , then , for example jennifer , you might need to find yourself some blocks or possibly some books or something that you might have in your own home , so that you can lift and look at the alignment from the ankles to the knees , and then the knees to the hips , creating proper alignment .if i am not using the blocks , my knees , i start to angle down .we 're going to talk about from the hips to the shoulders , creates the length .lifting the head away from your shoulders , and allowing the shoulder blades , scapulus to glide down the spine .so the alignment is no different then when you are standing .we have a nice line from the ankle to the knee , knee to the hip , hip to the shoulders , out the crown of her head .she 's going to make an effort to lift the collar bone up towards her chin and as always an effort to create space in your spine .staying in tadasana for as long as it 's comfortable , with the thought of , `` where is there discomfort ?where do i need to make some adjustments '' ?and enjoy .
a great variation of the noseblunt slide , is the noseblunt side , the fakie .basically , what you 're doing is , what you 've ollied into the noseblunt slide ontop of the ledge , instead of popping out and rolling away forward , like you did with the noseblunt slide , you 'll want to pop out , one eighty , or ninety degrees the other way , and land fakie and roll away switch .this is another great variation that you can learn while doing noseblunt slides .one way to learn this , would be to do what you did with the noseblunt slide , and set up the board , and test popping out in the fakie position .from a stall , and practice popping out .the foot positioning that you 're going to need for the noseblunt slide , the fakie , is very similar to the pop out forward .the only difference is , you 're going to be guiding your shoulders just slightly differently to get you into a switch landing .now , this trick is harder to pop out in the middle of a ledge , it 's easier to come off the end of a ledge .but , you want to be able to learn it in the middle , because it 's a little harder to do in the middle .so if you learn it this way , you 'll be able to bring this trick to just about any spot , or any ledge .and that 's how you do a frontside noseblunt slide , the fakie .
now , i 'm going to show you how to make a curious comfort .this drink is going to be made in a highball glass .so first off , we 're going to fill the glass , right to the top , with ice .next , we 're going to add our liquors .in this drink , the two liquors are southern comfort , which is why it 's called a curious comfort .anytime you have the word comfort , you 're always going to use southern comfort , or soco .so , we 're going to add 3 , 3/4 of an ounce of southern comfort , and next , we 're going to add 3/4 of an ounce of blue curacao .then , we 're going to add our mixer , which for this drink is pineapple juice .and , we are going to mix it .so , i 'll just add it to my shaker .i 'm going to want to shake it up .and , you want to make sure there 's condensation on the side of the shaker.
alright ,now in making this wine , we 've got the fruit all busted up and inside your container that you 're going to let it digest in .now we have taken about , in making your mind ,wine , you want to take about a third of the fruit.

so , here in head balance spine is upside down balancing .rising up through the seat .rising up through the feet .head is rooting down .you 're going to come from this pose back to hero pose .turn everything topsy-turvy .bang .and , i feel it 's important to take this pose after head balance .because , it tells you what you actually did .hard to believe that in head balance the experience is of elongation of weightlessness of lightness .and , people tell you that.
today we 're going to talk about trimming your goat 's hooves .now , it 's a gnarly and dangerous job , but it 's an important one , nonetheless .the winter is really tough on goat 's feet , and they tend to crack and split , and the manure and the mud gets rammed up into the hoof .and so , regular maintenance of the goat 's hooves is important .these goats have been a little bit neglected , but we 'll do our best to bring the hoof back into shape , and then continue through the spring to trim it back .let me show you how it 's done .okay .the goat is contained in this stance , and so i have full access to the goat 's hoof .and what i 'm trying to do is create a flat plane which corresponds to this hairline here .so i 'm trying to reproduce this hairline along this surface .you can see , there 's broken hoof here , we want to trim that off .and we want to take out the tip .easy , boy .fight .no , baby .hang in there .it has to be done , so , may as well do it .this is called the frog , we want to trim that back as well , to a flat surface here , and you want to recreate that flat surface as best we can .you see there 's dead tissue , there 's mud.
all right , now we 're going to go ahead , and make our rice , so we 're going to turn on our front burner , to about six , and then we 're going to put in about a tablespoon of oil , and we 're going to move that around , so it coats the bottom of the pan.

if it 's coming for your married life , that means that there can be a fight in your married life , everything 's going smooth and all of a sudden you get into a dispute and aros is but warfares .at the same time if it 's coming for your finances , there can be some kind of agression which leads to a no .there can be problems because you are going to be fighting and fighting your odd , the finances just too important.
now one neat little trick that i use sometimes , especially when i 'm printing with a fiber based paper , are the times in which i develop my print at .now there are different times for rc paper and for fiber paper .that 's one way that the fiber based paper is a little bit slower to work with .but i sort of like it because i can develop my fiber based paper anywhere from two to five minutes .and therefore i can sort of manipulate the way that print looks .i can manipulate it much easier than i can manipulate my rc print .and another thing that i can do with the fiber based paper , is i can use two developers .i can use a dectol and a selectol .the dectol 's are a cold , contrasty developer , and the selectol 's a very warm developer .so in a way , i 'm getting the best of both worlds using those two different developers .now it is more expensive to use two different developers , but sometimes price is definitely worth what your final outcome of your print is .
after this point , we 're going to have to put it in the refrigerator and let it sit for at least one hour .a good idea is to go ahead and cook this ahead of time the day before so it can be sitting over night , so it 'll have time to sit and rest because we do n't want the mix to go straight from the mixer to the cookie tray .it wo n't turn out good cookies .they wo n't stick together .at this point , it 's letting all the flavors mix in and set .like any other meal you do , the longer it sets , the better it is .think of this as slow roasting for a cookie .
alright when closing down a pool.
so as i 'm working with all the colors ; the black , white , and the brown , the orange , i 'm wanting to create this effect of fur , so i want all the colors to start to blend in with each other .so i 'm using this old brush .and as i start to create the brush strokes of the tigers markings , then the black gets merged in with the brown and the orange and the white , more of a three dimensional effect of the fur .
today i 'm going to tell you about a game that you and two of your friends can play , so that one of you does n't have to sit out while the other one plays , such as you would have to do in eight ball .the name of the game is cut throat .and what you do is one person will break the balls .one , the person who breaks the balls has one through five .the person who shoots second has six through ten .and the person who shoots third has eleven through fifteen .the object of the game is to get your playing partners balls off of the table and have at least one of yours left .you can shoot any ball .you can shoot your ball into the hole to get a better shot on somebody else 's ball .you continue shooting until you miss .when that has happened , then the next man comes up to the table and he starts to shoot .so the whole purpose is to try to get your friends balls off the table before yours are .
backstroke is basically the upside down version of your freestyle stroke .the only difference or the primary difference is that you 're allowed to breath as often and as regular as you like , so it makes it almost more comfortable for swimmers .the first thing you 're going to want to do is learn how to float on your back by simply placing your head back , your chin up in the air , putting your belly button up and just letting your body float naturally .take breaths in nice and easy .a tendency that people have is that they stop breathing .basically they just fill themselves up afraid to allow any water in their mouths or in their nose .but please , keep on breathing whenever you 're floating on your back .the next phase is just incorporating your straight leg , pointed toe kick .you 're just going to keep your hips up on top of the water with your pelvic bone up at the top.
the first place i think of going is to music .a lot of artists i know do work to music.
next we continue with using our elbows as a punch .so to do that we have a nice stable base of either a a stance or a sumo stance .toes are out , lots of flexibility , mobility through the base of the body .bringing it into the core right here .and then what you simply do is you have an open hand and a fist .and you punch that elbow out , bring it back to center , punch , center , punch , center , punch , center .we will try the other side by opening the other hand , fist on the other side .punch , like nudging it with your elbow , punch , elbow punch , punch , punch , pop .you can do it one side and the other , pop , pop , to play with the agility , the ability to change quickly , precisely .elbow punch .
we are going to go over the last basic measurement on how to , on the measurements to have a custom dress made .the last measurement is the arm circumference .and we want to take this to make sure , especially if you 're having a poofy sleeve or , or even just a basic sleeve that we get a sleeve that , that fits your arm .and is n't too big or too tight .if it is too tight around your arm , you 're not going to be able to move .so the best thing to do is just to , to take your soft measuring tape that you 've been using , and go around the upper part of your tricep , and do n't pull it too tight .make sure it 's just snug .and line up the end with the front like we 've been doing .and this will give you the proper measurements .one other thing that you can do too , is go ahead and measure from where the top of the shoulder is down to see exactly how long you want the sleeve and then take the measurement from that point and go around .
i 'm.
and we can see that there are several turrets in here .so one thing that we can do to get rid of them instead of rushing them with a block because there 's too many of them , we can place a portal under the different turrets and let them fall through , or we can place one behind and walk up and grab it like we 've been doing .and the turrets come through the portals just like any other object so you can reach in and grab one and then pull it and take it somewhere else .we 've got a couple of more to deal with here .so we can maybe place a portal above that one and drop a block on it , if we can aim that .go ahead and knock that one down , and that clears this room from turrets .we can pick up the box , put it on the pressure plate , and it looks like it 's not quite the exit yet .we 've got a couple more turrets to deal with , but there 's this wire mesh here that i ca n't walk through .luckily , you can shoot a portal through the wire mesh and you can put the entrance just anywhere.
until our strands of cheese are all melted .we can take that and place it right here in the back .then we are going to come back into the oven and grab our vegetables .you can see that the cheese has just started to get a little brown .squeeze our entire vegetable thing straight into the back .then we are going to come back to our pork .i 'm going to pull our pork off and lay that over the front .then we are going to stir our veggies up here to the front .make sure we get a nice blend of the bacon , the tomatoes , the onions , and the jalapenos .spread that over the top .then we 'll take a little scoop of our cream sauce , take our scallions , place those over the front .here we have our asparagus , caramelized onions , red peppers , basil and reggiano cheese , our green chili , cheddar mashed potatoes , and our tomato , bacon , lime , jalapeno , pork chop .
a lot of the principles work both whether you 're in a bar or in a church .one of the important things , not only listening or playing less , less is more , but is let the music breathe .do n't be afraid to have some spaces in the song .a lot of times , if i 'm playing for instance , this song , `` enough '' , i may be playing something light on the strings -- or maybe the next verse , i just stop playing .i let the guitars carry it .a lot of times , it 's nice to start a chorus with just a guitar or one instrument .maybe you 're the one instrument playing but do n't be afraid to stop playing .you do n't have to play every chorus , every verse , every note .let the music breathe .put some space in there .or maybe what you do is just come in at the beginning of a phrase .for example , if i 've got -- especially with some of the sounds that ring .if i wanted to play `` enough '' with a bell , i might just do this or something like that .in other words , at the beginning of the phrase , play something and then just let it ring.
now that we have got our clay up there and we are ready to roll.
so , let 's find the flour , ok.i pour it in into the bowl , ok , and then we need about two hundred grams of sugar , but you can actually put less or more , depending on your taste .that 's a bit too much ; put some back , that will do it .i pour it together with the flour .now i 'm going to put some baking soda in it .well , i use about one coffee spoon of baking soda , ok , and a tiny little bit of salt , some cinnamon .i mean , you can provide those spices according to your taste .we love cinnamon , so i put quite a lot in it .then i 'm also going to put some mixture that is especially made for gingerbread men .i put in about two spoonful of this mixture , ok.maybe i can put a little bit of chocolate , dry chocolate , just to give a little hint of chocolate taste , okay .
the next step wants you to take a look and see at the design element .one of the things that you need to do is , on this one , is carry these , the blue color a little further out .we have the dimensions to do that .we can add that by a simple flower , or small filler that does n't really take away from the cow lilly , but it adds a little dimension to it and it takes your eye out .and we can do that on both sides , so that you 'll follow all the way through .the next , the other thing you need to do at this point , is lift it up .and again , i use a hot glue gun .and start to glue in , now you can hold it anywhere and see where it is , and hold in any of those pieces that hand downward , just run the glue in there until they stay in place .it 's very important because this might be an arrangement that you are going to be taking on and off the table and you do n't want it to be falling apart every time you go to pick it up .so the next piece , the next step in making an arrangement is making sure that your design elements work .if they need something , go ahead and make that adjustment to them .and then go ahead and glue everything in space .
and we 're just going to do a few little cross-hatches down at the bottom , and then we 're going to add some glue .we are very carefully going to go around our mushroom stem .and this grass is optional .you do n't have to do this .the mushroom will look fine without it .i think it 's a nice touch .and you can take some of the pieces and you can curl them forward , twist them around , make them a little interesting .
okay , so you went under three that first time , but you may have to do that when you get to the beginning , but then you go back to your two .so you keep going around and around here .hopefully things are pretty clear now .you do n't want to over-tighten at this point , because it 's going to be hard to check the sound , because you ...this ...
hey my name is addison from captain bills.
today , we 're here to talk about selecting goggles for skiing or snowboarding .i think goggles are much more appropriate than sunglasses for these activities .they 're protect your eyes from glare off of the snow , coming from the bottom up .they also protect against wind , which sunglasses do n't do that well .and also , actually , if you fall on your face , the goggles ' a little more protective than sunglasses .when you 're looking at goggles , you 'll see some basic models here , that just have a wrap around lens like this .this is a double lens , they 're actually two lenses , like a thermal window , and that keeps fog out from happening .there is also an anti-fog bonded to the lens , and any of your more popular brands of goggles will have all those features .then when you step up into a more higher end model , you 'll see there 's a spherical curve to the lens , which gives you less peripheral , visual distortion , truer looks , or truer views there .and , there are different lenses available , any thing from a clear , which would be used for night riding or very darker times in the evenings .or , it for , the most near darkest , for the brightest days out there .there 's also junior models available .these are obviously smaller , still have all the same features , and what you 're going to look for when you 're actually trying goggles on , is something that just fits well , all around your face , no gaps around your nose , or anywhere else .and they do come in some different shapes , so trying on goggles is the best way to go .when you 're wearing these with a helmet , pretty much all helmets have some form of a goggle strap retaining device here , and that 's just.

alright , so where the cheeks come into the rest of the face , usually as people get older there is a line that is going to go kind of from the nose down around the mouth .our reference is young but as he gets older , there is going to be a more defined shadow that is going to appear here .the more shadows you add to a face , the younger it looks , because usually those defined wrinkles in the skin where the light is being captured .that is kind of where shadows are coming from .in this reference , it is all very smooth .there are not that many wrinkles , that many places where shadows are being created .so , let us back at the face .it looks pretty smooth .got shadows going on here .this one is actually a little too much for our reference , he makes him look older than he is.
alright , now i want to talk about one other thing about your greeting .as far as your speaking voice , same principals to all other business conversations ; be professional , do n't speak to fast ; have a smile in your voice , be positive and helpful ; articulate so that people can understand you .another thing that you want to do is make sure you leave your , you make your greeting current .if you , if you 're out a lot ; if you have different instructions for your callers a lot , make sure you change that greeting a lot .the worst thing for me to do today , march 18th is to call up and your greeting says `` hello , this is tracy goodwin today.
in this segment , we re going to talk about the parts of the piano .in front of me are the keys all types of keys white keys and black keys .down here we have the low keys .these are low notes -- so it s down the keyboard .all the way up here we ve got the high notes making high sounds , high tones .these are the high notes and of course the notes in the middle .as you can see , there are white keys and there are black keys .now , how does a piano work ?if i open the lid of the piano , you ll see that each one of these keys attaches to a string.
this is a power race.
hi , i 'm james , with j & c home repair .today i 'm going to show you how to buy a rotary tool as a gift .really , there 's really no difference between rotary tools.
you 're going to want to keep some supplies on hand until , until right , you know , when you 're leaving the house until everything has been taken out of your house .we already talked about keeping your toolbox readily available , and , and also your cleaning supplies , you want to keep those readily available .some other good supplies to keep available are tape , and your , your marker , some plastic bags , any kind of rope that you 're going to be using , that you have maybe to pack things in the truck .any kind of moving pads , furniture pads , towels , blankets that you might want to use for padding things that your packing into the truck .so these are things that you , you 're just want to , you 're going to want to keep out until you  re ready to leave the old place.
we 'll make this a happy birthday !and i 'm going to add a little bit more of the stickers to really decorate the card nicely .the sticker collections now a days are so fancy .you do n't have to have really any artistic ability except to know what you like .and you can see you put together a very fancy card .and you can personalize it any way you like .i 'll add a few more things here .never be afraid to cut up the stickers and make them do what you want them to do .it 's nice to secure the pop up cards with a little bit of double stick tape or a dab of glue , just on the corners here .just to hold that together .and just stick that down on the corners .and there 's our super easy pop up card .you have a nice pop up like that.
so we 're going to add an entire pound of cream cheese .and you want to make sure that both the butter and cream cheese have been taken out well in advance so that they are nice and soft and easy to beat together .this is going to be a really fast frosting to make provided that all the ingredients are ready .as soon as we get this cream cheese in here , then we 'll be ready to start beating it .of course , if you let things get too soft , then they do n't want to come out their packaging .so , with the cream cheese and softened butter in the mixer , we 're going to start it on a slower speed .and then we 're going to increase the speed up to a much faster speed so they can both be fully incorporated and creamed before we go on to our next step .
so whatever you have on your hair already , you have to take into consideration , whether it 's your natural color or whether it 's color that you put on previously , and you have to take that into consideration always when choosing your next hair color .on this mannequin , we 've got some highlighted pieces , and then we 've got some colored pieces .so if i was to apply let 's say a red color all over , i would have to take into consideration this blonde hair .this blonde hair may very well turn pink .so in order for me to make this a nice red , i would have to apply something else over it before applying the final color .in the next few segments we 're going to be talking about how to choose those colors and how to properly do that .
today i 'm going to show you how to replace your chain rings .first step is to remove the crank set from your bike .this requires a special tool which if you do n't have this tool you need to take it in to your local bike shop and have them remove it for you .once you get it to this point where it 's off of the bike you can then proceed with removing the chain rings .most chain rings are held together with chain ring bolts .there 's either four or five of them .they usually , typically have a 5 millimeter or a 6 millimeter allen screw in them .so you just need an allen wrench to remove them .start with , on this particular case , the triple .you can start with the inner ring .i 'm just going to loosen these screws all the way around the outside .now that you have your inner ring removed you can proceed with removing the outer and the middle rings which are held together with a two sided bolt .usually you can get them off with just one side .same process .just loosen them .and on these ones you have to hold the back of them to unscrew the two pieces .and they 'll come apart in two halves .now that you have all of those out both rings should be free from the spider and you can then replace whichever ring needs to be replaced .to reinstall them.
alright , now we 're mixing it up even more , for you .so now what we 're going to do , is we 're going to be doing the one.
a single thread would be like this you just have one thread , which on a more delicate piece you 'd probably want to use a single thread .but since this is a work shirt we 're not going to worry about that .we 're going to tie a knot at the end .and again you 're going to place the button face up because it does have a different look .this is the front of the button , this is the back of the button.
the stretch that we 're going to be performing is called our butterfly stretch .this is going to be a seated stretch .`` now go ahead and have a seat on the floor melissa '' .very good .now this stretch is going to be working your inner thighs , as well as loosening up the ligaments and tendons in your joints and ankles .so to perform this , melissa is going to go ahead and bring her legs out and bring both of your feet together .now in this position , right , you want to put your feet nice and close to your body .now , you want to make sure to bring your mind right , to make sure you choose your toes , your pushing together this way .and what this does , this allows you to open up your hip joints a little more .you want to maintain a very straight posture throughout your back and now as you 're pushing here , you want to make sure to breathe in and breathe out .every time you exhale you want to feel your thighs , right , relaxing and pressing down with little bit more .now you 'll see some people do this stretch and they allow their legs to come up and down very fast .okay .we do n't want to really do this in the beginning , as just beginning with your stretches .you want to work your stretches very slow and very smoothly .you do n't want any jerking or any fast movements .it 's very easy to pull a tendons or joints , so you want to make sure just to move nice and easy through the stretch .to increase it , you can keep your feet where they are and lean more forward from your lower back , this way , right .and you 'll feel the stretch more throughout your lower back and more spreading through the upper hip , the upper thigh and outer thigh as well .this is our butterfly stretch , kung fu for health .
and now that we have a little bit more of a basic understanding of how the paddle wheel was designed , and how you might be able to make one yourself , let 's talk now about how to attach the paddle wheel to the canoe .you do n't want to just lay it on top of the canoe here , because it 'll slide back and forth , so we have to attach it to what we call the gunnels .the gunnels are these black pieces of plastic running along the top of the canoe frame here , and when adjusting the paddle wheel to your canoe , you want to take in a few things for consideration .first is most people that use the adaptive paddle wheel also use the adaptive seating , so you want to put the paddle wheel in a respective place of the person in the chair , meaning you do n't want to put the paddle wheel way out in front of em 'so they 're leaning over , trying to paddle ; straining their back .you want to put it in a comfortable area for them .and you also want to make sure ; just give it a good eye and make sure that the paddle wheel goes straight across the canoe , because if it 's off to the side you 'll just wind up paddling in circles all day , which is n't necessarily fun .the best way this paddle wheel connects to the canoe is it has some clamps here , and this clamp just goes underneath the gunnel , and you 'll hold it in place , and then it 's fastened down just by tightening this screw .and so , you 'll tighten it down like so , and you 'll do it to both sides , and once we have both sides set up.
now here we have syvarris , our hero , who has a range of nine and our little knight guy .now , severus , as we see right here , has a clear line of sight through these evergreen trees at the back of the soldier .now , once again , this line of sight is clearly seen and clearly visible because , once again , line of sight is very important because the rules state that you can not see through and or shoot through these evergreen trees .now , on the other hand if syvarris was over here behind these two trees .there is actually a narrow.
and it 's walk the dog .walk the dog looks like this .from a strong sleeper .you touch it to the ground and let it run .i 'll try that again so we can get the full view .it runs right across the ground like so .it works a little bit better on a hard floor .on the carpet it slows it down a little bit .try this on a hard floor , somewhere that the yo-yo is going to slide a little bit more as it 's running .to do walk the dog.
alright , every lacrosse game starts with a draw .you also do a draw after someone scored a point to resume the game and you do it in the beginning of the half too .so , basically , what it is , is it 's two players who turn their sticks with the backs towards each other with the ball in the middle.
the important thing is to make sure that this sit is not reused and doing that we want you to cut out the hardness straps .if your getting the same sit.
so especially if you have just done your leg lifts or any other light kind of abdominal exercise you are going to want to reverse that and just sort of disperse some of the heat in your abs .this is fish pose .you do it and you are going to come down to sitting and then extend the legs in front of you , come back on to your elbows and you are going to gently let your head fall back as you lift the heart.
alright now we 're going to talk about word placement .sometimes you might want to use one word in particular , and the word might not be enough syllables or it might just not be a proper word , so you want to find an alternative word to use in that place .sometimes the word `` see '' would no be as big as `` observation '' .like : `` it was hard for me to 'see ' '' ,but you might you might want to be like :`` it was hard for me to me to make an 'observation ' , with all the constant hating , across the nation , but i 'm embracing , the situations , that i be facing .i 'd have had a whole different rhyme pattern if i 'd have just said , `` it 's hard for me to see '' or `` be a g '' .anyway , it kind of goes back to compound syllables .sometimes you want to even look into other words and more complex words for the fact of not making your record sound as ignorant , or make your record sound.
okay , what happens at this point after we 've taken this brief walk down memory lane , is the presentation of the gift .now do n't panic .a gift -- you 're thinking , oh my gosh , fiftieth wedding anniversary , fortieth wedding anniversary.
well , the first thing we do , every donor that comes in to donate is actually , the test process starts that day .believe it or not , a lot of people do n't think of it that way .but , we prick every donor 's finger to check their iron level .and we do that either through a hemoglobin test or hematocrit test , different places do different things .so , we do that test that day , that lets us know if for that day if your iron is high enough for you to donate blood .now , obviously , we 're not going to take your blood if it 's going to affect you negatively that day or in a negative way that day .so , we want to make sure you 've got enough iron to be good when you leave plus to be able to give us a pint , to help somebody in the hospital that actually needs it .so , we do that test that day .there are standard tests we do to every unit of blood to every donor .no matter if you donate one time or six hundred times .you have the same tests going on every time .that way it 's standard across the board .we make sure that every unit is as safe as it can be here at the american red cross .so , we do that , you know , some of the reasons are donors are differed ,you know it can be reasons such as travel , hepatitis.
and as you do this you are going to slide up , pick the leg up and do a round kick to the mid section or to the face .here is one slow , and here is one a little faster .the way it works with an opponent is as they throw their back fist.
in the medical history interview , some things come up that will prevent people from being able to donate blood .we call it a deferral .the most common reason people are deferred from donating is , hemoglobin for women especially .we have a requirement of twelve point five grams of hemoglobin for each whole blood donor .the reason being , is when you donate blood.
hello models , what we 're going to do now is pattern number five , and i want you to notice where i 'm going to be changing my clothes and wearing different types of wardrobe .right now , i 'm in my back-to-school wear , which it can be back-to-school wear for any age , it 's age-appropriate clothing .what i 'm going to do is show you pose one , two , and three , the catwalk , and a half turn , in my back-to-school wear .okay ladies , let 's hit pose number one , which is your basic .moving on to pose number two .and now we 're going to hit pose number three , and both hands are on the hip , notice that the fingers are relaxed and upward , and the elbows are pressing forward .i 'm going to walk down , do my half-turn .i step forward on the right foot , on the balls of my feet , walking back with another half-turn , ending in my basic which is pose one , off you go , ladies .now that the ladies have done pattern number five , which is back-to-school wear , we 're going to do it for the gentlemen .they 're also going to choose some wardrobe which is age-appropriate for back-to-school .
so the next exercise that we 'll work on is for legs and they 're for your abductors or as many people in the fitness industry call it the ab-ductors .a lot of people will call this a girl exercise , but guys need it as well .it helps give lateral support and overall it adds to conditioning for your body and stability and will be necessary in progressing to other exercises down the road .so like it or not go ahead have a seat and we 'll work on it .have a seat so that your pelvis will touch the back of the seat .make sure that your legs are out nice and long so that you do n't feel cramped .select a weight that is appropriate .bring your hands down by your side , hold onto the handles , exhale , pull your belly button in towards your spine and you open your knees and your feet out to the side .work smoothly and work as wide as you can .it 's very important to work with your abdominals tightening each time , it 'll add support to your obliques and also to the muscles that will work for stability in other exercises down the road .go for it !

you can not leave a child alone with pillows , stuffed animals , duvet covers , or blankets .a child can sometimes scoot their way onto something like a stuffed animal or a pillow , but then not actually be able to lift themselves up and off of it .there are numerous accounts of children actually suffocating on pillows that have been placed around them in order to keep them from rolling off a bed .these are very , very serious risks , and we really recommend that you not ever put any sort of stuffed animal , pillow , blanket , or anything like that into a crib with a child .blanket sleepers are the way to go when a baby is very young .obviously , they swaddle and they do n't move too much .again , just swaddle them .as they get older , you can use blanket sleepers .just be sure that you dress your baby warmly and avoid any sort of blankets that they can become entangled in or crawl under and not be able to come out from under .these are just things to keep in mind when you 're putting your baby to bed .

flourishing , this is an entire book written about the art of flourishing .flourishing is to my mind the icing on the cake .and it 's in itself a whole art form , as much as cake decorating is an entire art form unto itself .and they 're people in the field of calligraphy who specialize in this type of work .if you want to see some really dramatically , absolutely marvelous flourishing , check out the universal penman , look at these guys ; these things have to be designed , and then they 're executed to look as if they came straight out of the pen .ornamental pen designs and flourishes.

an additional octave that you can play is the e octave .i 'm playing the e on the d string , with the e on the a string together .and when you 're playing this octave , what you 're going to hear , what you should hear is actually a little bit of a ringing sound coming from the open e string .it 's very , very faint , so it may be hard to hear , but when you 're playing your harmonic you also heard a ringing , as well .so you 're looking for a similar type of ringing , and the ringing will let you know that you 're playing in tune .and you can adjust your fingers until you find the sound that you want .and once you 've found your sound , the two e 's , when you 're playing them together , will sound in unison , and it 's going to sound perfectly in tune .
other after market products that we see a lot of in the field.
today we 're cooking up some chili verde .alright , now we 've added our anaheims which we chopped up , and to the meat , we now want to do some chicken broth .just get your chicken broth , pour it on in .it 's real good .alright , take a look at this .this is what it 's going to be looking like .get our chicken broth here , stir it up .now i 've got two cans , i 'm going to add one more .that 's just not enough .so let 's chop it up , i mean open it up .alright , alright .alright , now we 're going to turn it up a little more , we 're going to let it sit right here .we 've added it , you can add if you want it thicker , do n't add as much .if you want it runny , add a bunch .alright , you can , one can can stretch it a little more .so just do what you want .play with it .add a little more flour if you want it to be a little thicker .just , i did n't add a lot .i did n't want just the taste of flour , but that does thicken .so that 's good .
okay , in this segment , we 're going to cover inspecting the brake system and that 's just the portion of the brake system directly applicable with the rear wheel .and what we want to do prior taking apart the brake system , we want to look it over thoroughly .check the brake hoses and make sure there 's dry rot , cracks or kinks in those .check the alignment and the routing of the manual parking brake cable .and a good visual inspection of the caliper assembly , the sliding and the pads themselves and.
and we got a stick and everyone from about 2 years on to about 25 poked at it.
and for your listeners as well , too , because everybody 's getting something out of this .one thing you 'll remember that works , as value added for your sales department , especially is using some of the clients for your station as guests , as a contact for the newsroom .next time there 's something like a snow storm on the way , why not get a client who sells tires on the air to tell you why you need this new set of tires and how to drive a bit more defensively in the winter time .this is great because it 'll give them a chance to feel like an expert , which they are , because they know the product more than you do .and you get that extra bang for the dollars that they 're spending with the radio station , hopefully come back and do some more spending because they 'll have a lot of people talking about that .you can use the clip on the news department , or on the next news cast .it 's a win-win situation all the way around .
how do you fight ?well , that is actually a very interesting question .to me , all fighting begins with a mindset .my mindset is that no one touches me without my permission .that is my guiding line .no one touches me without my permission .and , if you touch me without my permission , i am going to prevent you from doing that .that does not mean i am going to be able to beat you in a fight .it does not mean i am going to win every fight .but , i am always going to protect myself .i have a high sense of self worth .that being said , there is two types of fights .organized sport fighting where there are rules , a referee , and a goal .and then , there is street fighting .self defense where there are no rules , and there is no referee and it is not a place you want to be .let me discourage you from getting into any fight that is not an organized sport fight that you are preparing for with a coach .here is the key .when a self defense situation arises , a street fight situation arises , people talk about technique a lot .all self defense is mental .ninety percent mental , ten percent technique .the initial reaction of your body when it is threatened is fight or flight .that is the subconscious reaction .it is not a conscious reaction .you will feel probably hard to breathe .you will probably feel as though your arms and legs are suddenly very heavy and that your body releasing blood to your major muscles as you prepare to fight or flight .it is an adrenaline dump that , for someone who is not used to it , can be debilitated .so , regardless of the techniques you know , you will never get to fire those unless you learn to deal with the adrenal dump that precedes a self defense situation .you do that first by kind of putting yourself in situations where you are under some stress in a safe , organized manner , so that you get used to that adrenal dump .and then , the second thing we do is we control that by breathing .continuing to breathe .typically when you get tense and scared , fight or flight , you stop your breathing which exasperates the problem .key is to breathe .a martial arts master thinks about breathing with the entire diaphragm and the stomach out , pushing air all the way to the bottom of the lungs , not just this surface panting but strong deep breaths .and , in that scenario , the martial arts master , while there is chaos everywhere , the martial arts master maintains the quiet mind .and , that is how a martial arts master fights .so again , street fighting versus organized fighting .join a good martial arts school , a martial arts teachers ' association school and learn organized fighting .it is a lot more fun .it is a lot more safe and it makes more sense .i am john graden .i hope that helps .thanks !
so , what i 'm going to have you all do is can you step back lauren just a little step .sue stepping forward and walking you through uttanasana forward fold .so , bring your arms down to your sides .palms facing forward .standing nice and tall .crown the head , reaching towards the ceiling .beautiful .take a nice inhale .as you exhale , bring in the hands to heart center .inhaling , arms all the way up.
we 've already punched the holes using the 1/8 circle punch .i punched 2 in the top and 2 in the bottom .i just eye ball them .some people like to go ahead punch 2 in the top , fold this flap down , make a little mark with their marker .that way all your holes are lined up correctly .the next step is we 're going to take our ribbon .i like to use about a foot , 12 inches , because it 's easy to make a nice big bow .you 're going to start from the inside of the box .feed your ribbon out on both sides .if you take your ribbon and cut a little angle at the end.
so we are going to top off this eye look with some black mascara .so we are going to start on the bottom lashes .just do a wiggle , side to side motion .and on the upper lashes , we are going to roll on top , start at the base and wiggle our way up through .holding a little bit at the tip , allowing the polymers and mascara to dry and create some curl .so , again , we are going to do ; can you look up for me , do just a little side to side motion on the lower lashes , eliminate clumping .can you look down for me ?we are going to roll on the top , start at the base , wiggle our way up through , and hold for a second at the tip .so , that is how you would want to finish off your eye look using your black mascara .
okay , this is going to be the first example in 12-8 where we 're going to have consecutive notes on the bass drum .as we get faster , and you 'll see this when i play it in the shuffle version on the high hat , it can start to test the strength of your bass drum foot , but it does n't have to .these patterns sound just as good played slowly , so here it is .( plays )and here it is with the shuffle pattern .( plays ) so as you can see there 's a consecutive figure there on the bass drum .it happens to coincide with notes on the high hat .where it 's going to get more complicated is when we start putting notes on the bass drum and snare between the shuffle notes on the high hat , which we 'll get to later .
ok.now our next stage is we 're going to start rough shaping the head .it 's cutting everything that 's not indicated on here that that we do n't need .so we 're going to needle it .i will usually start at the top of the head , try and start rounding that off .right now i 'm using a hard exacto blade .if i want to speed things up i can heat my blade up , and it can cut a little easier .generally i 'm just rounding it off , just starting to create the shape of the head in a rounded form ; till i can get it down to the dimensions that are indicated in my drawing .when we 're finished this still wo n't be a head.
in your right hand place it between your index finger and middle finger and your thumb , because when you move your thumb away , yeah exactly .so show that they 're locked together and then on your last pull gently separate your thumb from the matchstick , pull the matchstick through like that .now , keep doing this until you 're really good at it , because if you accidentally knock it over here you ca n't recover .it 's happened a few times , so remember just keep at as close to your thumb as you can .in behind , there you go , back out , i just did it there .in , out , okay !when you do this trick a lot of times people think that you 're actually switching hands and switching matchsticks , there by giving you a lot more credits than is really necessary and that 's not necessarily a bad thing .
hi , i 'm emily larew .and to close up this last five , six , seven , eight , for our advanced hip-hop series .we 're going to do a slide to the floor and jump up to finish strong .ok ?so we have just finished doing a roll , three , four .your left hand is going to go to the floor .you 're going to push onto your left hip , slide through that opening .ok ?from there you 're going to bring your right foot forward .you 're going to stand up and jump out to finish strong on eight .alright ?let 's break that down again .it 's a lot of upper body strength and using the lower body at the same time so you do n't get stuck .three , four .we go five , push , six , seven , eight .good .let 's do it again , one more time .so we broke it down and you 're feeling good .we did one , two , three , four , we have five , six , seven , eight .good job .and that concludes our roll to the floor , slide to the floor and standing up .
if you want , it would be great .just a real low simmer through.
today , i thought we 'd talk about how to draw mouths .sounds like a mouse.
so we put them up on our back in the backyard and we put them up here on the garage .it is important for me that i don  t do something that looks like everybody else  s .for that reason and because we are kind of in a shaded area , i am going to do something with a little more foliage and a lot of other window boxes .i  ve chosen this boston fern here as a great center piece because it matches up so well.

alright we 're going to talk about why we soak the tamarind .it 's a dried fruit in this state.
in this step , we 're going to talk about the proper procedure for remounting your license plate and your last rear lamp .your license plate bracket is going to mount through the mounting holes for your lamp .as you can see , we have some studs here on the lamp , they 're going to go through and hold down the other side .our new kit came with a new license plate mounting bracket .as you can see , they 're identical .being that we already have one mounted to our plate , i 'm not going to install the new one , however , if you do n't have one , you going to want to remove the bolts here and here , reinstall your plate bracket like so , and then tighten the bolts down .you always want it to be stepping forward .as you can see , it 's stepping down and then forward , for your license plate , like so .that way your license plate illumination light will shine down onto your plate .and that 's the law ; your license plate has to be illuminated anytime you drive the trailer .i 'm just going to go ahead and spin off the mounting bolt .slide this through my license plate mounting bracket , like so , make sure not to pinch our wiring , and then mount it on the trailer .just like so .going to install a lock washer , and a retaining nut , spin them down finger tight , i 'm going to install the second lock washer and my second retaining nut .make sure not to pinch our wiring .i 'm going to take my quarter inch socket wrench with the ten millimeter socket .go ahead and snug those up , and there you go .from here , we 're going to g ahead and proceed connecting the wiring in the exact same fashion we did on the other side , with our heat shrink , water proof connectors and our terminal pliers .that is the proper way to remount your license plate bracket and your last rear mount lamp assembly .
all right , the drink we 're about to make is called a rum swizzle .go ahead and put some ice in a glass and measure out two ounces of light rum .you can use a dark rum here as well if you 'd like .and follow that up with the juice of one lime .and also one teaspoon of powdered sugar .and two dashes of bitters .and let 's go ahead and shake that up .make sure you get your powdered sugar dissolved really well in there .and we 've got a collins glass filled with ice , go ahead and pour that in .and we 're just going to top it off with some carbonated water .should get a nice swizzle .all right , quick mix , and we 'll give it a straw and that will be a big bottoms up .
i 'm at break time.
accessory 1 turns on your accessories , accessory 2 turns on your auxiliary accessories , accessory 3 will crank the car .once the car cranks and the ignition switch is released to the accessory 2 position , all the vehicle circuits stay on .of course when installing any electronic device such as a radio , automotive security system , remote car starter , you must duplicate what the ignition switch does .so in order for the remote starter to start the vehicle or a radio to come on , it must duplicate accessory 1 and accessory 2 .
when you 're working with animals you have a lot of options on the different poses that you can have them .some dogs are show dogs or whatever , so you definitely want to keep in mind doing the full length , full body shots to show off their shape and their form , and also their markings .but , it also can be great to go in for a close-up on their face , so that you can really see their personality .maybe get them looking when you squeak the toy , or maybe they have a certain trick that they do , that you can really zoom in close and get those details .also , props can be a lot of fun .i always have a whole box of props .some animals really like stuffed animals to play with .or maybe they want to play `` have the bone '' , which can also be great for a fun picture .some toys make noise .if you have a squeaker , that can work really well for both dogs and cats to get their attention and keep their energy up .something else that you can do to help control where the animal is is by setting a table up .probably not too high off the ground , but if you were to put a table up , in this case if you were to throw a white sheet over it , the dog would n't really be able to wander off , they 'd be stuck in that one spot , unless of course they jumped off the table .but this can be really good if you 've got a set setup with your lights and.
so , you learn how to breath , you learn how to warm up , you learn how to warm up your hips , you learn how to stretch , and now you are going to learn how to warm up your chest , you 're top .so , we 're going to make these circle movements .and remember that belly dance is about isolation , muscle isolation .you 're going to go ...only your chest is going to be moving , okay ?you 're going to go , front , side , back , side , front , side , back , side , front , side , back .and if you want to make sure that you 're going to isolate your upper body , you can open your legs and you can tighten your butt , like this to make sure that only your upper body is going to by moving ,okay ?so once again , side , front , side , back , side , front , side , back , side , front , side , back .and you can also warm up your arms with the snake arms .all this before you start.
a long extended brush duster is a great item to have for ceiling fans and lights and hard to reach areas .you still may need a little furniture polish to help collect the dust .beware of heated lights .as some dusters can melt on the lights .these extended dusters are great for cobwebs in corners , on walls , window sills and baseboards .cleaning chandeliers and light fixtures .depending on the fragility of the piece , you can often times using a ceiling fan cleaner to get the dust off .but , to really clean it.
we start out with our arms forward like this .i do a front kick , i pull out my leg to block , do a sidekick low to the knee.
you 'll find you have many choices of inks or writing fluids if you go to the art store , or even to the stationary store .so i just wanted to mention that there are lots of options for using a dipped pen .you can use a india type ink , you can use a sumi type ink , ( that 's what i happen to be using today )there are art inks that come in different colors ( here 's one here ,this ones from , newton ) .higgings is a big company that makes a lot of different inks , you can use india ink , you can use any ink .i prefer inks that are not waterproof because they do n't dry in the pens , and do n't create as much problem with cleaning the pens .so we 're going to be working.
our shrimp pasta salad real quick , real easy .we took some shrimp , we blanched those in a little hot water , put them in a ice bath , took our pasta , cooked our pasta , and then we drained it , rinsed under some cold water to get a lot of the starch off so it would n't stick to each other .we made a dressing a simple dressing with mayo , mustard , seasonings , we added celery , onion , a little bit of garlic , some fresh tomatoes , and then at the end we throw some green onions on top.
we are here talking today about the basics of piano and how this could help to improve your piano playing and you ability to read music .we are going to cover some of the basics and fundamentals of reading the music some of things that go along with that the notes , the different kinds of notes , the key signature the time signature all the things that you need to know to be able to look at and understand what is on the page .first and foremost before you actually sit down to the piano then once we sit down we 'll talk about the different aspects of being able to sit at the piano correctly , being able to find your hand positions , what the notes are , what notes you are looking at.
you know , five card draw is not without its many variations .indeed , there are a number of ways to spruce up the game , if you will , and one of the ways that you can change five card draw , is to flip the rules if you will , and how do i mean ?well , you can play lo- ball .that 's basically , flipping the rules , in that , in low ball , when you say , get what looks like a really great hand , it 's not a good hand .for instance , if you had a full house , that would be a horrible hand in lo-ball .you would need to throw that away if it was after the draw , and what 's the worst hand of all in a lo-ball game ?that would be the royal flush .imagine that , it 's the hardest hand to get , and yet , in a lo-ball game , it 's the worst hand possible , so think about that , and let 's move forward.
alvin dedeaux :okay , so people ask all the time , what is fly fishing ?and basically , fly fishing is using the weighted line to deliver a basically weighted -- weightless fly , and fly fishing is actually one of the oldest forms of fishing .the fly fishing equipment has been around much longer than any other modern type of fishing equipment with the mechanical reels and the monofilament line .those are all fairly modern inventions .nobody is really sure of the origins of fly fishing , but they 're pretty sure it 's been around at least since the 1400s , maybe even sooner .they used bamboo rods back then .now , we use graphite rods , and they used catgut for the actual fly line and leader .actually , silk was used for fly lines for a long time and they used catgut for leaders .now of course , we 're using these modern plastics and monofilaments , but it 's a very ancient form of fishing .so it 's something that 's been around for a long time , and it 's really has n't changed a whole lot since its very beginnings .
alright the drink we are about to make is called the `` casa noble margarita '' .the first thing we 'll do is put some ice in a glass here.
you get a tape measure , have your dog laying down like it would be on a bed and measure your dog to fit comfortably in width .she is about 3 1/2 feet .now that will be a nice bed .
i 'm going to show you how to make a turtle .if you look down here you can see i have a nice square piece of paper and.
okay , in order to work in pro tools , we need to export our project from final cut .let 's take a look at the options that final cut gives us .the first thing we 're going to do is we 're going to export our sequence as a quicktime movie .what that 'll do , it will render all these individual cuts , individual shots that you see here into one quicktime movie .and that 's what we want.
now , something really simple , but let 's make it harder to do .once again , we 're going to go back to a squat as a body weight exercise .i 'm going to show you variations , and how to make this a lot harder with your dumbbells .one of em ' , probably you have n't done before .okay , so we have our basic squat .you all know this .you can add weights anywhere .you can put em ' on your waist , you can take em ' up here , you can add a shoulder press .here is one that 's really hard to do , even with five pounds each .are you ready ?arms are up , slightly in front of you , not behind you ; neck aligned with your spine , and.
hi in this segment we 're going to be ironing a pair of pants and we 're going to be talking about the preparations for that to begin with .now it might sound silly but the first thing you want to do of course is check the pockets , you do n't want anything in there ; paper , money ; anything like that could be ruined with such high temperatures that you 're ironing with , coins ; anything stuck in there will also ; you could actually iron the imprint of the coin right into your , into your pair of pants and that would n't do you any good now.
making a triangle can also be a lot of fun .you can simply start in this case we will do a single crocheted triangle and you simply start with one chain , actually it would be two chains .then in the first chain you make two single crochets and you have just completed your first row .you make a chain turning the yarn then you would make two single crochets in each stitch across then you do the chain as you turn the work around and you continue on in this manner until you have triangle that looks something like this .
hi , i 'm kerri at zebra in berkeley , and i 'm here to tell you about what piercings hurt the most .in general , any cartilage piercing is very , very sensitive and does hurt a lot .that 's on the ear , your nose , in addition to cartilage piercings , the most painful piercings are your nipples .nipples are very , very sensitive and actually hurt even more than some of the other piercings downstairs .one way that you can deal with the pain better and or get rid of the pain is by taking some kind of pain reliever before you receive your piercing , usually about a half an hour to an hour before , that will cut down on your pain .also you can use a topological numbing solution .some piercing places offer it and others.
the catch usually is on the back of the card , the printer  s logo is on the back.
so this super complicated dial , knob , over hear .so , the way to break this one down , so you 've got normal , you 've got permanent press , you 've got short , and you 've got prewash , and then you 've got all this other regular.
now `` insert bypass '' basically allows you to bypass any insert by clicking this `` edit bypass '' button .this basically allows you to click on any type of effect whatever and allows you to bypass just with a click of that button .when i look at right here.
so , today were going to go over a `` d '' flat major scale .which is this nice simple pattern .and were really going to get this pattern under our fingers .and what 's great about it is you can play it off of any fret .so , i can start here , and i can even move it down to a lower fret , and i can move it up a higher fret .so , were going to take this scale and really show you how to utilize it and run it through.
now there are occasions where you can close with something that word for word repeats what you said at the very beginning .it 's still important that it 's going to be different .it 's going to come across different , i should say , of how you came across the beginning .but i 'll show you this example .this an example of this piece that says , no one told me i could write .not a shoelace of instruction of how to tie on these magic sandals of flight .now the whole piece deals with this struggle of that i do n't feel like i 'm qualified to become a writer .watch how i close it by saying the very exact same words that i started with .i will fly not deny prophecy to my nation under ration of vulnerable wit and joking tragedies of gruesome grit are you down with it ?man it does n't matter a bit to me because i know who sees and is pleased with my personality .he gets every accolade that may come my way .it 's his boldness that has freed me from every fear and regulation today .man , no one told me that i could write .
what you want to do is take your file and your finger.
o.k .now that we 're working in this very close area , i put on my magnifiers so that i can see better what 's going on and basically we are going to refine that upper lip a little bit by just doing some fine shaping around this little area here .now one of the things that 's pretty important.
alright you want to start by cleaning your wheel head off from the last project .start with a nice clean wheel head .and then we 've got about two pounds of clay , you can just wedge it right there on your wheel head .going to move it back and forth , alright .make sure your back 's on there .and get this nice and wedged up , just like that .alright now that you got your ball of clay ready to roll , just kind of find the center .i think it already is in the center ,yeah .you want to seal it to your wheel head , and by doing this you make sure that it does n't fly across the studio when you 're trying to center it .so just take your finger and just seal it right down there .if you have a plastic bat , make sure it 's nice and dry before you put it on there because it 'll never get stuck .there you go .now we 're going to center this guy .
a road cyclist are the individuals , and maybe even teams , you see on the road .a lot of them are racers .they 're in tuck position a lot of times on their dropped bars , those are the curled down kinda bars .mountain bikers , those are the guys riding the bikes that have the shocks on the front and sometimes on the back , and smaller wheels , and they are usually dirty from riding in the dirt .then you have the comfort and hybrid cyclist and they 're the guys who like the feel of a mountain bike frame.
ok , this is one of the cones that i made i prefer working with a cone then out of a bottle .for a couple of reasons for one its a little closer to the more ancient way that they used to do it .bottles have become traditional in the last , you know probably fifty years .sense.
there is also another move you can use .it is the spin move .it is a real good move too .come here mikey .it is real simple and it 's a real simple move.
this is called the `` bronx silver cocktail '' .go ahead and start off with putting your ice in your glass like so.
in your swimming workouts , you should emphasize interval training .perhaps more than in any other discipline .that 's the most effective way to train in the pool .so , blocks of hundreds , two hundreds , pyramids where you build fifties , one hundred , one hundred and fifty , two hundred maybe even up to three hundred and then back down are very effective .another effective training method , perhaps once a week or once every two weeks is to do a time trial a four hundred , five hundred or eight hundred meters timed to kind of measure progress .the basic guideline for intervals in swim training is to have between two and three work to one rest ratio .so , for example , if i could swim one hundred in one fifteen off the wall and repeat that effort , i could a group of hundreds , say eight by one hundred for a starting work out perhaps building up to as many as fifteen by one hundred on an interval of one forty five .so , i 'd have a working time of about one minute ,fifteen seconds.
all right .last two aspects of kind of the anatomy of an accordion is there will be a strap that your hand kind of slips in.
in this clip what we 're going to show you is.
they sell it in every grocery store they have just the creo seasoning mix that you can find anywhere.
we chilled it while we were waiting for our lasagna .take a look at this baby , look at that , does n't that look beautiful .look how beautiful it is !i put some fresh basil on top.
and in this series i 'd like to just take you around the studio and show you what would be available for someone to use at a gym .all of this equipment would be fantastic for someone to use in an adaptive program .but i 'm also then going to show you where you might be able to just use it at your home .so if you look around.
now one of the best things to use are these connectors here and you can buy these connectors and they 're rated at different pounds that they 'll hold and this particular one will hold up to about 150 pounds per attach point .and all it is is basically just a heavy threaded screw and one thing that 's nice about it.
this one here has got a nice even dark green texture .they 've been waxed so you 'll see the shininess .you 'll want to wash that off when you get home .but the nice green color from end to end is perfect .this is an english cucumber , so its going to be a little bit lighter , but again you have an even color from end to end .what you do n't want to see , is you do n't want to see something like this .now , granted size really does n't matter in this case .this is not a pickling cucumber , its just a little bit smaller .but , things like that seem to be pretty obvious to me .a little less obvious might be where it dimples in and wrinkles .its dried up .and really all a cucumber is , is its moisture .so if you do n't have that moisture , you do n't have the crisp .and you end up getting a bitterness in the end .and lastly i think its really important , again , we 've talked about it all ready .ice .a grocery stores best friend , maybe not yours .if this is stored directly on ice , whether its in your home or in the grocery store , all of these water crystals or water molecules that are in the cucumber are going to freeze .and when they freeze , they are going to thaw back out.
first abdominal exercise we are going to do is the basic crunch .all you 'll need is your towel , or if you 're at home you can do this on the floor , on carpet , i prefer carpet .go ahead and start on your back .knees are bent at about a ninety degree angle .you 're comfortable .and first what i 'm going to do is show you your basic , basic crunch .you 're going to start with your hands right at your temples , you 're not holding on behind your head because you 're more likely to pull on your head and neck muscles .by holding on just right at your temples you 're less likely to pull on your neck and more likely to use your abdominal muscles .so your basic crunch is going to involve keeping your feet flat on the floor , and you 're going to think about lifting your shoulder blades up off of the floor , tightening your abdominal muscles , bringing your ribs in towards your hips .you 're going to hold for about a two second count and lower back down to the ground .going to lift and lower .i recommend that you just go straight over your knees .i 'm going to show you a couple variations .to increase the intensity , you can bring your feet up off the floor , keep your feet side by side or crossed , ninety degree then .and once again , lift shoulder blades off the floor , tightening , holding , and lowering down .now you do not want to completely lower down and rest , you want to keep those muscles contracted .so i only recommend lowering down a couple of inches .lift up , hold , tighten and lower down .the last variation which is the most challenging is keeping your feet completely straight , or keeping your legs completely straight .up toward the ceiling , and again do n't pull on the head , and lower down .tighten those ab muscles , bring the ribs in towards the hips , lower down .if you do your abdominal muscle , if you do your ab exercises correctly , it 's quality over quantity .so you should n't have to do a hundred or two hundred reps to feel these ab exercises effectively .
hello .i 'm stevie moore .welcome to my studio at the artist 's attic in lexington , kentucky .now i 'd like to explain to you a little bit about some of the brushes we are going to be using today for our wooded scene in oil .there 's three factors , three attributes that every brush has that you need to take into account when selecting it and using it .first would be size .second would be shape of the brush .and the third would be the size of the bristles of the brush .the first types of brushes that we have are going to be our square brushes .and i have several sizes of square brushes .i have a large , fine bristle .and i have two different sized mediums .and i have a very interesting flat brush , that has sort of a mitered cut on it , it 's also good for detailing .and then a small , stubbier flat brush .these , all these brushes have fine bristles .soft and smooth bristles are good for glazing .they are good for moist strokes with very wet , thin paint .they do n't hold as much paint as a stiffer bristled brush and they also do n't give as much texture as a stiff bristle brush .these two brushes i have here are two different shaped brushes that i now use for dry brushing .this is sort of a medium bristled , and this is a very , very soft , plastic bristled brush .this is actually a water color brush .it 's very good for dry brushing and blending , which we 'll see later in the painting .these are my round brushes and.
okay , we 're going to talk to you about the recovery and where to recover .and making sure that you are in the right position on the court .a lot of times , you , you 'll find players that will hit their shot , kind of spectate , look at it , love it and not quite get back ready for the next shot again .you know , this is ball that you 're not really going to come forward on.
now take these chicken salami pieces , which you can easily get from the market .now we need to chop these pieces .place this on the slice , sprinkle some onion , fine chopped onion , fine chopped tomato , some green chili .you can even add some capsicum .and then sprinkle some pepper and salt , as per your taste .and then cover this with another slice of bread and then place it on the toaster and leave it for three to four minutes .so , now after four minutes , your toast is ready .so let 's see .now we take this toast , since it 's properly toasted , place it on a plate.
now we 're going to show you a great exercise for your legs and your butt .these are called step ups .naturally , you can at any place you 've got a step .if you 're in your house , nice small step .if you want a challenge , then get a chair out .just make use a piece of furniture is not going to fall down when you step up on it .so what you 're going to do is keep your torso straight up and down.
hi .i 'm amy erinberger and.
now we 're going to be talking about the movement on the serve .before you start the serve , you want to establish a routine .i like to bounce the ball a couple of times just to think of what i 'm going to be doing .then i prepare my toss by putting the ball under the neck of my racket .i like to do it in three steps , it makes it simple .so one , it 's going to be starting with the shoulders looking to the side of the court , head looking to where you are going to be pointing the ball and your opponent .bring the racket about this area .you can bring it a little more down if you want to , just the purpose is that you bring it farther away than your knees so that you can keep your shoulders open instead of like.
this clip is about snoots , snoots are an actual addition to your strobes that just clip on , and different ones clip on different ways .this one has three spring clips that make it easy to go on and off .what it is , is it actually channels the light down from a big broad light source to a very narrow one .it gives you a lot more control over your light ; it maintains the circular shape of the light .it 's really nice , so if you wanted to like go in and put just like an extra light on someone 's face or a product that 's in amongst other products so you can highlight that product separately .they are real easy to use , they are fairly inexpensive , they do get hot , if you leave the modeling light on your strobe , if you leave it on all the time , then when you take this off , it 's going to burn your hands because it will absorb the heat from the modeling light .when you purchase a snoot , keep in mind that it has to fit on the size of the reflector that comes with your , with your strobe head .there are different size reflectors and different size snoots .just because one 's a seven inch snoot , it may not go on a seven inch reflector from another manufacturer.
okay , you could start from the feet together , fist to hip position .okay , you want to step out in a horse stance .okay .now , the twisting punch , you twist in a bow , and you throw the punch straight out with your shoulders in a line .you want to keep the chest straight , the buttocks tucked in , front thigh parallel , back leg straight .now , in the twisting punch you perform two actions .okay .twisting with the sleeve block and then executing the second punch .okay .you want to do it at the same time ,so you block , shift , and then punch straight out .okay , from the side view .okay , you notice the shoulders are in a line , front leg is parallel , then he blocks straight up , twists , punch .then again , blocks straight up , twists and punch .now , it 's very important as you perform the blocking and the punch , that you stay level , so that way you have the proper distance for the punch.
in this clip i 'm going to be showing you some weapons that we 're going to be fighting with .this is our dagger .it has , there are a few different parts to a dagger .you 've got your hilt , which is everything below here .so this would be the handle.
and one thing i might have done there would be to pre-wet the pearlite to avoid breathing any of that dust .and now that i have my mix somewhat completed i 'm going to go ahead and wet it and mix it using this spade fork , excellent mixing tool .it 's almost like mixing concrete , if you 've done that .just trying to create a blend and begin to suss out what out , what our final needs are here .there are several other things i might add .this is some green sand minerals .nope , that 's finished compost , excuse me , organic compost .we can inoculate that with some organic compost that someone else has made .and over here we have mineral called green sand , which is mined in new jersey , and the green sand adds micronutrients to the mix .some people would say with a good compost that 's unnecessary .and now we 're getting close to finished , and i 'm going to either hand or tool.
at this point it 's up to you if you want to adjust the how much heat you want in there , me i like to push it up so were mixing that heat in with our red , yellow , green bell pepper , onion , celery , holy trinity .our herbs parsley basil , thyme , and.
an alternative to face plates and drive center for holding your work and driving it are what they call a four jaw scroll chuck .what these chucks do is contract or expand all 4 jaws at one time .this particular model works through the use of a single key .a similar model , this one works off a system of pins where you put the 2 levers in and by holding one and moving the other you can open and contract the jaws .the advantage of these systems are that the jaws are interchangeable .you can go from working with a jaw as small as these up to putting on a face plate .these are called a coal type jaw for holding bowls .this type jaw is used for holding long items up to a foot long without support on the lathe and you also have a set of jaws here that will hold a number of different types of diameters of wood .
i have my cornbread out.
and what you want to do is figure out how big your door step is so that when you make your frame , it will fit your rug to go in front of your door .and what we want to do then is get some l connectors at the hardware store and screws and if you do n't have a saw , you want to get a saw and maybe a little sandpaper .and you want to cut two short pieces and two long pieces .you want to make sure that they 're about this much bigger than the rug you want to make so.
now , we just discussed a minor second interval .this would be a major second interval .now , going back to the major scale , as we just took a look at , the major scale is whole step , whole step , half step , whole step , whole step , whole step , half step .so , if we start from g again and you go up a whole step , and another whole step , we 're going to stop there for a minute and just look at the distance from the first note in a major scale to the second note in a major scale.
one more combination upper and lower body exercise is going to be a leg extension with an external rotation of the upper body so create your loop , place it around your ankle , tighten it up , step on the tube ,ball of the foot is on the floor , tighten the hip of the leg you are standing on but keep the knee soft .you are going to be doing a hip extension exercise and with the arm external rotation .external rotation is good for anyone who plays softball .we do a lot of internal rotation in our regular daily life.
so if you 're going through on the internet , you 're going to see this all over the place .so we 're going to start here.
many people hear of tangrams in the classroom .that 's the first exposure they have to the puzzle .tangrams works well in the classroom because it demonstrates proportions and ratios , it also teaches about shapes .you have right triangles.
we 're going to be focusing on a hand technique called rear uppercut .the rear uppercut is a close-in technique , starting from a high position , going low and punching upward .mainly this is either thrown to the body or to the head .i 'll demonstrate it at normal speed for you , then i 'll have melissa demonstrate it a little bit slower to point out some details .again in my position , my body is nice and loose .now , not forcing anything , i 'm going to row my body slightly to the right .my right hand is going to drop.
it 's really simple .these are haas avocados.
after you 've prepped your container , the next step is to green the container .so , first we 're going to find a greenery that 's really going to enhance the design .now this is a very small , petite design , so we would n't want to use something like lemon leaf because it 's going to totally overwhelm the design .it 's just way too big .this is much better for a bigger design .so , what i did is i went out and picked some pittosporum which a lot of people have growing in their yard , and it 's totally fine to use in this design .it 's got a nice , cute little umbrella shape and it will fill in nicely .it 's the right proportion to the teacup .so , we can use all these little pieces .so we 're using the pittosporum , and we 're also going to use the seeded eucalyptus as an accent greenery .so , this has kind of a nice , lazy design which will also almost mimic what 's on the plate and on the container .this has a nice little decorative element , the seeded eucalyptus .and that is how you select your greenery .
so today i 'm going to talk to you about compact digital cameras.
let 's take a look at the guitar .so far , this is where we 're at .okay ?from this position , we 're just going to slide our pinkie up to the 3rd fret of the b string ,okay ?we 're going to put our middle finger back to the 2nd fret .we 're going to hit them all together to start .hit the bass note , then high , then bass , then take your middle finger off and hit them all together again .hit the bass , and then we 're going to take our index finger and put it on this 1st fret of the g string .this third bar sounds like this .and then we move into the fourth bar .we 're going to slide our fingers , our ring and pinkie , back to the 2nd fret of the g and the b string .then we 're going to hit the open a string now with our thumb and hit the g and b strings with our fingers here .it sounds like this .bass , high , bass , together , bass , together .okay ?the third bar , again , sounds like this .and then into the fourth bar .all together , all four bars sound like this .then it starts again .all right , we 're about to start our top 5 countdown .join me in our next segment , we 'll take a look at number 5.see you there .
they 're in our pockets ; they 're in our purses .they 're everywhere in our life .we use them all the time .they 're ringing , they 're buzzing , they 're going off at all times .kiss of death in an interview is that if you don  t care enough to turn your phone , i probably do n't care enough to hire you .my thinking is and has always been and.
ok ?`` hello there , good sir !i 'm thirsty and need to be quenched .
let 's say that you went out and you had your run .you come back , and your back 's really tight --your back 's hurting .you have your hamstrings and your hips that you 're flexing every day , have someone take a look at your form because you want to make sure that you have a strong posterior chain .now , your posterior chain is your hamstrings , your glutes , and your spinal rectors are the ones that run up and down your upper back .and the way that ...
again , i 'm going to be using bubble wrap for these because these are extra delicate and extra special .you just get a roll , whatever size you need for whatever it is that you 're wrapping .this actually is double layer , so i can go ahead and put my little figurine in there .then i 'm going to go ahead and just take my scissors and cut a piece .i 'm actually going to make mine a little bigger right there .just cut it .then you just go ahead and roll it up .that 's going to be nice and secure .then just go with the next one .i 'm going to do the baby jesus next .this baby jesus is well loved in my family .my kids like to keep it next to their night tables during christmas .it 's a lot of fun .again , just take your piece , measure how much bubble wrap you want , cut it , and it really could n't be easier .if you have any leftover , obviously the kids love to go ahead and play popping these .i recommend always having a little bit of bubble wrap lying around .i 'm going to finish wrapping these in a minute .my going to take these guys out of here .then this is going to go right back into the original box that it came in .this is really the best way to pack this away .it has some styrofoam in there .it 's going to be well protected , and because it is so neatly packed and so tightly packed in there , it 's actually a great place for me to go ahead and put my figurines in there .then everything 's going to be in one spot .i 'm going to go ahead and finish this up.
some people do n't have the strength to use kettlebells , or anything else for that matter , but you can start them out with the rope .and some of the things you can do is , for instance , you grab it underhanded , pull out , squat , press .it 's going to be a slight bit forward so squat , press , squat , press , squat , press , alternate arms .and what that does is they are leaning back against the ropes.
so we 're going to put the first two phrase of the guitar solo from `` i 'm satisfied with you '' , together .( playing )i 'm going to play it really slowly now .( playing )
our potatoes are just about done .so , we 're going to take our oregano ; we 're not really even going to remove it from the stem because these stems are all very , very soft .so i 'm going to go over to the middle of my knife to initially cut the oregano .i 'm going to turn it and bunch it all back up together and do it again .i 'm going to turn it one more time.
one of my favorite styles right now , is this one that i show you here , a dome skirt .i love the way the silhouette flares out in the middle of the skirt , and then jets back in .for some reason , i think it 's just the cutest thing in the world , but not everybody you 're designing for , is going to be able to pull off this look , because it does add extra volume , hence , extra mass through the body .it 's not skintight , and it 's going to look like you have a caricature of hips , but it 's really cute when done correctly , so this is a dome skirt .we 'll do a natural waist line , and i want this to fall right above the knees , so i make my hemline , and then what makes it a dome skirt , is the fact that it , i was going to say domes out , but it does n't make sense .it goes out .it flares out , and then back in , creating the dome look , so you could have it be huge , or you can have it like his .i prefer just a little bit , so do this , and then in order to show better that it is a dome skirt , i added these seam lines , because they parallel the curvature of the dome , and just makes it more apparent for you , makes the point come across better .
one of the more interesting needles that we use in chinese medicine is what 's known as the seven star needle .the seven star needle is oftentimes used for large areas such as along the spine , for pain or certain muscles that run parallel to the spine , or even on the arms or legs .this needle is actually a handle that the practitioner is able to work with , as well as a series of seven small prongs at the head of the needle .this is actually used in a tapping motion along the body and may feel , at first , actually quite relaxing ,at some point it may feel a little uncomfortable , so be sure that you give feedback to your practitioner .once he 's able to get a little bit of a sensation there with the seven star needle , that 's time for him to move on to another area .unfortunately the best way to equate it is somewhat similar to a meat tenderizer , although not quite as mean .so when we use this needle , you 're going to feel a tapping on your back .and so the practitioner will work this along that area of the spine , and oftentimes after the treatment , you 'll actually have a little bit of a rash and perhaps a little bit of scabbing .so that 's natural and expected and will go away within a few days .so do n't be surprise if it 's a little bit itchy and then give feedback to your practitioner .this is oftentimes use in combination with the normal filiform acupuncture and should be just as relaxing as the rest of your treatment .so enjoy your seven star needle treatment along with everything else .
it 's really nourishing for the skin .it 's like food for the skin with all the , the added nutrients in there .and it 's really going to help tone the complexion and smooth out the texture in addition to firming , which everybody loves .so this is one of our very best , most popular anti-aging treatments .and with the moisturizer , you just want to apply liberally and just spread it all over the main areas of the face.
clancy rose : all right .so now that you know everything that you have to have to assemble the single americano , we 're going to talk about the main ingredient in the single americano which would be the beans that we 're using for the espresso shot .one of the most common misconceptions about espresso roast is that coffee is roasted darker for espresso which is n't necessarily true .you can use any coffee that you want for any espresso shot .what makes an espresso an espresso is the process of making the espresso .it 's the extraction process .it 's the ratio of coffee to water being a lot higher than the ratio of coffee to water in a normal cup of coffee .so for a single americano , you can use whatever coffee you like and just a coffee that you 're comfortable with the flavors , keeping in mind that in espresso extraction any flavors in the coffee are going to be a whole lot more intense than a regular cup of coffee .
schmuel : okay .so now we 're ready to put this all together .and since this recipe will feed , basically , 8 to 12 people , we 're going to use -- this is a 9 x 13 casserole pan .and we need to grease it , so we 're just using some of our spray canola oil .you can use any type of spray .you can oil it by hand .it does n't really matter .it should just be greased , so that you 'll be able to clean it up easier .and just pour in your mac and cheese mixture .and those lumps , that 's our cottage cheese .and that 's really going to be nice once it gets heated .it 's not going to taste lumpy .it 's just going to taste really kind of delicious .and this kind of -- it 's self-leveling like a good self-leveling concrete .umm , wow , that 's some good stuff , okay .then on top of that , we have our crumb mixture .we 're going to sprinkle that as evenly as possible over this .and i do n't know if i told you about preheating your oven to 350 degrees 'cause.
hi , i 'm les whitley .here today to talk about stretching the muscles of the shoulders .the muscles can divided into multiple different components .ideally the muscles of the upper part of the shoulder as well as the muscles of the upper back .you begin by stretching these as any ; you always want to think about warming up the muscle first .ideally with some nice full range of shoulder rotations forward , backward .nice easy arm hugs crossing your arms alternating one on top of the other to improve blood flow and to warming up the muscle efficiently .the by improving the flexibility start with a straight arm across the body stretch grabbing above the elbow pulling across the body until you feel a tightness in the upper part of the back and rear of the shoulder .holding these stretches anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds to improve flexibility .on both sides of course for good balance then progressing to the front part of the shoulder , ideally with elbow bent slightly lower than shoulder level .use a stable object such as a post or a door frame ; begin by turning your body away from that stable object until you feel a slight little pull in the front .this will also help stretch out the muscles of the chest as well .key point to keep the elbow below shoulder level to minimize the impact and the stress on the joint , holding again for 15 up to 30 seconds for flexibility improvement .repeating on both sides of the body and incorporating daily into a good part of your routine to help improve shoulder flexibility .warming up the muscles that you 're going to be stretching is a key-portent part before you begin any flexibility routine to allow that muscle to appropriately move through all ranges of motions .
have you heard this phrase ?come seven , come eleven ?baby needs a new pair of shoes ?and then someone throws a pair of dice .well , that is craps .now , craps is a casino stall work , right ?and , much money exchanges hands in the game of craps .usually , and always every time it 's from the player to the casino , because there 's no way to beat craps long term , but we can have a lot of fun playing the game.
this is going to be part two of how to throw your ball .there ?s a couple more tips that i needed to tell you about .a couple of things is , you want to keep your shoulders square .so if you 've watched me in the clip before , i kind of dip up my right shoulder a little bit , make sure that my right shoulder is square with my left one .when you come through with the ball , you want to make sure your shoulders are square towards your marks .another good tip is with your arms , after your right arm comes down past your knee , you want to keep your left arm straight out in front of you , as you follow through bring your left arm back , behind you and follow through .this way it keeps you balanced and square towards your mark .
the next plug in is chorus .now chorus is going to add multiple signals together to create kind of a spacey type sound as well .what we can do is we can go into our modulation inserts and select chorus , stereo .now what we can do is look through the different presets and press play just to check out what they 've got already on here .so i 'm going to look in here , glimmering chorus .now we 're going to cycle through each of them .when looking at or working with any of these choruses remember that you can always change the mix to get that desired sound that you 're looking for .the mix is basically going to allow you to turn up the wet signal and the dry signal .now the , the , the wet signal is going to be the chorus effected signal and.
but , i think we should shape it some more .now you can use finger tips to shape our bowl , and again you got to get it wet , or we can use our tools .i want to show you this tool , a cd a regular old cd.
this next clip is going to be a one armed row with a rotation .okay , you 're going to take your stability band .you 're going to attach it onto a base .remember to make sure it 's nice and secure .now what you 're going to do is you 're going to grab your band .make sure you have enough distance behind you and you 're going to do a one armed row with a rotation .you 're going to feel some additional torque in your obliques as you turn .so you 're going to start off with overhand grip .okay , when you turn the palm is going to go down .you 're going to pivot your body .okay , you 're starting off in almost a lunge-type stance , knees slightly bent , and you 're going to rotate that right foot out .okay .your shoulders should stay level with your elbow .overhand grip , we 're going to rotate out .okay .you 're twisting almost like into a semi-lunge position , keeping that shoulder and elbow in alignment , palm flat .so you 're almost getting two exercises in one .
let 's step it up outside with step ups .first , you need an elevated location .make sure that your knee is either even with or below your hip .you are going to step your feet together to match that level and then step back down .basic .you are going to work that lower body .and that constant movement is going to get your heart rate up as well .so you can do this.
they do not use the directions .the compass .but what they using is the ba gua .that is you see it very often .the ba gua it 's using the exactly the same feng shui principle as the classic.
so , when we 're doing painting , what we 're really doing is we 're creating these perceptual contrasts .use of red , use of green , is , creates brightness , that we would n't ordinarily be aware of .by using green , selectively , around these red objects , even though it may not be exactly the pattern that 's on there , although that was the intent when the designer of that piece of fabric was doing it .they were using the same technique of off-setting the reds with the greens , in order to make them , each of those colors , more brilliant .so , we have the ability as the artist to control what the brain sees .and so , i use those awarenesses that color does that , and the way that complimentary colors set each other off and make them more brilliant .purposefully , to make the paintings much more interesting .again , i 'm going to continue to refer to my original source material , and take liberties , wherever i want to .what this ends of looking like , ultimately , is a combination of what we see , and what i develop as i 'm working , using these devices of complimentary colors , in order to make it more interesting and to give it more dynamic range , and visual interest and texture .
now we are going to just arrange our mushrooms.
and i 'm going to show you the things that we do before we take an alpaca to the show , to an alpaca show .the first thing we have to do is make sure that they 're halter trained .make sure that they 're comfortable going in and out of a halter , making sure that having this thing around their muzzle does n't spook them out at all .make sure that the halter fits that the halter sits high enough up on the nose.
now , we 're going to show the drawing of the foot taper .so , we 're going to use some ice picks and our stick to draw a nice , smooth curve to get our foot taper .we 're going to be using a long , straight stick and this particular stick.
now we 've drawn our angry expression , let 's move on to something more happy .literally so , happy expression time .keep in mind our neutral expression , and what we 're going to do is you 're going to see the eye shape is largely going to be the same on this one .and , we 're going to draw our eyes the same way .we 're not going to draw eyelids because this is going to be an excited , happy expression .so we 're going to leave those off .we 're going to draw a nose the same as we would otherwise .we 're going to draw the eyebrows up here tilting upwards , slightly .very subtly off balanced , because this is going to be an excited , happy expression on your face .we 're going to draw , of course , here the u-shape everyone knows .usually , i like to add something else .a bit of a smile .which is , basically , i draw a nearly vertical line and then skew it back in .and on this one , actually , i do n't mind using some vertical lines to note some teeth .draw in our ears over here .we bunch up the cheeks .especially one over , actually on this side , where we do n't have the mouth .because you have kind of a bit of a crooked grin going on , so this side of the head will be bunched up some .not in anger this time , in happiness .draw the jaw line , come back and around .this side is slack .draw in hair in here .now other things you can do to also denote happiness are you can have lines coming out of the top .i 'll draw these in here because people are really happy .i mean this guy ,wow !he just looks like he just won a million bucks !maybe he did !you want to go for ultra effects , you can even draw in some extra shapes , like stars here at the top , but that 's optional .this guy looks pretty happy enough .
blood money is a registered trademark of io interactive , a company with which i have no affiliation .so we just drop down , tap x to hide the fiber wire .and now , we 've got a power box here .we can press the a button to disable the power box and turn out the lights on the drug lab.

next we 're going to plug the wiring from the trailer into the truck .what this is going to do is give us brake lights , tail lights , turn signals on our trailer just like in our vehicle so people behind you still know if you 're stopping , if you 're turning .it 's just a safety precaution .and as far as i know you have to have lights on your trailer in every state .this is the type of plug we 're going to use .this is a plug that 's set up for not only lights but also trailer brakes .and this is where we have have the plug in mounted to the vehicle .and just on the top of this there 's a raised slot and in here that 's on top .you 're going to slide that in .and the cap on this actually holds this in from popping out .it hooks on to that raised slot on top .there are a few different kinds for just basic lights .you can have a flat plug like this one .nice thing about this connection.

and you know what ?you can take your life into your own hands sometimes when you go into there to cheer for the opposing team .i 'm going to give you a little background story ,i 'm getting a little nostalgic here .there 's a time where i went with my father-in-law to a yankees game .they were playing the minnesota twins .we were in yankee stadium .and the twins are starting to kick some booty.
a frequently asked question by many patients are whether or not the herbs that we 're prescribing to them are safe and free from things like lead and arsenic , that we hear so often that are coming out of china in certain products .and that is a very , very good question to make sure that you ask your practitioner .there are some brands that are very safe , that they 're doing appropriate testing for heavy metals , such as lead and arsenic .they 're checking for things like bacteria , and they 're checking to make sure that the proper plant has been used in that herbal formula .so , ask your patient-your practitioner these types of questions before you willingly accept that the herbs that they prescribe to you .something else that 's oftentimes brought up in relationship to chinese herbs , and that 's whether or not they have been adulterated with pharmaceuticals or other kinds of over-the-counter chemicals , such as tylenol , or even prescription medications .and that 's something that very few brands have .it has been a problem in the past , but now , with the more reputable companies that have factories that are approved by the fda and have been inspected , they meet good manufacturing programs from the gmp .so , make sure that your practitioner gives you the good quality herbs that are safe .and , unfortunately , when you want to get the good quality herbs , they oftentimes cost a few dollars more .so , take that time to make sure you get the most effective herbs , and the safest herbs , that are available on the market .and ask good questions of your practitioner to ensure that they 're following good manufacturing practices .
you want to first break you opponents balance coming to the front .once his legs is in front again easy and bring back you need to pull back with both hands as we are doing the sweep .jonathan is going to show us .notice he sweeps him before the leg is down on the ground in firm.
now we 're going to learn the drop down with your first hand .come up into lasso with your first hand .look up at the hoop .notice when the hoop opens up in front of your body .take your second hand and start to reach up through that opening in the hoop .the next time your second hand reaches up into the hoop , we 're going to turn and drop the hoop down to our waist .second hand reaches up , turn , and release at the waist .let 's go over that a little bit more .starting up here in lasso with your first hand .second hand reaches up and guides the hoop down .your right hand comes across the chest and releases right here at the waist .then do n't forget to start hooping around your waist .come up in to lasso with your first hand , second reaches through circling , and release at the waist .one more time .take the hoop up into lasso .second hand reaches through the hoop , hoop drops across the chest and releases at the waist .once you start to feel this , you do n't have to use your second hand as a guide .you can just start to release the hoop down and turn .turning is really helpful as you 're learning this move .it slows down the hoop a little bit and just makes it quite a bit easier .i 'll show you one more time .alright .nice job .
in this clip , we 're going to be doing a forward lunge with the coaster and a cuff .okay .you are already going to have your exercuffs on .place your coaster on the floor .place the balls of your right foot on the coaster .and we are going to lunge forward nice and slow .okay .i like to extend my arms forward .if that 's not comfortable for you , you can put your hands on your hips .create some additional stability .keeping your back nice and straight .remember this is slow and controlled .extending forward .the knee should n't go forward of the toe .back should be nice and straight .shoulders back and relaxed .okay .slide forward .your should be feeling this in your quadriceps , your hams , your gluts and your calve muscles .going to slide forward to our lunge position .watch those knees make sure they do n't go forward the toes .going to slide forward nice and slow .maintain your lunge position .and slowly bring your feet back together to the starting position .these are kind of challenging.

now we need to know what kind of clothes do we need to put in it .are we going on a trip to the sunny south ?do we need our shades , and our swimsuits , and our suntan lotion ?or , are we going to a wintry wonderland where we need to be warm and cozy ?all things that you need to take into consideration when you 're putting together your wardrobe .it 's always best to have a layered kind of look where ever you 're going be it to a warm climate or in chilly temps .always go so that you can be warmer , put on , or take off .we 'll be back in a second and we 'll see exactly what kind of things we 'll make work for us in both those fields .
alright , first let 's talk about analyzing characteristics .and the first thing that i recommend that you take a look at is culture .now when i 'm talking about culture , i 'm talking about where is your audience from .and you probably have lots of different cultures making up your audience .you might have people , and when i talk about culture , i 'm talking about culture within the united states like texas vs new york , california vs florida .all of us that live in different states , we have slightly different cultures .but i 'm also talking about different places around the world .you might have americans , you might have britons , you might have australians , you might have indonesians , you might have chinese , japanese .whatever it is , first take a look at the cultural makeup of the audience .then based on that cultural makeup , you want to take into consideration , things that could be offensive to people of that culture as you pick your topic , and as you write your speech .so you might have to do a little further research once you find out the cultures of where your audience is from .
now we are ready to put on the final patina which will give it that antiquie flavor .right ?so here we have our patina it comes also in copper.
now that you know how to juggle , what you need to do is just practice it enough so that you actually can .learning from a video is a little hard , but you need to go home and practice it on your own .and everything should work out if you do it long enough .so you know how to juggle , what you need to do now is find something worth juggling .there are a couple different things that people usually juggle .what i 'm using right now are called loose filled bean bags .and they 're just , they 're just like a hacky sack or something , just a very loose bean bag .a lot of jugglers use these for higher number juggling .if you 're juggling five or more .i like them a lot.
so there are a couple of things you can do to make it a simple process .the most obvious thing is to make a list of everything you have .not only should you use a written check list but you should also make a count of everything you have and every time you move equipment , just do a count ;1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 make sure you have everything .much like people do wi3th luggage .keep all of your items labeled .you can do it with a sharpie , you can do it with stickers .stickers are actually a great way because if you are in a dark club , people may not be able to read the little notes that you have on your amp.
now we have our azalea here .we fixed it all up.
bow forward , stretch your arms back behind you .then bend your knees and reach back and hold the tops of your feet , hug in with your arm muscles and.
what you 're going to do is instead of having the back legs.
just a simple stitching nothing/no fancy embroidery stitches here .we would come down to the middle and we are making it a little upside down triangle for the nose .we would fill that nose in with satin stitches and satin stitches is just a fancy name for straight stitches going back and forth .you want to fill in the whole nose .just keep stitching back and forth .they also have little like clip on eyes .you can also buy clip on noses .so they come in all different sizes and colors .so if you are not so interested in doing embroidery there is a lot of other options .so you come and after you do the triangle you come start another line.
okay , there 's two other buttons on the top here .one of them is the auto focus/manual focus , so you can adjust the focus manually if you want to do a manual focus but most of the time the automatic focus is correct .you 've also got an automatic focus with a picture of a sort of an icon of a flower and that 's so that you can do macro with the setup on the automatic focus there .this is the different modes , so you 've got programmable , which is probably what most people will use .you 've also got aperture priority which means that you set an aperture for the lens , and you 're able to , and the cameras computer and electronics sets it up so that the shutter speed will be adjustable and.
in this segment we 'll talk about rolling the joints .we begin with rolling the neck , now when you do this it 's not about trying to use your muscles , trying to do a big movement .it could be a very , very small movement but what you want to do is to move from the perspective of the spine itself .so you have to really look inwardly.
now , moving through the circle of fifths , we move on to g.
i 'm a travel agent .and did you know that traveling on america 's railways is not only a fun and affordable way to travel , but it 's very exciting and educational , too .let 's say you want to go from philadelphia to harrisburg .well , it 's pretty simple .all you need to do is call 1-800-usa-rail , and then you 'll connect with your good friends over at amtrak .or do what i like to do .i like to go to their interactive website .it 's very cool .not only will it show you a map of the route -- in this case , the keystone route map -- but it 'll also give you an interactive area where you could put your itinerary and simply choose your preferences , hit a button.
this is common basil and we have different kinds of basils , but this one like most of the basils , needs a good deal of moisture .i like to break off little sprigs sometimes .and use it in cooking .you can use it around chicken dishes .but , i also just break off little sections sometimes , just for teas .you 're having some iced tea , or hot tea , and you want to add some flavor to it , break off a little section of leaf , and it makes a nice pick-me-up for your tea as well .but you can use it , of course , in many different dishes .it does require a good deal of peat moss and organic material for it to do it 's best .make sure that you water it on a regular basis .this means the size of the container , and this clay pot may be every second or third day .do n't let it get too dry , or it tends to go to seed .it will flower , and then the plant sometimes starts to shut down .often with herbs you 're going to keep picking off that new growth and.
in this clip , we 'll talk about where to get information on ocd .one of the quickest and easiest ways is to hop on the internet in the world wide web .the one thing you want to do is if you type in ocd for example on one of the search engines , you 're going to get pages and pages and pages of information.
today we 're going to talk about the parts of a skateboard .first and foremost you have the deck .on the deck , you apply the grip tape , the grip tape 's used to help your feet stick to the skate deck when doing tricks .next we have the trucks .the trucks of a skateboard are like , are also called the axles .you have the truck , the base plate , the bushings , which act like a shock or a cushion when it comes to turning , and the axle nut .by adjusting this nut you can loosen it to steer better , or tighten to steer less .next you have your wheels , inside each wheel is two ball bearings .these bearings sit inside the wheel , one on the front side , one on the back side , they mount to the truck like so .next up , you have the riser pads .the riser pad goes between the skate deck and the truck to provide cushion and clearance between your wheels and your board .you need this clearance for your turning radius so your wheels do n't scrape your board .last but not least , you have the mounting hardware .the mounting hardware goes through the deck , through the riser pad , and through the truck , and twist the nut onto the hardware screw , securing the deck , the riser and the truck all together .these are the basic components of a skateboard .
in five card draw poker , every player that is playing would actually put in an ante to put in the original pot .each player is then dealt five cards .they will then look at their five cards and decide if they like the five cards they have or if they would like other cards .initially , once they 've seen their cards , it 'll move to the dealer 's left and that first player will have the chance to actually make a bet .they can either bet , check or basically pass .if they pass , the next person in line will be the one responsible for making the bet .after all the betting round is over , they will then look at their cards and will have an option of discarding some cards and getting cards in return .so let 's say i had a hand.
well that has an interesting story .when we first started the business of , we 're not much of a business to begin with .and we started as an ice cream/juice bar place where we introduced sandwiches .and this one company used to bring us our bread with a whole bunch of fuss and difficulties .and to make a long story short his attitude was really bad .so one day i told him , `` you know what ?give me one month.
i 'm here to speak to you about how to arrange vacation time after divorce .now , very often , each parent wants to take their child with them to the , a vacation , a summer vacation .and sometimes you have conflicting times when you , vacations may fall at the same time .this is very important to work out ahead of time .if you 're lucky , you 'll do it at the time of the divorce and it becomes part of your divorce papers .what many parents do , is use alternate years .for instance , on odd years , the mother has the child for vacations , and on even years the husband takes the child for vacations .they may do the same thing with christmas and new year 's vacation , thanksgiving .one parent may get the odd years and one parent may get the even numbered years .and , that way , it 's all pre-set and pre-established , and both parents get to share in the child 's welfare .where you have difficulty is when each parent wants the same time , and that 's obviously not going to happen .ah , hopefully both of you will co-operate with this .if you have it pre-set and pre-planned and adhere to that plan , you 'll all have a much happier child in the long run .and , i think that 's what we all look for , mostly for the benefit of the child .i wish you luck in your extended families and in your future endeavors , good luck and god bless .
, this is a little bit more of a carry over exercise , these are called ice skaters .now , if you have anybody that 's inline skating or is an ice skater , this is much more sport specific .not saying that you can do this with someone that does n't ice skate , but what it focuses on it focuses on the glut medias .the muscle that 's right in the glut and focus on the stability on the opposite ankle .this is great for focusing on stabilization from the ankle all the way to the hips .ice skaters are a great way to make sure that you keep your body and keep things in motion and constantly keep a lower muscular efficient workout as ari is doing right now .also too , to make it a little bit harder you can also even go into the ice skater with touching down here touching to the floor , touching to the floor .excellent job , keeping your chest upright in everything that you do .making sure that you stay as efficient and only go to the speed that you can .these drills are a lot harder than they seem .
what we 're going to do today is we 're going to go through and kind of introduce you to the lathe , tools , chucks , wood , a little bit of everything , grinding , just kind of a quick overview .not really in depth ,but we 're going to try to touch a lot of things to give you a quick overview and have some fun doing it and make it pretty informative to you so you can maybe watch some other clips and know a little bit more about what they 're talking about .that 's what we 're going to do today .
and i 'm here to answer the question.
wiggle the fork to break up the cell of the lemon and get as much juice out of it as possible .give that a little of rotated and you can turn it and fold it the other way.
okay , in this one we 're going to go over a three step movement to the front corner .what you want to think about when you 're going to go with a three step , it 's going to be left foot first , right foot , which then sets up your lunge for the final shot , to the , with the third step .so this is very , very good to .now if you 're right here , let 's say you get a ball that 's short , you might even do a two step .so it 's really the same as the four step movement to the ball , but we 're taking out two of the steps because it 's still going to be right foot , left foot , and you cover .and there 's the occasional.
the important thing on a book that is like that ; a biography , a science book ; a history book is that you make them interesting , this is where you really have to capitalize on your loud , soft ; high , low ; fast , slow and operative words if you 're putting a book like that on tape .if you are putting a fiction book on tape or a story on tape.
ok.so , there are three types of pressures that we use when we 're working on a horse .light pressure to warm up with .moderate pressure to kind of really work the area .heavy pressure as a horse gets used to the moderate pressure and then back down to a light pressure as a closing stroke .so , let 's look at spy 's chest , for instance .when i 'm working on this , i 'll start by doing light pressure , just back and forth to get him used to me touching him there and get used to the sensation of what i 'm doing .moderate pressure .and heavy pressure .and what that 's going to do is really get the blood circulation going in that area .the impact of my hand is going to help loosen up the muscle tissues .and then you back down again to lighter pressure to close with .
the stance that we 're going to be learning today is called our steel stance .the steel stance is mainly used to go ahead and advance forwards without bringing your body weight through the position .to perform the steel stance , melissa is going to go ahead , and let me have you turn to face this , melissa .let me have your feet twice the width of your shoulders .the same distance that we would be for our bow and arrow stance or our horse stance .bring them in just a little bit closer , right there .ok , placing the hands onto your waist .now , this is a twisting position , so melissa is going to turn her head this way , she 's going to allow her left foot to turn all the way out totally in this direction .at this point , she 's going to bring this shoulder forward , turning , and she 's going to shift away forward , and look over your this way .there we go .this way .now , this leg is straight , with your heel pointing up .this knee is bent , and we want to try to keep the knee over the ankle .now this position , in the beginning , this is a fine level to start at .eventually we want to work it to where our thigh is level with the floor .want to relax the torso , right , and relax your ribs so you get a nice , good twist .this is how we perform our steel stance in kung fu .
one of the most dangerous places.
as you 're learning how to spin poi , it might not be obvious at first.
now i 'm going to show you some more scales to improvise over the key of b flat .first of course is the key of b flat major scale 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7 , just go on and get it under your fingers .then using the bebop technique you can add in side notes , those little chromatic passing tones .for you people who do n't know what chromatic passing tones is chromatic means using every note , the passing tone is using a note outside of the scale to get into the next note into the scale .you got the bebop blue scale , the top of the black notes.
so earlier i taught you how to start a yoyo dead by hitting it on the string , i think it looked like this , and that 's a great way to start a yoyo .and like i said it 's a cool way to start a yoyo.
in this clip , we 're going to talk about the proper service procedure in order to remove and replace a broken cv joint also known as a drive shaft on a front-wheel drive vehicle .in this step , we 're going to talk about the proper service procedure for reinstalling your vehicle 's wheel and snugging of your lug nuts .what i 'm going to do is just take and roll the wheel over and line it up with the studs .i 'm going to grab a hold of it here in one of the vented portions of the rim .look through the holes and line it up on the studs .i 'm going to grab some lug nuts here .i 'm going to take and use my foot to hold the wheel flat against the hub assembly .take a lug nut .i like to start one on the bottom first .what that will do is hold it from cocking out.
calab labarda :alright , the next section we 're going to do we 're going to go over helicopter spins , making it more advance .so , before helicopter spins at one , two , doing our l strikes like that , one , two .now , we 're going to practice doing it in 360 's and changing up levels .what i mean changing up levels , i mean , going on to your knees , changing of levels , okay .so , that 's going to look a lot better instead of doing your whole form , standing up , switching directions , bam , changing levels , doing helicopter spins , alright .let 's go ahead and break that down .so , first , make sure you got your l strikes down with the correct spin and do helicopter spins , bam , bam ,okay , makes you go into a 360 , alright .now , let 's go and practice going on to our knee .okay .let 's go and face the direction of our right .so , drop on to one knee , we 're going to a first bout using our nunchucks , come together , knees together .okay , now , i 'm in an angle .i 'm going to face all the way to the back .bring one knee around , okay .now , i 'm going to drop that one back again , bring the other knee up to back to standing position , and stand .so , i did a complete 360.so , one more time , we 're going to go a little faster .drop one , two , three , four , alright .you must have that section down before moving on .now , do n't drop too hard and bang your knees .drop it real smooth .okay , you do n't want it choppy .now , we do it with nunchucks .we 're going to do l strikes , okay ?drop one , crisscross.
in this clip we 're going to speak about affirm relaxer .affirm is a relaxer that is been around a very long time .it 's from the company avlon and they have different types of relaxers .the fiberguard relaxer is very important because what it does is it goes ahead and brings back the elasticity into the hair , and when it is relaxed , you know the hair loses some elasticity , gets more porous .well what affirm has developed here in this , in this a great product is a formula that goes ahead and strengthens the hair after the relaxer .and.
hey there back again , some healthy tips for a good night sleep which we all can use for rejuvenation .big one is food allergies or even food sensitivities .you 'll be surprised how those can interrupt your sleep patterns or your sleep at all .the best thing to do is if you 're allergic to any of these type things , you know the soy , the diary , the gluten products , the nuts or the peanuts especially , shellfish , all of those that tend to be , people have food allergies to , even corn.

as a kid , i worked in the plaza with the famous danielle belair who was fanatically a great chef and probably one of the best in the world .he would be fanatical about this .always cleaning your plate up gives you a chance to taste it .but here 's a little way to make it look nice .just take a fork and just pat it down with a fork ; it gives it some nice lines .how much does this cost ?it 's pretty cheap to make .it 's only potatoes and eggs , your basic .this salad will probably serve 8 to 10 people for less than 15 bucks to make .i put a little sprig with parsley just like that in the corner .it gives it a little color .that 's it .it 's ready to go .here is how i store it too .simple storage is just cutting it like so .put this on top .you can store it in a tupperware .this will stay good for a week in your refrig .i do this on friday morning.
many ways i can show you where i actually incorporate a lot of the equipment .let me show you something really basic , really easy , so you have at least something to use no matter where you are .because you can take this even traveling , right ?alright , basic bicep curls .the key on this , is that you have enough resistance .i have a pretty hard tube , tight tube .so my feet are close together .so just curling up , with my elbows in , is pretty difficult .if this was a tube that perhaps was stretched out , i would have to step apart further .right ?i 'd have to step apart further to get more resistance .another variation on the bicep curl , would be to take it both , one arm .definitely difficult .i can also twist it where my thumb is on top , and i 'm coming up with a hammer curl .there 's a lot of variations .i can take it out to the side more .but this is your basic bicep curl with the tubing .lets move to tricep , which is the opposing muscle .and i 'm going to show you from the side .now , again , resistance is critical , it 's key .it depends where you step on the tubing .if i step closer to the handle , harder to do .if i step further away from the handle , easier to do .i 'm going to try just right in the middle to start .i 'm going to keep my elbow in , by my side.
so a little bit earlier on in some other series you might have seen me lift my pinky finger a little bit when i was first showing you the bow hold .this is just to show that the pinky finger is really a stabilizer.
we are going to now assemble the bell-hiller mixing mechanism .and amazingly enough , this is , most of these parts are parts you 're going to find on a full scale aircraft .and they 're absolutely necessary to the proper operation .you saw that i just put the shoe goop in these holes .there 's two bearings that go in here with this tiny , tiny brass washer between them .all absolutely necessary to the proper operation .i 'm going to go ahead , install the bearings .ok , i 've put the bearings in the bell-hiller mixing arms .i 've put the ball , the ball links on the ends , and it 's time to fasten it to the rotor head .now , once again , proper orientation is hugely important .look at the drawing , look at the picture .make sure your parts are in the same orientation and that everything looks exactly the same .if it does n't , somethings wrong .ok.i 've assembled the bell-hiller mixing arms to the see-saw , the flybar see-saw here .and then the last step here is to put on these ball links .now the drawing very specifically calls out 32mm .the best way to measure them is with the digital calipers , this 31.96.so that 's pretty close to 32 .31.90 , now actually , those are about as close as you 're going to get to 32 , because of the thread distances , if i screw it out a full turn it will be far in excess of that .so that 's about as close as we 're going to get .ok , i 'm going to use the ball link pliers to install these .once again , under the link , press down firm force , pops right on .make sure that these are in the proper orientation with the drawing , so that the arm is on the right side of the rotor head .pop on the second one , just like that .and then you can see how those interconnect and move together .i 'm going to do that to the other side , and then we 're going to move on with the assembly .

today i 'm going to help you look how to create an intention .what is an intention ?an intention is something that you seek out to have .an intention is something that you set forth .say we 're talking about golf , and of course brad is a top one hundred golf instructor in the country , so we will be talking to him in just a moment about the intention that he has set for himself regarding his golf game .so how you create an intention is you look at where you want to be , not where you 're not , where you wish you could be ,where you hope you could be , but exactly where you want to be .it all begins with believing that you can be where you want to be .that 's how you begin creating an intention .so brad , let , let me ask you , what intention do you want to create regarding your golf game ?well i want to be able to play competitive golf with not.

we 're going to talk about time stretching now .time stretching is applied when you have a sample that is a certain size.
let 's take a look .now , we 're going to learn this introductory phrase in two parts .now when the song begins , the bass starts playing .but when randy rhoads kicks in his guitar , this is the phrase that you play , okay ?so your index finger on the 2nd fret of the low e string , your ring finger on the 4th fret of the a string , then we 're going to use our pinkie to come to the 5th fret and come back off .okay ?we 're palm muting all of these , which means you just lay the side of your hand lightly against your strings ,okay ?we 're going to hit that low e string twice ,then to the 4th fret of the a , back to the e string , then to the 5th fret of the a string , back to the 2nd fret of the e string , 4th fret a string , 2nd fret e string .that phrase sounds like this .okay ?then the next phrase , we 're going to bring that index finger to the 2nd fret of the a string and kinda switch it around .we 're going to use the pinkie on the 5th fret of the e string and our ring finger on the 4th fret of the same string , where it 's going to go 2nd.
so in the final step of putting together our bunraku arm control , what i 've done is to bend two little pieces of wire , drill a couple of holes and stick them in there .and you can a drop of crazy glue to hold those in place .i 'm going to take some lengths cut intentionally a little extra long of the dacron cord .tie a square knot at the very least , that 's right over left , left over right to attach the string to those homemade little eye screws .and then i 'm going to thread my dacron through my brass tubes .already done the other one .this is number two .all the way down to the other end .i 'm going to pass it , whoops , pass it through from the underside .so from the same side that the ,and i 've put a little hot glue on that stubborn cotter pin you can see .wrap it around through that divot.
this is our ride cymbal stand .we 're going to set up this other arm , and we 're going to loosen here and then pull this arm all the way up.
we ? re going to discuss a little bit about romance and astrology and this does not necessarily mean that astrology can create a romantic situation .but , there has to be a certain amount of romance.
there 's four different types of fire you can learn , and use them in different scenarios .if you want to cook , the best fire for you is use the log cabin fire .this is really good , because the log cabin fire is really ventilated , so it gets a lot of oxygen , which helps put off more heat , but most importantly is the logs freely fall on top of each other as they burn , and they make really , really good pieces of coal that put off really good heat , to where you can transfer them ; put them on top of a dutch oven , up under it in a different location .second type of fire is a tepee fire .this is going to be great in case.
some desert dwelling animals like to burrow a little bit.
on stage , cast size is usually limited .we 'll look at some exceptions on this rule as well .in the modern theater , you usually want to have four to six characters in your play .that gives the actors a chance to have a meaty role .and also , if you 're a producing company , you want to get a play to where you 're probably not paying like 100 actors unless you 're on a broadway budget .in a cast size also to consider are the exceptions to the rule such as musicals or high school productions .it 's a big secret that musicals are probably the most lucrative form of theater ; they 're very spectacle orientated , and you can have a chorus line , and you can have all kinds of big events happening .and so , in musicals , you might require a lot a large cast.
and i might add -- go back and re-plop some red , but right now , i 'm just going to do a few big drops of white .not as many as the red 'cause i already have the whole piece of wood pretty much covered .so , i 'm just going to go with a few of the white plops.
in this clip we are going to talk about things to consider for families and students .if you have begun to look into home schooling that are considering teaching your own child at home , many times families do so in order to resolve an outside conflict .maybe there is a conflict at school or social problem or developmental problem with your child .maybe they need to learn patience or develop study skills .these are valid reasons why families might choose to teach their own children at home .you want to make sure you take into consideration hanging in for the process realizing that there are going to be things to work through.

here i have a pair of flared leg pants these are designed as jeans but the point of having flare legged pants is that is makes your legs look thinner .that 's one trick to minimize bigger legs.
now i 'll discuss starting your own teleprompter business .when i started my business in dallas , texas in 1986 , there was not a lot of competition .dallas was a booming town in our industry .conventions , shows , commercials , and a great deal of corporate work to be had as well .before i started my business , i researched the market need in my city and even in nearby cities and states .i discovered there were just two teleprompter companies in the dallas/fort worth area .and only one had a computerized teleprompter at the time .there certainly was room for me .that year i attended nab or national association for broadcasters convention , and looked at all the teleprompter software and hardware companies there .i decided on telescript.
today we 're going to do some demonstrations on how you can do creative coloring for your pet .we use completely safe nontoxic materials .one technique you will see we will wash off pretty much immediately .the other technique fades over time and it may take up to 6 weeks to wash off completely .okay , we 're back here with bella , our little yorkshire terrier , who 's actually grown to look a schnauzer .we had done her in the purple .you can see that on the darker hair , the purple really comes out almost like a highlight .then on the lighter coat , it comes out much more purpley .the deeper areas where we did n't work it in.
you can take a plant which starts out as a bulb and just put it in a jar which contains water .if you do n't have a special jar that really contributes to the growth of a plant , you can just take any little small container , throw some water in it and just put your bulb in that water.
we 're going to add on to our warrior sequence with a warrior 2 and a reverse warrior .from downward facing dog place the right foot next to your right hand in a low lunge .back heel on the floor .inhale by reaching the arms to the sky in a warrior 1.exhale open up into warrior 2.as you open up the left hip rotate toward the left side of the room if we 've got the right leg forward .important to keep the natural curve of the low back by blossoming the sit bones outward and the same time , very nice , pull the low belly in to counterbalance that action .then place the palm , right palm towards the sky inhale , and reach into a reverse warrior , very nice .keeping the front knee stable and the knee drawing towards your baby toe , the tendency is to collapse inward .can you show me a collapse for me debbie , yea on the knee ?really work to open that knee , strong base and a foundation .exhale both hands to either side of the leg , coming all the way back down into a downward facing dog .step forward with the left foot.
i love it .i 'm just going to drizzle that all over the top .the whole thing .again , fold it all in .i 'm going to just put that in nice and easy .this is going to be some nice salad .i 'm just going to toss all this up all together .we 're actually going to put it back in the refrigerator for about 25-30 minutes .let it coat .if you really wanted to serve it , you could serve it now .it 's just nice when you get this all mixed up and let all these flavors fuse together .please go out and make this .it 's a really good one .
now , the round ones that you have , you can do two things with them .you can either form a roll or a french roll , we call it .roll it like that.
there are many different drum sets , and when you 're a new time drummer , it can sometimes be very overwhelming because there 's so many different brands , so many different kinds of drum sets , it 's pretty crazy .but really it 's all about what kind of style of music you 're doing is what 's the best way to decide what kind of brand you want .there 's ibanez , the ludwig drum sets , but it all depends what style you 're doing .like if you 're getting in to a metal band you 'd want to get a bigger drum set , lots of toms and lots of cymbals do to all those fills and things like that .and a lot of times those are ibanez .for me personally in my band.
so here 's another red marker that shows us that we need to go up in this room .we can see that there is a portal-taking area up there , and that looks like pretty much it for the moment although we have a fan area up here .so maybe we should stop there first before we try to go all the way up .make our exit there and then entrance on the floor , we just hop right out .now we 're behind this fenced off area .and there 's a door.
chinese writing is very different from most other languages in the world .in the chinese writing system , chinese symbols represent each character which corresponds to a single spoken syllable .a majority of words in all modern varieties of chinese require two or more characters to write .many chinese characters were adopted according to their meaning by the japanese and korean languages to represent native words , disregarding pronunciation altogether .chinese characters are also considered to be the world 's longest continuously used writing system .
if they did , you would have sort of ground beef , ground turkey soup which would still be just as delicious .but this is the traditional way .so you just drop them in one by one to the broth .i kind of like to re-roll them a little bit.

schmuel : when you 're making great macaroni and cheese from scratch , you make a roux .and a roux is a thickener that 's made by mixing butter and flour together and cooking it.
alright , what 's a good `` p '' word ?oh we have so many wonderful words in calligraphy .`` proportion '' , obviously the word proportion , you know having to do with a relative size of things , plays a very , very important place , and you must be very aware of this .`` patience '' is a really important word , it definitely takes patience to learn this , tremendous amount of patience .so what i would advise you is to be patient with yourself .i do n't think that many people think that way , they think about being patient with others , or being patient with something .but what i 'm going to say is in order to learn calligraphy , this needs to be paramount , you need to be patient with yourself .
so the next , to start adding to our four way coordination with jazz is to add a third limb .and what i 'm going to add , is the snare drum .i 'm going to play quarter notes on the snare .meaning , i 'm going to play , one , two , three , four on the snare drum .then combine it , with what 's going on , on our jazz ride pattern and the hi hat .so i 'll just put a couple measures of just the jazz ride pattern , we 've been playing .and then , i 'll just adding in .i 'm not slamming down .this is n't rock , i 'm not playing rim shots over on the snare drum .i 'm.
the quality depends a lot on where you 're going to be using the table .what i mean by that is a commercial table is very heavy .it 's made of ; the bed of the table is made of slate so that it can take a lot of abuse , a lot of use , a lot of wear and tear .a home table is normally not going to get near the play that a commercial table gets so the slate or that is.
in this clip we 're going to talk about the proper service procedure to inspect , remove and replace you steel brake lines and bleed the braking system on a ford explorer .in this step we 're going to talk about some of the tools required in order to replace the steel brake lines on a ford explorer .as you can see i have a whole bunch of them here in front of me .i 'm just going to go over them with you .i have my floor jack for jacking the vehicle up off the ground .i have a small hand-held torch here and some oxygen and map gas .i 've got one line wrench .a set of line flaring tools , some unions my standard/metric socket set , magnetic tray , hammer .jack stands , i got a set of them one here one over there .my creeper because i do n't like laying on cold concrete .a couple of zip ties and my replacement lines and hose .those are the tools required in order to service your vehicle 's steel brake lines .
you have on and off buttons , you have a corresponding list of what you want to turn on and off , which controls a module , this is a switch module for the wall .now , we 'll get into the specifics a little later , but basically all it does is , when it gets a signal from the remote the receiver sends a signal to the switch and turns your light on and off or even dims it .now , the main part of this is your receiver , this receives a signal from the remote , goes into the receiver , thru the electrical in your house wiring to the lamp module or wall switch module and turns it on and off .that 's right , the signal first travels thru the air from this remote to the receiver once it gets into the receiver the signal travels thru your house wiring , all over your house , so where ever one of these sits you can have this plugged into your wiring anywhere in the house in about 30 feet away from the remote and it will work , so you can have these modules all over the house controlling lights , appliances , spas , saunas , whatever you want to turn on and off the extend system will do it .now , where can you get this system , just about any hardware store , well any descent hardware store or you can order it from the web , personally i went to ...
so again standing back to back , we are going to separate our feet about the length of one of her legs .we are going to turn back 45 degrees and our front foot is pointing forward .we are going to inhale and the tall person is going to bring their hands and their palm is down and the short person is going to bring their hand.
something i 've mentioned in past clips is that a lot of even numbered tricks involve crossing throws , much like you would throw in a cascade .so , what i 'm going to teach you now is basically a crossing pattern with four balls .this is essentially a five-ball pattern with a hole where the five ball would be .so obviously it 's much more easier to do because you 're only dealing with four objects and you can kind of cheat a little bit on the timing to learn .the site swap notation is 5 , 5 , 5 , 5 , 0.it looks like this .from an asynchronous turn , throw all four balls in a high cascade pattern .from that you can return directly to four balls .now try to get it down on both sides starting left handed , and then once you can do it a few times on each side , try to switch back and forth .as you can see , my hand ends up empty occasionally where that fifth ball would be .now this is a great drill for learning five balls , but also because you have to work with the cascade style throws , will prepare you for other tricks .
i 've been teaching 3 year olds up to 50 year olds for 20 years , so if there 's one thing i know , i know how to teach walking and turning on a runway .i 'd like to start with stepping up on the runway .you can practice this at home or anywhere that you have a step .so i 'm going to start right here at the side of the ramp.
your french upstroke is going to sound like this .your full .your downstroke .your american grip with the three strokes are going to sound like this .but keep in mind this is in the center of the drum .you can have the variations of rim-shots , off-center and the rim .we 're starting with the upstroke .lastly , here 's your german grip doing the upstroke , down stroke and the full stroke .again , the most important probably being the down stroke as this is where the drumming comes ahead.
something else that you need to keep in mind when you 're working with your horse.
so now this is where the real fun begins .is that this is making a test strip .and doing this is very important and again.
and , the first part to every bit of the fundamentals starts with base , and the strength at the support of your fundamentals , or your foundation .so , what we 're going to talk about right now is the stance , and the stance is very important on defense .it 's a little bit different than a shot , or something like that .if you 're a shooter , you 're going to be pretty much shoulder width apart , but if you 're a defensive player , you want to be a little bit wider.

okay , now that we 've got the gate hung on the hinges , we 're going to move on to the latch side .first item that we 're going to mount is the striker .here it is placed about chest height , which is just a matter of preference .if you do n't want kids to be able to open it , you can put it higher , or you can put it lower if you want them to be able to access it .make sure you get all your screws in nice and tight .and then grab the latch portion , and have one person hold it in place , with the gate in the close position , and line the striker up perfectly in the center , so the gate will be able to open and close freely , without binding on the latch .once you get the first two screws in , you can open your gate , and finish putting the rest of the screws in on the inside .
ok so you just got your iphone , or you actually just want to change some things around whether you have your phone unlocked.
in this clip , we 're going to take the single paradiddle and apply it to the drum set setting .okay ?and how it can help you in your drum set playing .it is a very efficient tool if you will that rudiment .some rudiments do n't really apply to the drum set setting or ca n't be applied to that setting as easily or as beneficial to your playing as the paradiddle .so let 's go ahead and take a look as to make the paradiddle work in the drum set setting to make you a better player .so , what we 're going to do is take a look at the basic drum beat with the basic drum fill , how you would alternate sticking or just regular .let 's take a look real quick .one , two , three and four and a one .so that would be a drum fill and a one we just hit.

i 'm here at everything peaceful in wilmington , north carolina .i 'm here to discuss what is transverse friction massage .transverse means to go across and friction means to just apply pressure to the muscle underneath the skin .so transverse friction massage is basically moving the skin with your fingers transversally over muscle fibers or across the muscle fibers .and basically the point of doing that is to break up any adhesions or muscle knots in the tissue , increase circulation and therefore , increase flexibility of that muscle .and any time that you bring circulation to a muscle , you 're going to decrease the problems that it has as far as pain and discomfort ; things like that .so basically to perform transverse friction massage , you bring the joint into full range , in to full stretch .and then take your fingers and just move across those muscle fibers .and that 's transverse friction massage .
now we 're getting into stuff that 's closer to you .so the closer it is the darker and the more dense what you 're going to be able to see because the reason why this stuff looks so soft in the background is because you 've got the atmosphere.
hello welcome back.
every monologue or song , you want to show a journey .this is how you can really show that you 're an actress who could n't pull off an entire play .i mean , acting is about a journey .it 's about just watching a character go from one moment to another .so , in `` shy '' from `` once upon a mattress , '' for example , my journey is that i start out really shy and neurotic , but.
an essential piece of equipment in sharpening your turning tools is going to be a bench grinder .this is a two speed grinder .it operates at a slow speed and a high speed , but i almost exclusively will operate this bench grinder at the lower speed which is about seventeen hundred fifty rpms .it has two wheels and they 're eight inch wheels .this is a sixty grit wheel and i use this wheel if i have to do any reshaping of my tools , and this is an eighty grit wheel and this is a wheel that i will use when i need to just put a fresh edge , or fresh cutting edge , on my tool .it comes with some after market pieces of equipment that are underneath , mounted underneath the wheels , and they 're made , they 're called the wolverine jigs .the wolverine jig are these two sections that are mounted right beneath the two grinding wheels , and on one side we have a flat tool rest that slides in and out , and under this one a v-arm that slides in and out .
i 'm a dental assistant with solutionz.
it 's energetic and it 's fast paced .i like to use bunny when the energy in the room is getting bogged down .when people seem to be getting shy or self conscious .we play bunny .and people start giggling and feeling really silly .and things can get rolling .so i would n't do this with a bunch of complete strangers .but with a group of people who have a little bit knowledge of each other .and need a little energy boost .and here is , how it works .we 'll be in a circle , in a room .and one person is going to start .and they 're going to be the bunny .and they go like this .now i never decided , is this bunny whiskers or is it bunny teeth .that 's up to you .that 's a thing , you can decide .they 're going to go like this .bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny .there 's going to be someone on their left .that person is going to be their bunny ears , on this side .and they 're going to be going , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny .the other person on their right , who is the other side 's bunny ears .and they 're going to be going , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny .so you can imagine , there 's three people here all going , bunny ,bunny .yeah , there 's this bunny , bunny .and this bunny , bunny .and so every one is going , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny .and the person in the center , when they 're ready .they throw the bunny to someone across the circle .and that person becomes the bunny .and the people on either side of them , become the bunny ears .so it 's this real , fast pace , silly thing .so it 's really hard to demonstrate by myself .but i 'm going to do a little try at this .and i 'm going to look , especially silly .bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny .bunny .and if that was me .bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny , bunny .bunny .like that and so on and so forth .that is the basic structure of bunny .it is just fast and silly and fun .it 's important to go fast or else.

m going to show you how to make a cute little bag out of regular everyday fabrics .in this next step we 're going to sew together our bag .the outside of our bag .so you can see that i left it exactly how it was on the cutting table .i have the right sides pinned together and i have a half an inch seam allowance .and i like to use just a regular old simple stitch .if you have a good machine and you do n't really need to do an exaggerated heavy stitch you can just use a simple stitch .also the fact that we have a lining means that it 's ok for not using a big crazy stitch on the outside because we have a lining .so everything that goes in the bag is going to be in the lining .it 's going to take some weight off of the outside of the bag.
for another edged weapon attack or defense from a straight stab we 're going to go to the inside now .and we 're going to look at another disarm .we 're going to use the same principle .off line as always .this time i 'm going to attack the inside of the forearm .it 's where i naturally am .and i 'm also going to attack the wrist as well .it 'll be simultaneous .obviously it 's pretty physically complicated to a degree .but i want to keep the motions nice , short and sweet and to the point .my goal is to strike this here .cause stretching of the tissue and then cut down to the wrist and as i do that i 'll begin to get a nice bend in the wrist .so as daniel comes in .boom .start to stretch it out .hold on to it .we 'll do it nice and slow .here , just like this .now , as he comes in .by striking here.

today we 're going to learn a couple old school tricks .now the term old school just refers to tricked that were originated in the mid to late 80 's , early 90 's , usually have a lot of flair , just real smooth surfer kind of style influence , cruising tricks .one of the first tricks that was originated in the streets and on ramps is something called a power slide .you have a front side power slide when you 're actually facing the direction that you 're sliding and you 'll slide with your wheels in a direction like this .it 's just being light on the toes and back in the day they had soft wheels , and just power slide and make a lot of noise , have a lot of fun .you can , you know , put your hand down and make it a little more stylish , whatever you prefer .then you have the back side power slide .back side power slide is when you 're sliding , your back is facing the direction that you 're going , once again , you 're just sliding your wheels along the ramp light on your feet , just kind of putting your own style on the trick .another old school trick would be the bean plant , and the bean plant , you 're just going to cruise up to any surface , it could be a sidewalk , it could be an embankment , it could be flat ground , you 're then going to take one foot off , one foot on , and do a hop , and land back on your board , grabbing the board right in the center .i 'll now demonstrate how to do a front side power slide , back side power slide , and a bean plant .and that 's how to do old school tricks .

one of the tools that i use , and you 'll use a lot is a hand spreader .now , you definitely do n't want get out the great big spreader to put out some seed or to put a little bit of fertilizer in an area where something ?s starting to look yellow .if you 've got something like this , it usually has a little handle and you 're going to apply it .it evenly applies it , and it 's easy to work with .it only holds about five pounds .five pounds is easy to handle .if you start working with something that handles hundreds of pounds , you better have your tractor or you better eat your wheaties to help get it across that area .if you 've got a small area , the little hand spreader is a tool that you 'll use on a regular basis.
ok , our next step is going to be to label all the parts of the chair .this is an extremely important part of this process because if you do n't label them , later when the chair is in pieces , you 're going to get confused about what goes where .as you can see , all these spindles look alike , but they 're not alike in the way they join into the parts of the chair .so each spindle has to go back where it was to begin with .what we do is take a roll of masking tape and write on it .as you can see , this chair is already labeled .write on the tape right front , left front , these are the front legs .these spindles are labeled front one and front two going from top to bottom and all labeling is going to be done as you stand in front of the chair and look at it .now what i like to do is put my labels to the right side so that now i know this spindle is the front spindle on top.
okay .now we are going to start marking .with the fingers , with -- you can mark like this because as you 've seen in the pictures , those feathers , they are long .the feathers that are there in the end of the neck and they start in the chest and in the back .they are long feathers .then , do these kind of long strokes like this.
how often you should replace your furniture .i believe on couches , on sofas , you should replace your furniture every three to four years .the reason why , is because of foam .the foam on the inside of the couches starts wearing down again , because you 're sitting down all the time , so i believe that every three to four years you should go ahead and change your couch , and it will have that nice fresh feel so that you can have that comfort back in your seat , basically in your seat .okay , that also should go for your mattress .about every five years you should change your mattress .that 's another unit.
hi there , and welcome to the wonderful world of washing clothes .we have been talking about washing your colored clothes , gone through some steps about sorting , about pre-treating , about prioritizing , everything to keep your colors looking great .after you 've done washing , the next step , the logical step , is going to be drying .but there 's a couple things i need you to do before you go on to drying .first is inspect your clothes .what are you looking for ?you are looking for stains .you really do n't want to move on to drying with a stain in your clothes .it 's very important to check front and back and get those stains out while they are still damp .you do n't want your beautiful colored shirts to be ruined by stains .also look for bleeding .we have taken every precaution for that not to happen , but sometimes it just happens .again , you want to catch it while it 's still damp .you do n't want to get it into that dry mode .so go through everything , take a lot of care with your colors .it 's important to look at your clothes while you take them out of the washer .just give them a good looking over .this will help preserve your clothes and that 's what we 're all about .we 're helping to keep your clothes , and especially your colors , bright .
hi , i 'm terri , and in this segment we 're going to be doing how to twist hair .now there 's many different styles you can do for twisting hair .now with the type of hair that angela has , i 've done a few small twists here , but i think what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to show how to do a large roll twist .so , we 're going to start at the top , and we 're going to take small ...a small segment like this .and we 're just going to roll it in , twist it in .and do it fairly tight so that it does n't get too loose and start to fall out .and then what we 're going to do is we 're going to slowly add pieces , and roll them in , or twist them in .and keep taking , and twisting them in .all right .and then once you get down to the nape of the neck.

and we 're going to take it out of its rind.
scoring systems in pinochle , there are three , actually three primary ways that scoring is accomplished in the game .it does n't matter which one as long as you know what scoring system is going to be employed .progressive scoring , progressive scoring combines the add on feature and the use of not having the subtraction option but having the add on feature .let 's look for an example .supposing the opponents have bid sixty-five and they do have the required twenty meld and let 's just say that we happen to have twenty-two meld which is very important .let us suppose that they only had thirty meld , this is thirty meld right here .now they obviously have to pull the difference between thirty meld and sixty-five , they have to pull thirty-five counters .again , here 's the relationship between this and this .they have thirty meld , they have bid sixty-five , and they need thirty-five counters , thirty-five out of a possible fifty available in the play of the hand .if they fall short , if they fall short , they do n't get that thirty-five , right , then they have lost their bid and their bid goes over to our score .now if they only pulled say thirty counters.
the next stretch that we 're looking at is the cobra , or at least that 's what it 's referred to in yoga .it 's , you can do an elbow cobra , and what you 're trying to do is , you 're trying to keep your back straight , and you 're trying to cut yourself at your lower back , and trying to open up your abdomen , your hips , and trying to get some blood flow going through into your quadriceps , and through the major veins and arteries of the front of the body .now if you find yourself fairly flexible , try to come up even higher .but if your hips are coming up off the floor because of it , go back down , you 're not flexible enough yet to actually get there .but the more flexible you become , the more you can start working with it and trying to get your body to relax .so i 'm not quite at the point of being able to grab my feet ,but i can relax enough to keep my hips on the floor and keep everything relatively loose and easy going .stretch forward just to help stretch the shoulders out a little bit , bend the neck and the head , and try to continue relaxing the lower back , and that pelvis down , keep your shoulders light and relaxed .
so what is an interview .well a job interview is a formal meeting between a potential employee and employer or a potential employer .the job interview has two purposes .for the employer , it is to find the best person that is suited for that job .for you , the employee , it is an opportunity to find the best job that suits your needs and this happens through a series of questioning and exchange of information .now , when you 're getting ready to start looking for a job , especially if you are in college .sometimes college kids start as early as nine months , looking for a job , because the job interview process is actually quite lengthy .i 'm going to give you some quick statistics .for every ten jobs you interview , that 's the average , you 'll interview for ten jobs , in order to get one .so we really want to brush up your interviewing skills .you may go on a average of twenty to thirty job interviews before you find the right job for you , that wants to hire you .so fasten your seat belts , here we go .

in this clip we will be talking about the time signatures that are less common .they will include 5/4 , 9/8 , and 12/8 .so the first 5/4 is a time signature that can be divided up into either 2 3 or 3 2 , and it refers to whether it 's 2 3 or 3 2 depends on the piece and the music and the feeling of the music will define whether or not it 's a 2 3 or a 3 2 , and this can come up with a couple of different time signatures , and it will say a little 3 2 above the time signature .so , the 5/4 and a 2 3 pattern would be down , left , right , right , up , down , left , right , right , up .and then , a 3 2 would be down , left , left , right , up , left , left , right , up .so , that 's usually how you 'll do it , and it will say it in the score above the time signature if it 's a 2 3 or 3 2.the next is 9/8 , and that is one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine ; one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine ; and it 's pretty straightforward .12/8.

now the next thing i want to talk about you might not even realize that you do it because some people just tend to be this way .now what i 'm talking about is avoiding an abusive tone .tone of voice says a whole lot .it can sometimes even say more than the words that we choose .so when you 're making a criticism , you do n't want to get a nasty tone or even a loud tone or any kind of irritated tone .watch your tone .because sometime your tone can be even more attacking .i , i did n't , i did n't like the way you did that .o.k .you chose the correct words .i did n't like .i made it about me but my tone is still very harsh and still very criticizing .so no matter how difficult it is , you 've got to pick a nicer tone when delivering criticism .

where in the heck can you buy and try ginjo sake ?what i like doing is i like pressing the ownership and the responsibility of buying and maintaining sake on the restaurants .one of my favorite things to do is to go to restaurants and try multiple brews in that restaurant before i go and purchase a bottle by themselves .now a lot of restaurants will move sake in the form of flights .they will actually have a little flight of three different brews , a ginjo , a daiginjo and a junmai , let 's say .but what i recommend if you want to start exploring and trying sake , definitely go to your local sushi restaurant , and you 'll know that they 'll have i , and then try to go to more cutting edge , western restaurants that might introduce sake on the menu as well .now if you 're in a place that does n't have a lot of sushi , you 're kind of out of luck ; what you 're going to have to do is you 're going to have to come.

so you take your sponge , and you 're going to have to get it wet , and then you 're just going to take your glaze , and you 're going to dunk it in the glaze , and offload it on the side of the bucket .you can even squeeze it if you like , although i do n't have gloves on .you probably want to wear gloves , and you want to take the part of the sponge , that has the texture , and we 're just going to put it around the wall , and the thing about sponging , that you need to overcome , that i think is not very attractive , is if you just do that sort of thing , so you want to be softer , blend it , have some movement .i 'll wipe that off , but not a lot , and you just move the paint around , and you can do this with multiple colors .start with one color , and today , since we 're using sort of a camel tone , you could use taupe ,a linen white , brown , and that is pretty much what sponging looks like .it 's very easy , it 's very quick , but you really need to pay attention , to not forcing the sponge on the wall , because you 'll get what i think , is just a sponged , not very sophisticated look .that is sponging , and i 'm lorna campodonico .
hi , i 'm travis corpening , and i 'm about to teach you , just how to do a reverse layup .here we are at carolina beach recreation center , and the first thing you want to do , when you 're trying to do a reverse layup , is you want to be able to jump from one side of the goal , at least to the other side of the rim , so once you take off , you want to position yourself to where , when you 're taking off , you 're already prepared , before you even jump .you 're all ready prepared , to make it , on the other side of the rim .now , by preparing yourself before you get to the other side of the rim , what you do is , you allow yourself more time to adjust to the defense , to have your mind and body adjust to the defense , for whatever may happen , while you 're in the air , so that you can complete the shot , so what you do , is you take off , reach with your opposite hand .if you 're coming from the left side of the basket , you want to complete it with your right hand .if you 're coming from the right side of the basket , you want to complete it with your left hand , but you can interchange , if you 're skilled enough .after you come from the other side of the basket , you want to reach around , and you either want to spin it , or you want to tap it , right in the middle of the box , over the top of the rim .once you do this , practice it a few times , and it 's a really effective shot , during the game , when you 're in a tight squeeze , and the defense is really playing you down low .there you have it , the reverse layup .
because this is one thing that you can not fake at all .sincerity is one thing that you have to have it.

so lets take a minute , to familiarize ourselves , with the equipment that came with our at home drug testing kit and just get an idea of what each piece is supposed to do and the purpose of everything .we 've already seen the at home question and answer , test instruction handbook , which is a , much more in depth piece of text than i have let on so please , always be sure to read instructions thoroughly , when using an at home health product .this is the at home urine collection kit , as you can see it is approximately one-hundred milliliter cylinder and the strip , at the bottom , is very important .this is a temperature strip , and in a freshly produced sample , it will generate a temperature between ninety and one-hundred degrees fahrenheit , representing the fact that the urine has just come from a body of regular temperature .if you were to collect a sample from somebody else who may or may not be messing with a sample , anytime the urine leaves your particular custody , you have no way of knowing if it 's been dumped out or swapped in and commonly people will obtain urine from a person they know , to be absolutely clean and free of any sort of illegal or prescription drugs and try to swap it in , for their own .what this temperature strip will tell you is , whether or not the urine has come fresh from the body or is cold , due to the fact that it has been out of somebody else 's body , for a while .the color green , in the strip , equals that the sample that temperature and if the sample is tan , on the strip , then that means that the sample has dropped below one degree fahrenheit and it could possibly not be your test subjects sample .right here we have the at home test strip .one , two , three , four , five .one is methamphetamine and/or ecstasy , two is amphetamines , three is thc , which is the active ingredient in marijuana , four is cocaine and five is opiates , which are again heroin or any number of prescription pain killing medication .this test is timed , so once it 's dipped , you 'll see that there is a mark to tell you when the result is ready.
okay , let 's learn a new finger pattern now .we 'll call this finger pattern 2.it 's the first few notes of the minor scale , so we can get into playing that .we 're going to go over the note names , and remember to keep playing with a nice steady tone .on the g string , our pattern is going to be the g , a again , with our first finger , and now we 're going to use our second finger to play b flat .so you hear the difference ; here 's the first pattern , and here 's the second one .one way you can check your pitch on.
alright so now we 've got to get back to that japanese tea cup from yesterday .i 'm going to show you how to make a clay chuck , just in case you do n't have the extra two hundred dollars to buy a giffin grip .alright.
well now we 're going to bring you to what everybody dreams of becoming.
you want this to sit in a very relaxed way this is really tight.
and when you do , you take a deep breath in and then tilt your head up.
alright let 's talk to f major scale .you 're going to be up in the side keys , high , real heavy again just like the last time .starting on f we will just go through the fingerings .it starts off with the low f , g , a , b flat , c , d , e , f , your middle f , f , g , a , b flat , c.
okay , our last cue ball action that we can use in conjunction with the tangent line is backspin .backspin is nothing more than the same spin that we put on the cue ball when we were using a draw shot .but , now on our draw shot , that was when the two balls were lined up straight for a straight in shot , we could get the cue ball to come straight back to us .but what happens when we 're at an angle like this ?we already know that we ca n't get the cue ball to come straight back because of the angle .so , what 's going to happen here.
i would like to show you a couple of examples real quick of a good corner and a bad corner .a good corner would be when the two edges meet and they line up.
hello .i 'm here to tell you how to create a really relaxing atmosphere for your massage therapy clients .now the first thing that you can do is you can set candles up and light them , and dim the lights .this is a really relaxing way to , first of all , just set a relaxing atmosphere .it kind of softens the mood , and helps people really , really relax .the second thing you can do is , of course , to dim the lights and set soft music .now , of course , your choice of music is going to be appropriate for relaxation .you 're not going to set ,like , the ramone 's up , or nirvana , or anything like that .you 're going to set really nice , relaxing music .and you can find any of this type of music in any bookstore , or , of course , used record store .the third thing that you can do is you can use an aroma therapy room spray .now this is one of my favorites .what you like ...
so you have access to everything here .we 're going to start with the body here.
the light really effects how visible texture is .so right now you can see i 'm using a very hard light.
the next category of herbs were gon na talk about is the aromatics .the aromatics work because they have volatile oils .they have oils that make them hot , make them exciting .capsicum is well known as cayenne pepper , you know you go to the mexican restaurant , and its like.
what we 're going to start with is we 're going to start with square piece of paper , it does n't have to be yellow .you can use whatever you want .and as you can see , i 've already got this pre-creased here .and i 'm going to show you what i did to get it to this point .what you 're going to do is you 're going to start off by folding your paper into thirds .and how you do that is you just bring this side over until this length is equal to this length .now , as you can see mine is just a little bit off .but , that 's fine .fold it this way in thirds .and then once you have your lines there you can just take this side and fold it straight into that line which will give you your third over here .and do the same thing here on your horizontal side .on your horizontal side we 're doing it the same way .now after you have that , you 're going to have this checkerboard shape here .what you 're going to do is you 're going to take your point corners and bring them in to the edge of your line here .you 're going to do that on all four sides , all the way across .and then you 'll have this checkerboard this way .basically , you folded your paper into thirds on your diagonal side .now that you have this , what you 're going to do , is you 're going to take.
the smart tool with the audio is very important .it definitely helps you affect all the audio in the right way.
we have got our lid ready to go so.
and what we are going to demonstrate and talk about is how to clear the obstructed airway .the obstructed airway can be cleared by using the finger sweep technique .before we attempt any type of finger sweep technique we have to determine if the airway is actually obstructed .the first thing we would do is tilt the head using the chin lift technique and try to deliver rescue breathes after we look , listen and feel to determine if the victim is exchanging air .if they are not exchanging air because of an airway obstruction , we would deliver two rescue breaths like forcefully , pinching off the nose and covering the patient 's mouth and blowing air down through the airway .if air will not go through we would reposition the head unless we suspect a spinal cord injury .if there is a spinal cord injury we would leave the head in the position found and use the jaw thrust technique of reaching into the mouth , grabbing under the chin , grabbing the tongue and pulling the jaw and the tongue forward , towards the feet .we would then look inside the airway to see if we see the obstruction and if we see the obstruction , take a finger and do a blind finger sweep through the mouth and the airway to try and eliminate the obstruction .then try and deliver rescue breaths once again .activate the emergency response system and wait for arrival of responding emt 's and paramedics .i 'm captain joe bruni , stay safe and we will see you next time .
we reviewed how to get out of a fire.
, we 've beveled the edges of the holes , and we 've hit every surface with the cutting tool , and now for the last step of cutting we 're going to do the edges .and i talked about it before .as you get the polish on , if you have a sharp edge like this , the more you polish , the edge is really going to become actually sharp .you 're going to cut yourself .so what you want to do with the edges is , if you want a smooth edge like this , rather than a rounded edge , you could still do it.
donna , have you ever worked on a cruise ship ?[ i would love to work on a cruise ship !how do you get hired ?and what are they looking for ? ]well , there 's not a trick to it .i have to tell you , i loved working on a cruise ship .i felt like it was a job.
we 're going to be working on shoulder development as well as some core strength.
now , how could you possibly teach someone how to make art ?does n't it just spring from the primordial ooze deep in my soul ?no , it 's not true .in fact , there are some techniques that you can learn for how to make great art .most artists want to tell you `` i do n't know how it happened '' because they generally do n't ; they 're incredibly talented and they usually find the intuitive part of their brain to connect with and that , that part of the right brain which never informs us of how we do it ; it just brings out an idea.
for this i 'm going to stand up on my toes , if you 're trying to do this move in tap dancing shoes or any kind of dance shoes that are not irish dance shoes , you might want to go out and get a pair of irish dance shoes and come back because for this you need the toe piece to be able to stand on your toes .so what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to stand on my toe and then roll up.
so you are going to start with putting the powdered green tea in to the cup .i am going to put about 3 tablespoons worth in to a small cup .then the next step is to dissolve with a little bit of water .so basically what we are doing , we are actually treating this almost like as at an espresso shot because we are going to be pouring steamed milk in to here .so make sure it is well dissolved .i am going to take my milk and pour into the pitcher .make sure you only put enough milk for what you are going to use .it is really important to actually steam the milk like you are doing a latte .you want it to be really liquidity , do n't want to have it foam up too much .when it gets to the point that it is unbearable to hold with one hand under the pitcher , that is when its reached its optimal temperature .make sure your steamer is clean .then i like to just stir it a little bit more .then we pour slowly into the middle .it is a little bit harder to make art in the matcha green tea latte then with a regular latter but you can defiantly achieve so .there you go .and that ?s a matcha green tea latte .
so if you decided a different seat would work better for you the first step is obviously removing your seat .the seat post that we have on this bike is made by a company names thompson the fairly standard design where you have 2 bolts holding everything on .you can see by changing which bolt is tighter you can change the tilt adjustment .to fully remove the seat what you have to do is unscrew one of these bolts until it is fully undone and you can see that way i could slide a new seat right on without much trouble .the thing to remember when you are taking your seat off.
so for two inches , you 've got one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine .so that would be nine stitches over two inches .most patterns call for ten centimeters , or four inches .so it would be eighteen stitches to four inches .i like to try to do it a couple times , like measure up here , measure down here in the swatch just to get an accurate representation .and again , what you want to do with your fabric is do n't pull it too tight one way or the other .but it 's best to steam it and pull it.
okay , resources ; what do you need to improve your game ?you 're going to need some tennis balls , you need a racquet , but i think you need a concept of the game .so , trying to find a coach will help .if you 've got somebody in your family like a parent , a brother or a sister to practice with .getting these nerf balls so you can hit against the wall , and also tennis balls and find a good wall to practice against .but when you go on the internet , there 's a lot of great resources and there 's a lot of videos you can watch to watch the great pros technique ; how they do stuff .you want to get fitter .you want to join the usta and get tennis magazine .if you do stuff like that , you 'll start reading and watching and knowing th game better and better .plus you 'll enjoy it more .so , if you ever go to a pro tournament , that 's unbelievable to watch the pros play and practice and of course , there 's a lot of matches on television .so , the most important thing is to just get out and start hitting ; whether it 's drop and hit or whether it 's hitting the wall .try to find a good coach ; somebody that you like working with and then find some other people to practice with.
alright .now we 're ready for capital letter b where we 're going to talk about date , year , time of day and season .again , go through the script .these are not assumptions .these are specific statements within the script about the year the season the time of day .for example , i have page two .tab over , quotations `` it began one monday last month with hester 's visit .
hello , my name is hector inga , owner of lane four swim shop in austin texas .i wanted to talk to you about girls ' swim goggles .these are girl specific , speedo makes a junior hydro specs , however they started making them in the pretty color for the girls , like this one is in pink , they also come in the metallic finished lens , also have the junior futurity you see in the coral color , tear has swimple in this pretty color as well , and finesse also makes a goggle with a pink gasket .all these companies found a need to make more feminine colors also for kids , they were making woman goggles so they decided to also get into the arena of the youth girl goggles .and it 's very popular , as you know the female population is the population that spends the most , or likes to go shopping the most.
yeah ,and this is the three dimensional way of doing t-shirts .i 'm gon.
i 'm going to use the gray one because it 's less messy .then i 'm going to put this away .we have here this --let me tell you that this project , it 's really a very good project also to do with the sculpey.
what do you need to play baseball ?well , let 's look inside the bat bag and find out .bat bag is the number one thing you 'll find every serious baseball player has .it 's an easy way to get your equipment to and from the game .first thing you need , obviously a baseball .this is a standard baseball .they 're all pretty much the same .you 'll need a glove .gloves come in various sizes .we 'll talk about that a little bit later .this is just a standard outfielder 's glove here .you 'll need some cleats .these will help you to navigate the field of play , help you dig in on the dirt a little bit better so you wo n't slip and slide .these are an optional piece of equipment for your batting gloves .these help you get a better grip on the bat .some people wear them under their fielding glove to add a little bit more padding .they 've got a nice , sticky surface here.
now , i 'm.
what i am going to show you know is the difference between an in and an out .so were going to take out three pieces .make sure there good and separated and were going to over just as before .just keep going over and make sure we collect all that hair and as you can see with the in braid its rather difficult because you do have.
and this is actually a white building .now , how did we create this pink glow ?somebody said to me when the exhibition opened , that i must of used a pink filter .no .this was shot in the middle of the summer , during a thunderstorm .and the thunderstorm had just cleared over the building , and most of the sky was pretty dark .but just as the sun was going below the horizon , it just popped out , hit the underside of cumolonimbus clouds , and reflected onto the building , creating this amazing pink glow .so do n't be scared when the weather is bad to go out and shoot , you might get some amazing results .this photograph was taken with the telephoto lens , actually this lens here , a 100 to 400 cannon image stabilize lens .the essence of this , is that you need to go out during inclement weather conditions to create unusual photographs .do n't be scared to go out when the sun is not out .
now if you 're talking about using a hose end sprayer , well this is one you might try to think about .its got different attachments and you can actually kind of change the dial a little bit to make sure you use different patterns for your plants .you normally do n't want to go in there with a gully washer .you know something that 's going to blow the poor plant out of the container .this happens to be a good one where you 've got an on and off little switch here , so if you have to put the hose down you can .in fact most communities today , if you do n't have some type of an on and off switch well , the water police can sometimes you give you a ticket .so it 's good to make sure you 've got this on and off valve on your hose end sprayer .i know you think if you 've got your hose.
seated at the desk , just use the spine aligner and roll feet over the ridges , you can also do it standing if you 'd like , but if your balance is n't stepping we recommend you do it seated .this way you 're massaging all of the reflexology points in the bottom of the foot which coincidently also correspond to all of the meridians and organs in the body .every meridian in the body has an ending point on the bottom of the feet , so this way you 've got all of these different points on the bottom of your feet and it feels fantastic .
alright the drink we are about to make is the flaming rasta .so you want to have some reggae music going on in the background while you make this drink or while you drink it.
now , let  s talk about the hardness of the bullets we are casting .this bullet here was cast with a combination of wheel weights , tin , and antimony .what you can do is get the blend that you need from a commercial source to use with your wheel weights .this will make your bullets harder .this bullet here has more lead content in it .i can tell by being able to scratch the surface of the bullet.
in this segment i 'm going to talk about controlling a swing .to swing only as big as you can control .for example , if you were trying to hit a nail into a wall and with a swing or a hit this big , you bent the nail , bent the nail , bent the nail.
what you use for this game is some kind of soft , cush , caterpillar gummy kind of toy that 's really hard to hurt anybody with , because they 're going to be flying around the room .lots of them are , and something that 's easy to catch .it has a nice sticky texture .so something like this is good .what 's going to happen when you start.
you will be able to manage your anger better .also , every cell of the body will be oxygenated with oxygen .you will be able to have a calm , cool , collected mind , and anything we do with this state of mind always comes out beautiful .the other plus benefits are , one is less susceptible to coughs , colds , asthma , and even bronchitis by doing the complete yoga breath .also , the additional benefit is both lobes of the brain , that is the right and the left , become balanced .so these are the benefits , now just a line of precaution , only one precaution , breathe through the nose .thank you .
are your wrists killing you at the end of a long day 's work ?maybe you drive a car , grab onto a steering wheel all day .maybe you work at a keyboard all day , cash register .maybe you 're a musician .if so , you might suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome .in carpal tunnel syndrome we 're using our wrist muscles rather than using all the other muscles in our arms , and so all the pressure goes to our wrist .we end up with an inflame medial nerve .one of the things that we can do is to try to stretch and use the other muscles and bring more blood flow into the wrist .so using a simple wrist circle is a great way to bring blood flow into the wrist .if you 're just in a seated comfortable position and bring your arms forward .you want to tuck your thumbs in and then bring the fingers around your thumb .bring your hands together and just begin to circle , keeping the hands together and keeping the elbows straight .do n't bend your elbows and allow your shoulder blades to sink down your back .you 'll also feel this in your shoulders 'cause what we 're trying to do is work our shoulder muscles .as you rotate in one direction , you want to rotate in the other direction .and this is going to stretch the tendons in the forearms and also bring more blood flow for your wrists and hopefully soothe some of your wrist pain .i 'm cindy mastry , namaste .
hello everybody , how are you ?he 's here to join us to help us move it along .well first we 're going to talk about action and movement .now juan as a stuffed figure , he has to animate himself.
it is true that japanese people say `` sorry '' a lot .i did it , too .so here are two important words you need to know , especially going to japan .the first word is `` i 'm sorry '' :gomen nasai .repeat after me :gomen nasai .sounds good .be careful with those two `` n '' s right here , try to separate them .the first word `` gomen '' is sorry .and `` nasai '' adds politeness to it .gomen nasai .sounds good .second one is `` excuse me '' .sumimasen .sounds good .now we use `` i 'm sorry '' or `` excuse me '' - gomen nasai , sumimasen - instead of `` thank you '' , because we think the other person did all the trouble for you ; therefore you want to apologize to them .but actually means thank you .for example , you give me a gift , i will say , `` domo sumimasen '' .`` domo '' is `` oh ...
first you have to decide what you want.
one of my favorite places to see one day when i get the opportunity is the great asian countries .the scenery is just wonderful , especially in shenzhen and guangzhou .if you want to book train travel from this selection , this area of shenzhen to guangzhou the first thing i suggest you do is go through a qualified travel agent .that 's because when you get to asian countries the language is a bit hard to interpret , and if you go through a travel agent you 're likely to get a good deal .although it might be a little more expensive than buying your ticket directly at the counter , once you get to the station , they 'll be able to speak to you in english and give you some good qualified advice on how to do this travel .now , the trip only lasts a little over an hour , but it 's a wonderful trip .when you get to the station follow the english signs .there are english signs everywhere , so that 's going to make things very easy for you .follow the english signs .now , it is suggested that in and around these areas in the train stations that you keep aware of your surroundings , and keep your luggage and handbags very close by , but the best advice i could give you in booking this travel via rail ; it 's a short trip , a fun trip , but definitely go through a qualified travel agent to make sure that you get the most for your money .i 'm russ handler , and that 's how you do it .
ok , so here we have our , our vase , and it has , been on the drying rack for a few days , and as you can see , it 's come off the wheel .so , we know it 's ready to trim .if you had trouble getting it off the wheel , you might want to draw a wire under again , using the same method as we did before .now , the first thing you want to do when you 're trimming , is check , and if you can get your hand in there , check to see how much clay you have on the bottom .so , i 've done that .we have about half an inch .and now , what we 're going to want to do , is prepare a bat , to trim , this part .and , this really is a big time saver , if you ask me .you want to take care of as much of the work as possible .preparation is ninety percent of the game , as , as it always is .and what i like to do is take a pencil and a bat , and draw myself some concentric lines .now , they make different kinds of bats for trimming .you can get bats that have piece of carpet on top , or felt , so that you can put a part on that does n't slip around .they also make what 's called the giffen grip , which has three points that close in on itself .so , another concern when throwing a , a vase like this , is how sturdy your top edge is , because we 're going to be turning it over on to that edge .now , on this one you can see , i have a nice thick , strong , top to it .so , i 'm going to be able to turn this over and simply place it on to the bat .if we had more of a delicate neck , i would want to throw what 's called a chuck , and you can find out more about chucks in other series , in , within other lessons of this series .but first , i 'm going to take my pot here , and turn it over ,and then i 'm going to match it up with those lines.
now we are going to clean the blinds .this will take you a little longer obviously because you are going to go through every blind individually.

once your child has mastered being able to identify the numbers 1 through 10 , make another chart with the numbers 1 through 20.once they can count 1 through 20 and they can also identify 18 without counting up , then they can start counting things around the house .make counting a lot of fun , take out some beans out of a jar , have them count the beans .take a loaf of bread and let 's count how many slices are in there .take the eggs out , have them count the eggs .have them count how many shirts they own .how many socks , they own .how many people are in their family .how many people are in their play group .they 'll be running around the house , they 'll probably take over before you need to give them much encouragement and they 'll be telling everybody.

using a telescope can be a lot of fun .and , if you get into amateur astronomy in any depth at all , you 'll probably wind up with a pretty big telescope , something eight to ten inches , maybe even larger .they 're getting more affordable , more sophisticated these days .there 's always a time that you 're going to take a trip to the beach , or you 're going to want to do maybe some bird spotting in the backyard , or you just do n't want to lug out the big guy , the big gun .and it 's nice to have a small , portable telescope we call a `` grab and go .

so , once you have a glaze that you are happy with.
prerecording is a very important and very cost saving or cost effective method when you go to record a project .now prerecording essentially means you 're going to record the entire album on your own .you 're probably using a four track or maybe recording into your computer via an inbox or something or on a keyboard .some keyboards like the triton allow you to put drum sounds and add any number of string or horn simulated sounds so that you can hear how this whole album is going to sound in a rough form before you get to the studio .maybe if you do this process and you find.

in this section , i 'm going to be showing you a basic women 's freestyle ski .there is a difference , so for girls , you want to go out and learn the tricks and learn all the free style moves and stuff .so if you 're a woman freestyle skier and you 're learning freestyle skiing tricks , you definitely want to pick a women 's freestyle ski .these skis are designed for women .there is a difference because the stiffness level , how they 're side cut going down it , the graphics are a lot more feminine.
in winterizing your car , coolant protection is the number one thing you want to be concerned about .protecting your car with antifreeze will raise the boiling point and it will also lower the freezing point in your cooling system .the freezing point is very important in your winter months .a fifty , fifty mix of a good quality antifreeze should bring your freezing point down to minus thirty four degrees .also , antifreeze protection will keep your engine block from rust or scaling as they call it , sending small particles into your radiator which will clog it up .rust can also damage your water pump causing it to leak over a period of time .antifreeze is one of your cheapest ways of protecting your cooling system .
o.k.
all right , in this clip we 're going to teach you how to do a backside boardslide .so , this one 's nice and easy ,as you come off the lip of the jump , you 're going to turn your body towards the bottom of the hill , towards the end of the rail .so , when you ollie , you 're going to turn , put your board right in between the bindings over the top of the box of the rail or whatever you 're hitting , keep your knees bent and look to where you want to go and follow it out all the way to the end .now , when you get to the end , you 're going to turn your shoulders and just ride off clean .so , make sure you keep your knees bent .and on this one you want to try -- maybe try it a little bit slower at first , so you can get the feel of the box or the rail or whatever you 're hitting.

hello , my name is jesse and.
and i 've fused some transfer paper onto some of my fabric.
the next type of trail we are going to be talking about is the bunny trail .this is generally where learners first start off , where lessons take place and where people who have just come out of lessons or do n't want to move on to a real trail yet go .you are not going to be using a chair lift most of them use something that looks like an escalator and think of it as a moving sidewalk.
the next game we 're going to talk about is the bunny hunt , and the bunny hunt works as follows .one player volunteers to be the bunny , and everyone else are the hunters .now you have two options where the bunny is concerned .you can have all of the hunters have unlimited paint and the bunny can have one hopper full of paint and a shield , and you can have a shield that 's made of a trash can lid or a small piece of plexiglass .just something roughly the diameter of a garbage can lid or option b.you can give the bunny as much paint as he can carry , as much paint as he wants to carry and limit each of the hunter to twenty rounds per hunter , and when the hunter is out of paint then he has to walk off the field .no sharing of ammunition among the hunters .so the game is very simple beyond that .once you 've decided upon the option the bunny will then be given a five minute head start to enter the field .the bunny will take his position up on the field and after five minutes the horn will go off to let the bunny know that the game has begun .then the hunters enter the field and then the objective of the game of course for the hunters is to kill the bunny .the objective of the bunny is simply to survive .
so let me explain scoliosis .there are two parts of scoliosis .all the other ones have a simple curve , either out or in , does n't matter it has a curve .scoliosis has an s and a c curve so your spine is doing some wacky stuff at this time .so regular c curve means that you are kind of pushed in , like one side is dominant and one side is lax .then you have an s curve which means everything here is fine and everything here is fine in a way.
here i 'll show you double right stroke on the third stroke .so we have eight strokes altogether alternating hands .right , left , right , left ,right , left , right , left .let 's just put this down first .okay ?now you have four right strokes .on the third let 's go ahead and add a double hitting the drum twice .once we feel comfortable we can go ahead and loop this .and then we can play it faster .
i 've won championships both as a coach and a player .let 's talk about the shooting motion .a really good shooter will tell you that establishing a shooting routine is crucial .what i mean by that is always making sure that your feet are set .always making sure that your feet are pointed towards the basket .having them be no wider than your shoulders .having your knees bent , ready to receive the basketball .when you receive the basketball , being ready to shoot the basketball .it does n't matter if somebody 's running at you , or if you 're wide open .your motion is the same every time , ever time , every time .receive the basketball.
so let 's just turn it on really quickly .with our vanilla beaten into our cream cheese and butter mixture , we 're going to add two and half cups of powdered sugar .so we just want to scoop this in here carefully so that we 're not spilling powdered sugar everywhere unless you 're going for the snowy look in your kitchen .now , with most icings and frosting , the measurements for the sugar are going to be not terribly exact .because powdered sugar is so very powdered , it can absorb a lot of moisture including from the air.
okay , let 's talk about a hot tip for dialog processing .now , as we remember we sent all of our dialog tracks to a single bus , right .we took all of our dialogs into the bus one , all of our effects into bus three , four , and music to five and six .let 's go down to that auxiliary bus , okay .i 'm going to be setting up what 's called the dialog chain .now this is one things that some mixers like to keep private or secretive , but this is one of the things i 've learned when i started working with sound mixes in an analog studio , working with film magnetics stock back and forth and.
to begin , we 're going to look at the different types of writing tools that you might use .you have a choice .easiest , cheapest and most readily available , i hope , are calligraphy markers , which work like so .they have a broad nib and a skinny side .however , as with all things that are cheap and easy to find , the calligraphy nibs eventually soften over time and you 're going to see that your hairlines get thicker and the edges of the nib get kind of squished down .so the alternative is to use a steel nibbed pen .and a steel nib pen is going to give you the beautiful broad lines , just make sure i do n't have too much ink , and also beautiful hairlines and a little more control than the marker .so my recommendation is if you at all can , and sometimes people ca n't manage the pen , i would suggest starting out with a steel nib pen which is the historic tool for writing , for beautiful writing .the nibs come in a variety of sizes .here i have a c0 , which is a big one , and a c1 , which is the next size down .you can see there 's a little bit of difference there .what you want to avoid are the nibs that are pointed because pointed nibs , this nib is not the correct nib to use , will not do the proper writing technique that we 're going to be working on .now here 's another one , a different brand of nib .this one comes from japan , it 's a tape nib .so to start i would say get a large nib and work with that , whether it 's marker or steel nib .
in order to take a chip shot , you want to try and kick the ball over the top of the goal keeper to dip into the goal , so we have to be aware of the goalkeeper 's positioning .when the goalkeeper is not in the goal on his or her goal line , that is a opportunity for use to take a chip shot .the technique behind taking a chip shot.
it 's a very position race .it 's run two laps around the track .first lap , you usually run between 50 seconds and to 55 seconds for the first lap .this is event more of a combo of speed and an aerobic endurance so most of your energy are geared towards your first lap of the 400 meters .the 800-meter is also a staggered position so meaning the 800-meter will start top of the turn into the first 100 meters .each runner stays in their lane after the first 100 meters , then they break through the other lane .
next i 'm going to show you the slow method of what the hands are doing but forget about the bass drum for now .the best thing to say is the first thing we 're going to do.
okay , prior to doing the actual chains , i just want to point out one more time .i hope i put the information out a little bit earlier .make sure you always check your owner ?s manual and get what the vehicle manufacturer requires for chains .there are some vehicles where they 're not recommended use on , other applications , four wheel drives , where they recommend you have them on all four wheels or not at all .it is a good idea , if you can have chains on your rear , that just gives you that much more breaking and cornering stability .it wo n't help you on acceleration too much on front wheel drive cars but the breaking is dramatically increased .so , that being said , this is standard type s chain and that 's a rating used for automobiles .that basically means it 's requirements , it needs about an inch and a half of over tread clearance and somewhere in the neighborhood of between a half and three quarters of an inch on sidewall clearance .what that means is how much extra space you have to have around the tire to give the chains adequate clearance.
in restorative yoga , there 's many benefits .not only , we could distress and center yourself more and be able to face your day.
we are going to show you again some basic composition ideas for creating chords or chord progression in the key of g flat major .so we are going to stay basically in the key of g flat.
okay , right now we 're going to talk about white balance .white balance is how you compensate to try to get pure white from different kinds of lighting situations .let 's say for example , that you 're outside in daylight .well , daylight , because it reflects off the sky , is more of a blue type light but if you go into lighting on an interior of a house that 's incandescent lighting , it 's got more of a yellow tone to it , so everything is toned yellow .it 's got , in cameras.
okay , so that we 've established a safe distance by putting your hands on the shoulders and after we 've established eye contact and let the other actor know what we 're going to do.
in this final clip on how to audition for a broadway play , i 'm going to talk about how to keep up your stamina .do n't quit , it 's a hard business , there 's a lot of rejection .it 's not just about how talented you are but luck .do you look the part , do they love you ,are you luck enough to fit in with the other cast members to have the look that the producer 's going for .there 's so many factors that are beyond your control .if you find yourself burning out , you know what ?take a break , take a month off , take a vacation find a side job a side passion .produce your own play , then come back to it do whatever you can to try not to quit .even if it means taking breaks to rejuvenate yourself .do n't go crazy and overboard on it , try and have realistic expectations .remind yourself that it 's beyond your control to a certain extent .if you 're doing everything that i said , if you 're going to your lessons , you 're doing this.
hi , we 're cartooning today .we 're drawing all sorts of animals and now we 're going to keep the story going by adding some things to show what kind of story you are trying to tell with the kind of characters and pictures you are drawing .now this dog all ready looks pretty excited .but how can we tell even more ?well , by drawing a word balloon or a word bubble .just basically a circle with a little thing pointing to his mouth to show where it ?s coming from .this guy could be saying , i want that bone .and that dog is pretty hungry .so , what are we going to do with that dog ?well , i 'm going to make him running towards the bone , and we 're going to draw it right here .oh , that is a scrumptious bone !and he 's running , he 's running.
the g natural minor scale is extracted from the b flat major scale .therefore it has f sharp turning to f natural , e going to e flat , and b going b flat , so we have g , a , b flat , c , d , e flat , f , and g.
willie : hi !my name 's willie .i 'm from carson 's saw shop , here in eugene , oregon , and.
hi , today i 'm going to show you how to play a piece by vivaldi.
the gouge , the spindle gouge can also be used to make beads on a tool , on your work .one of the things you do to start this off is to take your skew , make two v-cuts at each side .you want to get a little bit of relief in .you then take your spindle gouge , starting at the top in the center , bring it down , raise your handle and twist .if you do n't start with your v-cut on your relief you are not going to be able to rotate to the sides .again bring it around until your top edge of the skew is almost perpendicular .you want to try to do a smooth rotating motion to prevent any type of dimple within the work .you can also typically finish it off on the opposite side by rotating it in to the center .
right now , we 're talking to the soloist , the guitarist .he 's not the lead singer , he 's the guitarist .he has a personality and not all the time -- most of the times , people do n't see it .he 's traveled a long way , he 's toured and everything.
observe what their style is .does the teacher inspire child ?does she help them become for confident ?is she encouraging to them even if she knows in her heart that a large percentage of them will not dance as a career , but she can still teach them confidence , elegance , flexibility , discipline , and self-esteem .dance should be a type of stress reliever for a child , as opposed to a new source of tension or frustration .make sure that the teacher is in control of the class and that she 's encouraging to be expressive in their movements , but that 's she 's not condescending in her approach .is she patient ?is he or she a good role model for the children in the classroom and outside of the classroom ?is she knowledgeable in the type of dance that she 's teaching ?the class time should not be chaotic .the teacher should clearly be in charge without having to raise his or her voice .
do you really want to pluck your eyelashes ?this is c.g with lips and more .how do you pluck your eyelashes , if you really want to do that .i do n't recommend it because it 's very painful .but if you have an eyelash that say is real unruly , you could consider using a tweezers .as always make sure your hands are clean before you 're working around your eyes or anybody else 's , but i would n't do this on somebody else .but if you do and it 's really crooked .say you have one right in the middle of the eye.
you snug the feet in , nice and tight and hold onto the ankles , or the tips of the toes , like what he 's doing and use your elbows to try to press the knees outward and downward , just like that .and his goal is to try to breathe slowly and deeply and through the nose and out through the mouth and that 's sort of a relaxation technique to get the body to sort of loosen up , a little bit .another variation of this , would be for him to slide back and put his lower back against the wall .some people like.
ok.now we are actually going to play a note together .when playing the saxophone , you are putting together what i demonstrated in breath control and embouchure at the same time .basically you want a nice tight embouchure .the sides of your mouth have to be tight , keep your cheeks down .do not puff your cheeks and fill the saxophone with air without honking it too hard .it is real easy to do that , especially when you are beginning .the saxophone is louder than it may appear .so just go light on it .and here 's me demonstrating a note up close .if you notice , the corners of my mouth are really tight .my posture , i try to keep it as good as possible and no cheeks puffing .everything sounds good because of that .my embouchure is the most important thing .keep that in mind when you 're playing and let 's practice with your notes .
alright , so here  s some good news for you about where to learn more about a svengali deck .a lot of the dealers that will see this will also sell a dvd or a booklet on how to use it , and there 's even some websites .this came with some cards in it that had a website you could go to and learn more about it .if you buy a dvd on this , a lot of times it will even come with a deck .i want to encourage you to read , learn some more ideas , practice with a bunch of different ideas of your own .get used to how the deck works , but do n't be afraid to learn more , combine some ideas , read some books .this one actually came with a booklet of 101 tricks that you could do with it .that just came from a magic shop and they packaged it up standard just like that .there 's all kinds of places to find more info about where you can learn more tricks with the svengali deck .
now from here you want to bring it all in because we 're not ready to go out with that shape yet just by the natural forces of this wheel and the universe.
what we are going to demonstrate and talk about now is the proper method to secure a tarpaulin or some other type of covering or to secure a rope between two objects called the trucker 's hitch .the trucker 's hitch is basically coming off a substantial object with a piece of rope .the rope would then go around whatever anchor point.
sitting around and watching television , calling and chatting with friends , all of these things are n't necessarily working towards getting the job done .so , you want to make sure that you regiment yourself with certain disciplines as you 're going through your day-to-day work life .for example , you want to make sure that you 're up at a certain time everyday .you want to make sure that you get showered , get dressed as if you were actually going to a real office .all of these things might seem bizarre at the beginning but they really add up when it comes to sitting down in front of your desk and getting work done .also , you want to make sure that televisions , radios , pdas , anything where you could be -- instant messaging online , distracting websites , can all keep you from actually getting your work done .so , sometimes , working for a certain period of time and then stopping and taking a break can be a good way to reward yourself for completing the task at hand .
so i 'm going to add another glaze to it this time and this time.
and what you do is you take a nice inhale and exhale , drop one knee to the mat , bring it down as much as you possibly can , feeling the stretch all along that side .its okay.
of course , the opposite exercise is also important .i just reversed the weight .so this one weighs less , this one weighs more now .i 'll turn in the other direction , come back , and , again , i 'm going to be leading with my left foot that 's away from the unit .so like this and then with the swing , coming back , forward , swing .with my left arm here that i 'm pulling , upper back .with this , i 'm working my chest primarily and my anterior deltoid , coming across like this .primarily the chest though , with the side , and again working on my balance .
something to remember when you are using warm and cool colors , when you 're mixing them on your color palette , when you mix them together , the warm and cool colors , if you mix cool colors with cool colors and warm colors with warm colors , it 's hard to go around.
so flowers are another high value crop that we do n't want to ignore in the permaculture garden .flowers not only give beauty , and beautiful odor , they not only attract beneficial insects and bugs , but they also tend to delineate and define the garden .so in other words , we 're going to use these , a gladiola bulbs , the flowers that you often see in funerals and wedding and such , long , spikey , elegant flowers .we 're going to tuck these in the ground , and get rapid results , because we have these very robust little bulbs .in order to grow them quickly , we want to fill a generous supply of well rotted manure in each hole .and then tuck them in , preferably root side down , although they will find their way up , like so .you can see some of the color variation here , that 'll give us lots of interesting permutations .and from there , we merely want to cover them over , with this beautiful rich soil , tuck them in , mulch them in , and then try not to plant over them .remember that we 've planted our bulbs here , and not to double plant .these bulbs should be showing , within two weeks we should see them , and within a month they should be shooting up .that 's just one of many , many perennial flower bulbs that we can incorporate into the perennial garden .
these doggies were actually made by children 7 years and 11 years old .it 's a great project ; it can be made completely by hand .it has only 3 simple pieces in the pattern and it 's made with this nice fleecy fabric that you a lot in fabric stores and.
today i 'll show you how to make a no-slipping slipcover for any couch or chair .this is a great design , because there 's no constant tucking and fixing of the cover .i 'll show you how to make a fitted cover for the base of the couch .it 's completely fitted on the arms , and throughout the base of the couch .and then i 'll show you how to make cushion covers , and the cushions hold the base cover in place , and there 's no slipping .this cover was made using a regular home sewing machine , and it looks like it was reupholstered .these are the materials we 'll be using for our no-slip slipcover for our couch today .you 'll want to have plenty of pins .we 're going to be using some cording for piping .now if you 're not if you 're not interested in doing the piping , you wo n't need the cording .and there are several different kinds of cording that you can use , and i 'll tell you about that when we do the piping .you may want to use zippers to close the cushions , or you can also use velcro , so you 'll have to decide if you want to use zippers or velcro .you 'll need a seam ripper in case there 's any mistakes .you 'll need a zipper foot if you 're going to be doing piping .if you 're not using the piping you wo n't need the zipper foot .you 'll need a regular either a regular foot , or if your machine has a special foot for dealing with heavier fabrics , you 'll want to make sure you use that .you 'll want to use needles that are for heavy fabric , so check with the instructions on your machine , and see what 's appropriate for that .i 'm using a jeans/denim needle for my machine .you 'll want to have plenty of bobbins loaded , because we 'll be using a lot of thread , and you do n't want to have to stop in between to reload bobbins .you 'll need a tape measure , some good scissors for cutting heavy fabric , plenty of thread for your whole project , and a nice heavy material for the couch cover .you do n't want to use anything light , like cottons or dress fabrics , because the couch , it just gets too much wear and it wo n't last .so , you can use canvases , you can use even outdoor fabrics , or there 's a huge array of upholstery fabric that you can find .okay , i think that 's it.
when we 've talked about communication , it 's always been from the standpoint of making sure that your team can , can communicate effectively on the field .and we 've talked about verbal codes and there 's a lot of cases where verbal codes are exactly the wrong thing to do .in many cases , especially if you 're stalking an opponent 's position , you may be getting closer and closer to him.
they also usually have about a 600 denier or less outer layering .so the layering on the outside is about 600 or less , the lining can vary depending on the light weight blanket and the insulation is going to be about 8 ounces or 220 grams or less .that would be considered a lightweight blanket .lightweight blankets are good for mild climates for warm barns or if you do n't care has a little bit of a hair coat , not a long one.
chinese writing is very different from most other languages in the world .in the chinese writing system , chinese symbols represent each character which corresponds to a single spoken syllable .a majority of words in all modern varieties of chinese require two or more characters to write .many chinese characters were adopted according to their meaning by the japanese and korean languages to represent native words , disregarding pronunciation altogether .chinese characters are also considered to be the world 's longest continuously used writing system .
within our brushes we can change the hardness of our brush actually making our brush a bit softer or a bit harder depending on how we want to paint with it .so if we look at our screen here we can see that i already have a brush selected.
when you 're ready to go outside and use our telescope , there are couple of things you should have in order to make your night viewing a better experience .one , is to find a light that is a red light .now , why would you want to use a red light ?well , you 'd want to use a red light because white light destroys your night vision .it takes about five minutes for your night vision to build up .now , this particular light has both the white , if you flip it one way , and the red .so , it 's very handy .so , when you 're at night and you 're out by your telescope , use the red light .you can simply get a flashlight and use red fingernail polish and point over the lens and that works fine as well .the other thing that you should take with you , and this is really a key thing for astronomy , a good binocular .these are 750 's , they 're inexpensive binoculars , good way to get started .you have the ability to see all kinds of incredible things with binoculars .when you use binoculars make sure that you tuck your arms underneath to steady them and then move back .you may want to lean against a tree .but , by taking even the small binocular that we have here and scanning the night sky in the summer , up through the milky way , you 'll see some incredibly galaxies and nebulae and just star clusters that 'll blow your mind .
kneeling with ball support .this is a position that is simple.
hi !my name is lynn loughmiller.
first thing we have to do is wash the potatoes .throw them in a pot of boiling water .to check if they are down.
well my first job as a music producer started when i was about 18 years old .now i did n't get paid for it , but i was making beats in the back of a couple of independent documentaries , and independent internet tv shows .so i started making beats , you know putting them in there , then from there when i moved to miami , i started making beats for artists .my first job where i actually got paid was for a wonderful female singer .i had met her actually on myspace , and i played her some of the tracks , they really liked it , and her and her management came in .they paid us , you know a decent sum for three tracks , and they went on her album and it was a really great thing .we had budget , so therefore we were able to bring in.
i 'm going to show you how to do a roll down the spine from the plough position in modern dance .this is a nice way to release all of the muscles in your back , and to open up your spine .our spine have several vertebra that are stacked on top of each other , and in life we tend to squish those vertebra together .this is a way to open up your spine so that you have a little cushion space in between each vertebra .so i want you to think about that while we 're rolling down the spine .first we 're going to go into your plough position .i 'm going to reach my hands over my head , and i 'm going to reach my feet for my hands .just get into a position that 's comfortable for you .if your feet do n't reach the ground , that 's okay .you can still roll down the spine .it 's important that when we 're in the plough position , we stay there for a couple minutes before we roll down the spine .i 'm not going to stay there for the sake of time , but you should .so once i 've stayed there for a little bit , i 'm going to roll down the spine , and i 'm going to think of reaching each vertebra ,starting from my neck , one at a time , each vertebra is going to reach for the ground , until the very last , my tail bone , reaches the ground .i 'm going to do it as slow as possible.
now i 'm going to show you the different types of sugars that are present in different kinds of foods.
our next point is a really good point for just general pain .it 's called kunlun mountains or the aspirin point or bladder 60.and it actually is in this space between the achilles tendon and the bone .the particular spot is about two-thirds of the way up , but the easiest thing to do with this area is just to massage up and down in that space between the bone and the tendon .and this will soothe pain just about anywhere in the body .it 's a generalized , as it 's called the aspirin point .so it keeps the energy following , eases the pain , and can be used for any kind of painful condition .it can be used also just as a calming mechanism .it 's a nice point to use if your dog has been traumatized .you just rub in this point and it 's soothing and calming and takes away any pain .and again , it 's an up and down motion in that space between the ankle bone and where this muscle begins up above it .
hi , i 'm joel jones .i own jonesy 's , inc.
i just ca n't get it .what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to lean on my side over here.
sock knitting can appear a little intimidating at the beginning because there are a few steps around the hell area that are a little complicated .but i 've broken up the parts of the sock in this little test sock into different colors to give you an idea of what 's involved .at the top here in purple is a ribbing .you always want to do a ribbing because that will hold your sock up .then you are going to do the leg .you 're going to switch to the leg .and you 'll make that as long or as short as you want .there are people that make socks that are just little like tennis socks , or you can have knee socks .after the sock you are going to go into the heel flap , back here in blue .and there are different ways to knit it to reinforce it so that it 's more durable .after the heel flap you are going to go into turning the heel , which is this green .and there 's your little heel .then you have to work out the gusset to get back to the stitches required for the measurement of your foot .and that 's this white section here .that 's decreasing to get to the size of your foot .then you 're going to want to work the length of your foot .obviously this is a test sock .no ones feet are like this .and in the end you are going to be working the blue portion which is shaping your toe .
a very regular and average , even sort of form , and this would be writing which is orderly and disciplined and efficient , in not only writing , but this is a person who has all those qualities within them .this is the regular type of form , and you can see that it has certain angular and roundedness within it , but it 's not very pronounced one way or the other .that 's why it 's regular .ok ?and now if we come to the rounded type of form , now rounded , that means somebody with a very round , i 'm going to try and attempt to do it for you , now you can see that it 's very rounded .this is a person who can be somewhat conformist perhaps , a little naive .as you can see , this is the rounded form .these people tend to write a little slower also , because they are just putting a lot of effort into it .ok.and now we have what is referred to as angular writing , and that person tends to be analytical , mental , and they have self-will , determination , that 's angular .as you can see , along with that angular , you 've got writing which is a little faster.
alright , so we can add a little bit more flavor to the chords that we 're playing .the first thing that i do is instead of playing a g chord , i 'll play a g7 chord .so that 's looking like this : open , open , second fret , first fret .so , c , almost there , back to g7 , and then the break , c , c7 .ok ?go to f.
these are the two cymbals that put together your high hat .one is heavier than the other that 's the one you want on the bottom .so that will rest on that little ped that we talked about the other one.
okay the next combination we 're going to discuss.
she is suntanned , she is in here .i can just come in .i do n't have to put the color everywhere .but maybe she 's from brazil , but she is very , very tan .brazil or rio de janero .barcelona .then just need to indicate with the color in there .also you only need to use a few colors .i am going to come in with the purple and just bring this jacket to life .i 'm going to just come in here , do this .pow , pow , pow .i do n't have to color everything.
ok.so , now we 're still doing our moderate walking .and , with that we 're doing cardio bursts .so , this cardio burst is skipping .skipping is so simple , so easy , so fun to do .just like when you were a kid , it 's the basic principal of skipping .so , remember to have fun and remember to breathe .i 'll demonstrate to you how you add in skipping with your walk .and , that 's the way you skip.
in warrior training , what it does is it develops your resilience spirit .warrior training is not just about the combative martial arts .a real warrior is somebody whose very resilient , who does n't give up .there was an old japanese adage that say , 'if you get knocked down seven times , give up the eighth time '' .that 's what the warrior training is about .it 's similar to yoga and that we use this physical principles , be it kickboxing or jiu jitsu to reach a higher plane .historically , the martial arts was about the spirit and conditioning the spirit through physical body , similar to hatha yoga .so a lot of times in warrior training , we often go back to the meditation , to the physicality and all the different components that comprise warrior training .
alright , this next exercise is called eight up four back .it 's about stop and go , and acceleration .i 'm going to demonstrate it to you right now .you 'll sprint up eight steps and make a hard stop , and then straight into a back peddle for four steps , and then accelerate back up eight more , stop , four more , sprint back out , eight again , and that 's the exercise .okay .you ready ?ready .start back out .up eight , back four .perfect .let 's do it again , one more time .good hard stops , perfect .okay , the benefits of doing that drill is helping you go backwards , helping you go forwards .sometimes you 'll have a quick guard who likes to give it to you like that .you can get it and get it back .
one thing , that i 'd pay attention to , is whether you see a lot of beginner students but hardly any advanced students there .that is a bad sign .that means the retention is not good .for whatever reason , the kids are just not sticking around .they may be quitting because they 're getting hurt and the classes are boring .there could be a multitude of reasons .ideally , they should be constantly learning and having fun .although , they must see progress , they still need to have fun .however , if it is all fun , chances are , they ?re not learning anything .they will not like that , either .on the other hand , if it is no fun and all learning , it will be similar to boot camp .who would want that ?
as we go on to pose number five , once again i want you to point your right toe , pull it into your left foot , which creates the basic , which is our first pose again .but this time , i 'm going to bring my right hand on top of my left bicep , my left hand on top of my right bicep .notice how my fingers in pose number five are upward and relaxed it ?s so important in pose number five that you do not fist up your hands because this is part of the man 's pose and i 'll show that to you another time .it 's also important that you do n't let your fingers be relaxed and lazy .this is a pose that really makes you seem like you have got some business going on .a little bit of attitude.
madd is actually a grassroots national organization .we 're based out of irving , texas .we have chapters in each of the states , throughout the united states .madd actually stands for mothers against drunk driving , and we are working in all kinds of communities .we offer school programs ; from kindergarten through college .we work with law enforcement , by providing them with equipment that they can use .we also support them at checkpoints .we have the most comprehensive victims service organization in the united states .we go in and help families , from what we call `` the moment of impact .
okay , guys , so on this little tutorial here we 're going to be talking about duplicating a layer .now , we 're going to duplicate the layer because we 're going to want another exact replica of this text that we have here to actually make our reflection .and there 's two way to do it .you can go up to your layers palette , and hit duplicate layer , or if you want the easy way , which i like to do , is shortcuts all the time , you can hit command j or control j on the pc .so as you can see down over here , right when we did that it added two reflections layers , and one of them is a copy layer .what we want to do is we actually want to click and drag this copy layer.
but if you do not have the right supplies , this will not be a successful experience for you .and i want to show you some of the supplies that you do no need to have .first of all , you need to keep a pair -- a pack of matches with you and this is a great little portable shovel that you should always keep with you and -- if you 're going to build a fire .another important tool is this axe .you ca n't make kindling out of wood if you do n't have an axe and kinda shave down some of this wood which brings me to another thing .you want to have a log or definitely plenty of wood .we 're going to talk about how much wood you should have in order to keep a campfire going .also , again , another source of kindling is newspaper .just dry newspaper .you need a water container to be able to get the fire out in the end.
but most of the other vegetables are pretty easily planted .when you get your containers even ones that you have grown from seeds yourself or ones that you have purchased in the garden center.
and i 'm here to answer the question.
just as you can get a lot of bang for your buck if you can manage to match colors to its similar value , you also can work with juxtaposing colors of similar saturation , and contrasting colors of similar saturation .so what happens in this color study , is that right around the center here , we want our focus .we 've got the most saturation.
what i use is a actually a cloth diaper .this , i 've found really works the best .the important thing is to use a cloth , if you 're using cloth , that is lint free .you can , if you use the wrong kind of cloth , you can really scratch your record and you do n't want to touch it .it 's important.
now , this particular stand has two cymbal stands in one , and this is to alleviate the problem of having two stands ' bottoms running into each other .so it 's just kind of save you some room .so we 're going to set up the ride cymbal portion of this stand right now .so you have to loosen these two guys and spread the legs .it 's nice to get the thigh in there and try to help do some stuff .use all your body parts .and then we just want to make sure this is to the bottom but not touching the ground , and you tighten that and tighten this one .so now , we have -- our base is set .and then i usually slide this underneath the kick drum .now , this is the same thing as the other cymbal stand .we want this leg facing in towards the drum kit .because when we 're hitting the cymbals , we do n't want this to tip over .so that 's in there , nice and sturdy .so let 's go ahead and set up the actual ride cymbal portion .i had to loosen some stuff here .and this is just completely eyeballing it and just getting it close for now .let 's go ahead and loosen the head and get the head to where we think it looks good .and then this stand is unique because it actually pops out of itself and then you put in there .let 's tighten .and i 'm going to adjust this head a little bit .and there is our ride cymbal stand .it 's set up and ready to go .
so also , like other rooms , another thing that i can go ahead and pack that i wo n't be needing in the next two weeks are decorations , which is kind of , could be considered the same thing as knickknacks .in the bedroom , in particular , this means any decorative bedding , so these two big pillows , i might can go ahead and pack .a good way to pack these , again , is in a bigger box because they 're going to be light , and that will also protect them .if i wanted to , since these are silk , i might go ahead and put a plastic bag around each pillow as well , or put them both in one plastic bag if they 'll fit , and then put them in the box just so things wo n't tear anything .if i had any decorative pillows on my bed then i could throw those in there as well , i wo n't be needing those .so any kind of bedding that you can go ahead and pack , you wo n't be having to do that when packing day actually comes around .in addition , any kind of wall decorations , again , making a decision based on how big they are , what they 're made out of , if they roll up , if they have glass , making decisions based on those things about what you 're going to keep on the wall until the last minute or what you 're going to go ahead and pack .i might go ahead and pack this butterfly because it 's just a canvas that i can roll up , i can put it in a poster roll , a cardboard poster roll , and that can be ready to go .the other things on my bedroom wall have glass.

from this point , so that the edge is folded to follow the outside edge over here and allow this point to come down in the front .i 'm turning the unit over to the front and you can see that the face kind of comes down like that .allow it to come down , flatten and crease .and , then for this point we are going to fold it up inside that flap .because , our cats do n't have such a sharp nose .so , fold it up inside that flap and there you have the face of your cat .now , in the back you have this flap .one of the ears is already in place .take the other flap and fold it to the other side , so that the edge follows along this edge right here .and , you have the ears of your cat .crease that .now , you have the head and the face of your cat already .this will become the tail .what we are going to do , is inside reverse fold this section .and depending on how fat or how skinny or what shape.
first thing you need to know is your access code , how to leave the country .for example the united states to call abroad , you need to know 011 , that 's your access code out .you then need to get a country code .in the front of the phonebook , in fact are a list of all the country codes .the uk i happen to know is forty-four , france is thirty-three , china is eighty-six .i happen to call those countries.

now i 'll be discussing zils .now , earlier we used the word zils to describe the two metal parts on a tambourine that vibrate against each other , so here , just a set of zils would be on a tambourine .now , zils more generally would refer to what you would know as finger cymbals .now , these are from india , but you 'll see them in in different countries in the middle east .now the idea between these two instruments is to vibrate against each other .you 'll see this in tibet even , in religious ceremonies , where you 'll hit two cymbals , and the slight difference in tone between the two cymbals creates oscillation , basically meaning it 's slightly out of tune from one another to create a vibration sound .now , they can also be used for dancers , so like belly dancers , for example , would use these instruments , but they would keep them on one hand ; they might even have a pair of them like you saw in castanets , where they have one hand and the other hand creating different rhythms as they dance .

first we 're going to take our kettle off the main heat , then we 're going to take our malt extract which has been soaking in hot water , start mixing it in very nice and slowly , and trying to make sure that it all gets blended in .now a tip that you may not get from a lot of other brew starters is that you do n't actually want to add all the malt extract right now .instead , we 're going to add roughly half to two-thirds of the extract .what this will prevent is some of the caramel-y flavors which are associated with extract brewing .the rest of the extract we 're going to add with about fifteen to twenty minutes left .during this process , you want to continually stir to make sure everything is all mixed together , and that none of it is going to be left on the bottom in order to scorch .now that you 've got two-thirds or half of the extract put in , just continually stir it , turn on your heat , and start working on getting up to a boil .in particular , if you 're going to be using dry malt extracts , you never want to add that while it 's boiling , you want to add that before hand or else.

now , i want to talk for just a second about the selection of your leaves .because , it is important what kind of leaves you choose .what 's important about the leaf is first of all that it be a nice soft supple leaf so that it will roll into the clay very easily without cracking .the second very important thing is that the back of the leaf have pronounced veins .a lot of leaves you 'll look at the front side , they 're pretty you like the shape .but , if you flip it over the back is almost flat and you 're not going to get any detail transferred onto your clay .this small oval leaf is an example of a leaf that wo n't work well .it 's hard .it 's a hard leaf and it 's also it does n't have very much on the back there .and , i 'm going to roll it in just to show that there 's not a whole lot of detail coming out of that leaf .so , later on in the project when we try to glaze that area you 're not going to see much at all .but , then this leaf which is a mint leaf it has a lot of pronounced veins on the back of it .and , if i roll that in there you can see all the veins going all the way to the edge of the leaf and the center vein is very pronounced .and , that 's what you want to look for is some leaf that 's very soft with pronounced veins .maple leaves are excellent if you 're looking for big leaves .fig leaves are also excellent .there 's other , there 's plenty of different leaves that work really well .but , those are two that i really like myself .
the wood chop is a just functional exercise , and like the name says , it 's just like chopping wood .i know that most of us have never done it , even though if you have , more power to you .and you want to think about the move because we are all familiar with it though .when you get into this stance , your feet are shoulder width apart , toes slightly out , and you want to keep your knees from locking them.
i 'm going to show you how to add a nice little cursor to your page .how 's it going ?i 'm jason ketchmark from myspace 4 musicians .i 'm going to show you how to change the standard cursor that we all know to something that looks a little bit nicer .finding a myspace cursor for your page is as simple as going to google and searching myspace cursors .as you can see , we 've typed it in .let 's do a google search , and pick one of these pages .now , this page , for instance , usually , they divide them up into categories , so let 's pick the category .we 'll pick an arrow cursor and not go too crazy .and basically , it has the boxes for the code , so we 're going to copy that .hold on , i got to redo that .because i got to use safari , so it pops up the thing .finding a cursor for your page is very simple .there 's a lot of websites out there that already have a wide variety of cursors that you could select from that are free .ca n't go wrong with that .so we 're going to type in myspace cursors , and you can see ,we 've got a lot of results , so let 's just go ahead and pick one .all right .now , most of these websites will divide the cursors up into categories if they have a lot , so just pick a category that you like .and we 're going to pick cartoon cursors in this case .and now , it has all the different ones .and now , with this site , when you mouse over it , it actually shows you the cursor .other websites , you know , they might have it a little bit different .maybe you 'll see the cursor on the left or right or something .but all of them are going to have a box with code in it , so you want to select the code .most of them will automatically select when you click in it .and if not , you could just go and click in the box -- right-click , select all .okay .the code 's selected .now , we 're going to right-click and hit copy .and go back to our myspace page to add the cursor .now , we 're in edit profile mode right here , so from the homepage , just click edit profile .and any one of these boxes ...usually , you want to do it in the about box because that 's going to be the easiest and less cluttered .hit paste -- right-click , paste .puts the code in .you save the changes .now , something to keep in mind is that not all browsers will actually put the new cursor into effect .so usually internet explorer will be the most common one , but just keep that in mind in case it 's not working on a couple of your friends ' browsers .that is how you add a custom cursor to your myspace page .i 'm jason ketchmark from the myspace 4 musicians .have a fun time clicking .
these are some of the thinnest frames that you are probably going to find on any frame shop wall .they should not really be used for anything over a 16x20 .do to the fact when you put them together back here.
alright , now i 'm going to talk about a series of , a series of words that are good for articulation , but they are also just really good general vocal warm-ups .we 've talked about how we 've had all these consonants.
the next thing we 're going to cover is the tunnel .the tunnel comes in different sizes anywhere from eight to twenty feet .the best way to start the tunnel is to take it down to its shortest length and have the owner at the other end with some treats to encourage the dog to go through .so you would have someone holding him an one end and the owner would coax him through at the other end .argo , come .good boy !lots of praise .keep it nice .this can be a scary obstacle for them .switch them .you can go progressively longer and longer but your end result , you need to have it at it full length .this is not a full length tunnel .this is only an 8 inch or 8 foot tunnel .and how you would get him to go through after training them.
in this clip we are going to talk about maintenance for these birds .so , basic maintenance obviously , is food and water .the other maintenance is , these guys get a little bit bored , so you may want to switch out their toys .they should have a decent amount of destructible toys in their cage that they can destroy and like sift through , so any sort of destructible toy needs to be replaced once it becomes destroyed .and these guys also , to maintain their feather quality , they either needed to be misted on a daily basis or by a daily basis , if you can , with a small mister .you can also offer these birds , a lot of them love to take baths , you can offer them a very swallow bowl of water .put it on the bottom of the cage and these birds will like jump in and take a little bath and fluff the water up over their feathers and let it run down their back .the water helps remove any soot and stuff that might be in your household that is accumulating and any sort of dusts .basically , keep their feathers clean .also , compare to their environment , our homes with air conditioning and heat , tend to be extra dry , so lots of time they will have trouble molting their feathers properly and it can end up with some damaged feathers if they do n't have a high enough humidity .again , if you mist them a couple of times a day , this help compensate for the low humidity in your home and keeping a good feather health for these guys .basic other stuff that these guys need , is surely recommended that once year you take them to a vet .where a vet can hold them still and look underneath their feathers , and check underneath their wings .open up their mouths and look into their eyes , to make sure that there is n't beginnings of any serious health problems , which , is difficult for the average owner to do .sometimes these guys need to have their nails trimmed as their nails will get overgrown .if you take your bird out of the cage or considering taking it outside , you need to decide whether to clip these guys wings .it can be fun to have a bird that can fly all over your house and come and goes as it please , but it can also be very dangerous for the bird .so , you may have to clip your birds wings every 12 weeks to every 6 months depending on where and how often your bird is molting .the other basic thing is cage maintenance , so that there is not any loose strings .check your cage so that there is not anything that may wrap around their toes or legs and cut of circulation .you need to clean out their cage.
cinnamon or nutmeg right there ; you do n't need much a little goes a long way , some grated cheese ( 1/2 cup ) , and then our ricotta nice and creamy that looks really nice .we are going to fold that together to incorporate the egg.
we 're now going to talk about choosing tiles for your tile mosaic project .there are two basic types of tiles to choose from , low fire tiles and high fire tiles .the low fire versus the high fire basically refers to the temperature at which the tiles are baked at in the kiln .low fire tiles are much easier to break and to shape , and tend to come in much brighter colors .they 're also a little bit cheaper , but because they were baked at a lower temperature , they 're more porous , so they 're only very good for indoor use .high fire tiles can be used for indoor or outdoor use .they 're a little sturdier , a little heartier , and wo n't absorb moisture .tiles come in all shapes and sizes , from very , very small , to very big and colorful .you can also get tiles in solid colors , you can get them with bright and beautiful designs , and you can even get shapes .so look at your local hardware store , your tile store , or even the junkyard for all sorts of different tiles for your mosaic project .
today i am going to teach you how to change a fluorescent light bulb .most fluorescent light bulbs are located in the kitchen area or in the garage and what you can do you can locate the one that is giving you trouble .either it is flickering on and off or it is off all together .now what you want to do is you want to go over to that light fixture and if it 's an exposed bulb.
earlier we learned the c minor scale and now we are going to learn the c minor arpeggio .we 're just going to learn the c minor arpeggio in the first position and just play in one octave .this is the c minor arpeggio .and going down .and as you will be able to hear the c minor arpeggio sounds a little bit darker , it 's because instead of playing and e what you are playing in the minor arpeggio is actually an e flat.
we have taken our potatoes out , we let them boil.
in the intermediate section of striking , a yokomen uchi is a side strike which is a lot like a shomen strike where it comes up and down , only now , it 's a circular strike to the side of the head .targeting , one of my favorite points is right here on the side of the neck .imagine he 's frankenstein , and has bolts coming out of the side of his neck .that 's exactly where i want to hit him .along good place is right along the , right below the ear , right along the jawline .if you hit someone really hard on this side , it 'll actually break the jaw on this side .and if that 's a viable thing that you can do , in a self-defense situation , and you think well that 's very not aikido-like ,well , breaking his jaw versus having to kill him , that 's harmonious to me .if he 's really trying to attack me and the only thing i can do to stop him is to break his jaw to stop him.
i 'm going to demonstrate how to do triplets .i 'm going to use the entire drum kit , but my main focus is going to be between my right foot and my two hands .a triplet as it implies is 3 hits .it 's also used a lot in heavy metal music which i play heavy metal , so how appropriate that it happens to be one of my favorite things to do .this is for matt by the way .okay matt , ready buddy ?here we go .that was a triplet with some other fancy stuff at the end .
the last zone that is still used in play is called the phased-out zone .the phased-out zone is a special place in the game where you put creatures or other permanents that have the ability phasing .anything that has phasing that is in play currently is put into the poz at the beginning of your turn .in fact , before you untap , that 's the only thing that can happen before your untapped step .once things are out of play in the phased out zone , anything that has phasing in the zone is put back into play .what this does is it means everything with phasing is in play only every other turn .so , half of the time it is in play , half of the time it 's out of play , alternating every turn .things that phase in have haste if they 're creatures .that means that things that have phased out and back in can still attack .
the last stretch we did was shoulder rolls .the next stretches we 're going to do are crisscross .so when you 're crisscrossing your arms you want to bring your , starting from the back or starting from forward , it really does n't matter .when you bring your arms back you really want to feel that stretch in your pectorals and your shoulder when you bring it back .and when you crisscross your arms forward , you really want to feel the stretch back in your , the back of your deltoids , in the back of your shoulders .so as you bring it back , you 're going to feel a stretch in your front , forward feel the stretch towards the back .now when you 're crisscrossing arms.
when it starts to boil for a little bit then i 'm going to drop the temperature down to low.
so i had the bedroom suite that they used when they were married , i have a chair that was in my parent  s bedroom for years , and i wanted to put pictures of my family up here .this is a picture frame that was as i said , a twelve dollar mirror was in this and it came apart , the mirror broke or something.
it basically started by being able to launch clay targets .i 'll give you some examples of clay targets , which were thrown in the air at various and different angles , and it was called shooting around the clock .and there was a point in the center where a trap was located , and it launched targets in different directions , simulating what you would experience in the field .it turned out to be a very successful game .there was a contest in outdoors magazines , and the person from montana who named the game skeet , which is a scandinavian word meaning `` to shoot .
i 'm going to go ahead and demonstrate a goal kick .usually your goal will be about right here .you 'll have your lines right here for the smaller part of the goal.
this split finger is a pitch that is gripped with the first finger and second fingers severely outside the ball with the thumb under the ball .the split finger causes the ball to rotate very slowly or basically not at all and causes the ball to drop severely when it reaches the batter and that 's a split finger .
today i 'm going to teach you how to install a new cabinet door .now , the first thing you need to do is find the opening for the cabinet door , and you need to measure it .you 'll have to measure it height wise , and width wise to get the proper fitting door for that application .then you 'll want to go down to any hardware store that carries cabinets or cabinet doors , and you 'll want to find a cabinet door that you like , or one that matches the others , that are already there .once you find the matching cabinet door , and you find it to the correct dimensions , then you want to bring it back.
so start a motion with arms open , legs bent and whenever the arms go back.
this can cause a lot of damage when your hair is growing out because it causes a lot of tangling and when you want to remove them , it causes a lot of breakage because it becomes very matted by the roots .now , the way i do it is i create very nice precise rows across the back of the head all the way up into the front .as you can see they 're very defined , when you go home.
and i 'm a fitness trainer and running coach .today i want to talk with you about how to start a running program if you are a beginning runner .one of the first things you want to do is make sure you have a really good pair of running shoes.
, we are going to need a foundation to match the skin , we are going to need our stipple sponge , our cosmetic sponge our eye shadows that we were using in a previous series .what we are doing , once again i 'll reiterate that we are not using any of the cream base were going to do some , use some tools that you can use from home out of your own make up kit .such as like your own eye shadow and you can shave off the eye shadow and get a basic moisturizer.
i 'm an illustrator with larser arts and.
we 're doing some potting of mexican honeysuckle .it 's native to texas easy to grow from root cuttings and things like that .but you got to have soil.
we 're kicking out out of our back one and a half .we are almost done with the kick out .we just talked about the legs and how to use them keeping tight stomach muscles .now , what do we do with our arms , our head , and our upper body on the kick out , okay .here 's what you do.
hi , today we 're talking about how to pick out a healthy parakeet .so if you wanted a parakeet and you want to make sure that you 've got certain things , you want bright eyes , they should be chirping , they should seem lively , interested in what you are doing .they should have , you know their seer which is their nose should look clear .they should n't seem like they have any respiratory problems .their feet and nails should look clean and without any scaling .their tail feathers should be long and bright .they should look just overall they should seem active .if the bird is sitting on the perch fluffed up uninterested , all the other birds are flying around and.
alright , so now we have all our pots planted and where do we put them , what kind of light do they need ?generally i would put the cactus in the sunniest window , probably like a south facing window , they 're going to want a lot of sun .these fleshier leaves are , in nature , they 're around more water.
i see that there are three category of writers .i define them as being an author , a writer , and a story teller .an author , i like to classify as somebody who writes great works of literature .these are the well-known authors of our time and our past .then , there is the writer .i see that a writer is somebody who has an incredible command of mechanics of the english language .then , you get the third class , which is were i like to put myself which is a storyteller .somebody who conveys a story and a message and information to people in the form of a story in such a way in that it captivates them , it entertains them , it influences them , and it makes them want to turn the page to see what happens next .that is the real differences between those three as i see them .
also we 're going to use a gold or light topaz color .in this bead what we 'll be doing is using again , the black for the base.
now , when you look at reducing the amount of dust in your home , the first areas you might want to consider , are actually the exterior to your home .keeping walkways and garages , keeping those swept and keeping those clean , keeping driveways and sidewalks and entrances to your home , keeping those swept , and keeping those pressure washed , and as clean as possible , and doing that periodically , it will keep you from tracking a lot of that to the interior of the house .now , and depending on the conditions , and the environment you live in , despite all the exterior cleaning that you do , and periodic maintenance you can do , you 're still going to get dust , so the next best defense , is actually in your return air filter , and as you look at this filter , this is actually a pleated , a high efficiency filter , and what this does , this is designed to actually collect a lot of the dust , that may come into your house , so.
, we are going to know learn retreat and seal .so starting with the position of the last punch , remember you are sinking the weight into both legs ,left leg is bent .most of your weight is on your left , core strength , strong arms .you are going to go ahead and punch a little bit longer with that right hand as the palm comes up , twisting the spine and the waist , left hand under right elbow .twist the spine and the waist again in the other direction as you start to sit back .right hand over left elbow .sitting back in to your legs , hands come right about to chest level , turn the palms .and you ?re going to start to shift the weight forward again back to the left as you push .this push has a little different trajectory then the pushes we 've done in the past .this one has the fingers pointing forward .so just imagine in martial arts , this is where you would go for the person 's throat .now i 'm going to show a little bit quicker and a little bit smoother .so from the punch , retreat and seal and push .
in this case uke is going to take a stance and is going to attack nage .okay , in this case , as soon as uke picks up his hand to attack , nage , irimi enters to the front straight in .let 's show them that again , and the most important part of this movement is that you catch it really early before the arm comes down .in aikido we do n't want to have a collision .
and we 're looking at the length.
now on the prosumer level cameras and the higher end of the consumer line , they have a two level switch that is where you push the button to take the picture .you could push it half way , and it will focus .and then you press it the rest of the way and it will shoot .and when this camera does it , it shoots out sort of a red focusing light that 's got infrared built into it so that it can see it even in the dark .it 'll be able to focus .and this camera will take a picture in complete darkness and give a complete expert exposure .and most of them will do that .other things that are important are a manual focus so you can manually focus .and most prosumers have that , very few consumer cameras have that .
okay , in this first clip i just want to teach you or show you the proper ways to get started before we start the project .okay , before we even get started even talking about staining or whitewashing , you might want to have a big area to work in , or at least an area that you do n't make a mess .alright , so clean out some areas , move some furniture and put down your tarp , and that 's where you 're going to have your work area .you might also want to have an old work bench .something that you do n't mind if it gets dirty or out of place .and remember also : always wear old clothes .throw on some old jeans , some sneakers .good project for the kids to get them involved , too .so this is about just painting , having fun , but remember these are some harsh chemicals sometimes.
i do celebrate espats and sabbaths .which an espat would be a full moon , so i do a full moon ceremony where i thank the goddess that i 've worked with for almost twenty years , for her help during the month .and that is just her day , i do not ask for anything as money , or love or health .it is just specifically to honor her .on the sabbaths , which are major holidays , there are eight in a year .it 's a little more intricate type of ritual , because you go with the time of the year that it is .so say if it was mid summer , i would decorate my altar with alot of flowers and probably throw a few faeries in there just because , and go from there .the theme would have summer colors to it , i would be wearing lighter clothing , because i do wear clothing .i do not go sky clad , which means naked .there have been times that i have , although i really watched to make sure the neighbors were n't peeking over the back fence .so i kind of stopped that , especially since there 's a child nextdoor.
and the next thing i wanted to talk about was your combination passes .now you can start to get really creative with these now that you have gotten control of your double back handsprings and your back tucks .you can start really doing any combination that you can think of .the first that i would recommend is your double back handspring back tuck .the same problems as before , you want to make sure you 're seeing it as one , one tumbling pass , not all this separate tricks that goes into it .keeping the rhythm with it , remembering and paying attention to your head and hand positions , making sure that those are where they should be .and just making sure you 're getting controlling your power .this is a really big problem i see as people move on to harder combinations .they start going and build up a really big momentum , and they 'll just fly up in the air and they do n't know how to control that much power .so you need to make sure you 're taking it slow , not going too advanced or too fast .keeping it under your control , really paying attention to all the proper techniques .as you start doing these combinations , thinking up of your own passes to do , you need to keep in mind what we talked at the beginning , the mental set .you need to make sure you 're really thinking about what you 're going to do before you do it .organizing it in your mind , and knowing what you do , so that you do n't get half way through it and still wonder well what am i doing .you need to make sure that 's under your control , you know what you 're doing so that you can really pay attention to your body .especially your head position as you are throwing all of these different movements , and they 're requiring your head to go every which way .so it 's important to organize that mindset , pay attention to your positions , especially your head and your hands .and really think about it as you are doing these combinations .
and in the cave , which is pretty interesting , is there were thirteen figures .there was a man who had antlers on , there was a pregnant female , and eleven people around them .now what this translates to would be the god and the goddess , and eleven followers , or a coven .and the goddess is normally shown pregnant because she stands for fertility .and the god , which i have an example , of kernunos , who is the horned god , or the hunter , he is shown with the antlers .and also sometimes you will see him dancing .i know it 's a really tiny picture , and stuff .and normally you 'll see him nude , and people figure he 's barbaric or whatnot .and normally they will show him with an erect fallace , showing that he is also part of the fertility , a hunt .and , i do n't know .there was a cave.
in addition to silver foil you can find silver comes in several forms .this thin piece of silver is what is called silver bezel .it can be applied to a bead , or it can be applied to a piece of pyrex or a piece of quartz , to use in a fuming technique which i 'll show you later .basically you can use again a pair of regular scissors to cut the size of bezel that you need .silver also comes , wow , that 's pretty sticky .silver also comes in a leaf form which is a very , very fine form .also comes in wire , you can use a silver wire to wrap around your bead .in addition to silver there are other metals that you can use when you 're making glass beads .you can use gold leaf , which of course is more expensive , or you can even use palladium .also , you can use copper , and you can use copper wire , in order , when you heat copper up.
what we are going to discuss and demonstrate is the simple technique to tying the butterfly knot .the butterfly 's purpose is to form a locking loop in the middle of any rope .the butterfly knot can take the place of a figure eight on a bite or the bowline on a bite .to form the butterfly knot we simply lay the rope across the palm of our hand and we are going to wrap or form three loops around our palm to the inside of that first wrap .we form the first one to the inside and hold it , we form the second one to the inside of the first two and hold it .then we grab the middle one lift it , cross over the most inner one and then pass that through the whole that we formed and pull that tight until we form what 's called a butterfly knot .to finish off the knot we simply pull it and pop the knot to where we have what looks like two wings , it 's self locking forming the butterfly knot .this can be attached to any object or anchor point , taking the place of the figure eight on the bite , or the bowline on the bite .great knot to know in addition to those two knots .the butterfly knot .
okay .now , we 're going to go over on how to catch your nunchuck.
i 'm going to talk to you about time budgeting in your home video post-production studio .time is money as i said before .time budgeting is very important , especially when it comes to distractions .when you 're budgeting your time , you want to make sure that you 're not overextending yourself or putting in way too many hours on a project where you 're only contractually obligated to put in a certain amount .it 's very easy to get involved on a project , especially in an industry like this which is creative by nature .as an editor , it 's very easy to spend two , three , five hours on ten to twenty seconds of video , but when the client is expecting a full video which is going to be three minutes in length , you 've already used up too much time on a little portion and now you 're going to have to really rush through the rest of your project .this means you could be sacrificing the quality , the pacing , and the overall look of the video by the end .and the ultimate goal , obviously , is to impress them and leave them wanting more so they 'll call you up for the next job again .time budgeting is one of the most difficult things to get your head around , and it does take a lot of personal experience and at least one or two or three projects with one specific client to really know what you 're in for .i would make estimates very liberally so that if you get things done ahead of schedule , you feel like you accomplished something , and you got it done ahead of time , and now you know for the next time .
indoor rock climbing gym , in wilmington , north carolina .today , we 're going to discuss , stretching your rock climbing shoes .stretching a rock climbing shoe , for the most part , is not a possibility .breaking your climbing shoe in properly , may be something that you 're looking to do .climbing shoes are aggressively tight .generally , you 're going to have a rock climbing shoe.
when you  ve taken eddy hopping to the limit , as far as you  re willing to push it and as far as you  re willing to uh , feel like you have safety downstream , its time to get out and scout from shore .and that  s a way to look at a rapid , you can get out and actually walk along the bank of the river and look at the rapid that you are about to run or maybe you decide not to run and really get a lot of good information about the rapid , about what  s coming up , the hazards and all that .scouting from shore requires a couple of things .number one , it requires you to be conservative enough and to be , uh , have good enough judgment to decide to scout from shore and not just sort of take every rapid as they come .some boaters paddle that way and that  s how you can get into big trouble , is not knowing when to scout .the second thing it requires is a shore that you can get to , some rapids are in vertical side gorges , very difficult , to nearly impossible to scout from shore .and it that case , unless you are a real expert , probably the judgment there is just to , to portage around the whole section and not even consider it .but in cases where you have a good access to the shore and you can see the rapid well , uh , what you want to do , is just walk down the shore , as you  re going down , look for hazards , look for routes , look for ways down the rapids , that maybe avoid those hazards .often there will be one or two really major issues in the rapid that you have to watch out for.
we 're here in wasatch , the beautiful wasatch mountains of utah .here to talk about adaptive sports .and how snowshoeing can fit in with a lot of people 's adaptive life .okay , in snowshoeing , much like snow skiing being able to stop is very important .and not being able to stop is intimidating .so , when you get to the top of a hill , or your coming to the edge of someplace and you want to stop .it 's always important if you 're walking or jogging at a pretty good pace , that like anything you want to shorten the steps to decelerate .and the shorter you do that , and also be aware of over lapping .then they can come to more of a stop .as opposed to the longer strides .it 's harder to come to a stop when you are taking longer strides .so it 's really just a , kind of a down shifting so to speak .but also being aware of the over lap .cause you do n't want to have them trip , especially if their coming to the edge of a creek or something like that .
now one of the neatest things that you can do with this instrument is circular breathe .that 's actually buzzing while breathing in through your nose and playing at the same time .right now , we 'll go over the basics of how to do that .first of all , while you 're buzzing into the instrument and you begin to run out of breath .i 'd say you had about a quarter of your lung capacity left .you want to fill your cheeks with air , close off your throat and while you do , puff the air out of your cheeks while you 're playing .not with your hands , but while you 're playing the instrument , and breathe in through your nose in short bursts as you puff the air out of your cheeks .let 's give this a try with just a basic monotone through the didgeridoo so you can get an idea of what it looks like .( demo ) notice the long duration that i was able to play this thing and.
the stylist or the service provider know what they 're going to be doing on the client , what the client 's doing , the time of the service .this would be the client name here and all of this is a list that the client has previously purchased .down here on the bottom is going to be a list of say the color formulation that was used the last time , the type of cutting technique that was used , even the polish color .we like to write all of that down and keep a great record of that so that we can duplicate it for the next time that the client comes back into the salon .watch our next segment on delivery.
remember how to do your legs , your right legs go back and before it hits the ground you alternate with your left leg and make sure that when either leg goes back it goes right behind the other .and always remember you will have your own style no matter what kind of dance you do .like this for instance the roger rabbit , i have my own style for this dance , now every person does n't do it the same.
i just want to talk a little bit about half pipe safety .half pipes are definitely the most popular feature of any park .obviously with the olympics being big and x-games being real big everybody wants to jump right into the pipe .it is really important though just to scope out the scene before you drop in , once you arrive to the half pipe you can take a look around and see how many people are waiting to drop in , who is going next ,who looks like they know what they are doing.
how do you tell if your hermit crab is pregnant ?you ca n't .that 's a simple answer .hermit crabs , unfortunately , we do n't understand how they breed , we do n't understand how they reproduce , the environmental conditions , the various needs , things like that .we ca n't even tell if they 're pregnant .there 's no way to know .and if your hermit crab does happen to get pregnant , by some bizarre way or reason , you 'll probably never even know .and , you 'll never be the wiser .because hermit crabs have to lay their eggs , he 's going to come out for me here .hermit crabs have to lay their eggs in the ocean .they 're so microscopic that they feed on micro nutrients in the surf .we ca n't provide that , so .honestly , there 's no way to tell if your hermit crab is pregnant , and you 'll never be the wiser .so , just enjoy your hermit crab for what he is , and do n't worry about it .
in this clip , we 're going to do the third progression of shomaplutachari .and that step , it 's similar --it has similar elements to the first two .first we 're going to jump , then we 're going to step , shomo , and jump to the same side again , and then hop .so we 're going to jump , shomo , jump , hop .one , two , three , four , one , two , three , four .the hands are going to do the windshield motion again , but as you step , they go back to the same side .so , one , two , and then again , three and stay .one , change , change , stay .so on the hop , you 're not going to switch your hands again .you 're going to keep your hands on this side .so it 's only one , two , three changes in the hands .six , seven , eight .
now , i 'm going to show you some reasons why your saxophone wo n't play .first of all , i 'll start off with our neck and our neck octave mechanism here .this is probably the biggest reason for your horn not playing .basically , if this key up here is leaking whatsoever , the rest of your horn is going to play off .it will actually , will not play at all .some other things that can cause your horn not to play is you could have some bent keys , you can have just a pad that is just flat worn out where the leather has broke away.
now let 's dive right into the second measure of the eight line right here .starts off with b , slurs , second position , shift , right up , and now let 's take a look at my hands , so it shifts , to second position at the g sharp right on up and it is a very , it is just a half step away shift .
a honeydew is so good when it 's riped , okay .first thing you want to do with is smell it.
it is x and a red , much like blaze .however , fireball is a little different .fireball is a sorcery , but you may pay the x damage and have it deal to a single creature or play .however , fireball has the extra added thing that you may deal damage to multiple targets .so you would divide that damage evenly among the targets , but you also have to pay one additional colorless mana for each additional target .so , if you were targeting two things you would have to pay one colorless and the red , and then you would start counting mana for the x.
alright , we 're talking about auto focus modes here with the canon 40d .and the first auto focus mode that we want to talk about is the one shot mode .to get to that mode here , again we 're going to select the af-drive button and then scroll through to one shot .and the one shot mode , basically , is primarily for still subjects .and what you 'll want to do is take your camera and go ahead and focus it .focus the camera on or aim the camera at your subject , press the shutter button down and the camera will pull a focus on that item on the subject .and once the camera has pulled a focus , what you can do is recompose the shot .maybe you want to move the subject off to the right or to the left to give it better perspective or more natural perspective and that focus will be locked and it 's not going to change .so one shot is primarily for relatively still objects or still photography and achieves a locked focus one time , until you initiate another focus by pressing the shutter button once again .
now lastly , you want to make sure that you have your cleaning products in a safe place .before i get started with cleaning here , i just want to lastly explain to you .how important that is .you know , how important that is .those of you , who have young children .who can get into cupboards .you want to make sure that your products are always up high , in the cupboard somewhere .if you do n't have storage up high , to put your hold , your holder like this .then make sure , you either have those locks .that come around your handles on lower cupboards .so that children can not get into them .but you want , there 's also some where they have the round knobs .that go onto door handles .if you do n't have them close enough together , that you can put the hooks around them .but any kind of locks , any kind of lock .you want to make sure , if you 're stirring your chemicals , down low .make sure you have those safety precautions .also it 's a good idea to have poison control number , somewhere close to hand .for any kind of emergency .i would definitely recommend , you know what that poison control number is .and where to find that in emergency .and as far as the child locks , you can get them at toy r us .pretty much target , places like that .for a few dollars .
now you can also get into some specialty grinders .this tormek is a very good unit .it is what they call a slow speed grinder or a wet grinder .there is usually water in this area here .this tool.
what this has shown us is basically how to put a sky in and make the clouds form by using a paper towel to randomly place clouds in .also showed us how we can grow a forest with just two or three colors and grow it up to the sky using wet and wet processes .and we can make planking with vertical holes so to speak to gives a suggestion of vertical wood and more wet and wet with a couple of colors in here ; character in the fence and then scrape marks for the snow that 's covering the tops of these fence posts .and then to put some more interest rather than having a big white area , we put just the most subtle violets down here in a wet and wet arrangement which started out just as clear water with a little bit of brown in it.
so the next ting that we are going to do is we are going to apply some bronzer .i am going to use my kabuki brush for this.
so when you do the sides , one thing you have to remember is no pressure to speak of .you 're going to feel like you 're just barely hitting the surface.
alright.
okay , so one of the other things to kinda keep in mind , what we did here is we just did , we recorded on a track-by-track basis , you can always record multiple tracks at a time so you could set it up to where you have one and two go and one being a vocal , one of them being a guitar .one thing you might run into if you 're tryin 'to lay down say two or three tracks with two or three people , as far as monitoring , you 're not going to want to use the speakers for that .it 's really just kinda good for playback where everybody can hear , you 're going to want to use the headphones.
what this would do it will allow you to see like here what you are going to need , what connectors you are going to use that should compliment your plants that you have already created .it just gives you a better visual sense and also helps you give you a schematically of what you are going to cut.
and this , it 's really important with the hands ,because it 's all we have to tell her with , is that we go here on 5 , all together , 5.and then here , i 'm really making sure that i 'm leading this right hand forward .so she knows she 's not traveling her weight back , because i 'm really kind of making it obvious that we 're really staying in place .so we 've gone here , then we can do the 5 again , then when it comes back , it 's coming back.
now we are going to finish our horse .holding it so that the sink fold is on the bottom , that 's the base of our horse , we are going to open the tail , the point that does n't have a little triangle folded down .open it up.
to have a character , what you 'll need is a character sheet and dice to do the rolls that make up your character 's ability scores .once you have a character , someone will be elected as the dugeon master .that person will host the game and be the primary storyteller .you 'll go thu a story .lots of stuff can happen .you 'll have a chance to get a feel for your character.
hi , i 'm les whitley .i 'd like to talk to you right now about building your abdominal muscles .the abdominal muscles , just like any other muscle in the body , requires training and effort .to train those abdominal muscles through a variety of ranges of motion for a complete and overall total development requires time focus and effort on your part .one of the main exercises that 's used is the crunch or the sit-up in a forward motion which trains the rectus-abdominus or the center portion of the abdominal muscles .the abdominal muscles are part of your overall core which involves your obliques as well as your lower back .for stabilization of your torso in all activities that you are doing .whether it 's walking , running , sitting , standing ; overall proper posture .the abdominal muscles and midsection should be trained appropriately using exercises that fit and meet your needs .training the midsection as a whole through functional exercises will give you an overall better stable environment to operate performing sports or just general daily activities .training that midsection together to operate as a whole and part of your overall body will give you the development for that overall toned midsection that everyone looks for .
lets put our ice in a glass here .we 're going to do a half of a shot of tequila .one half of a shot of triple sec .one half of a shot of southern comfort .which is some where around here .do n't quite have that yet .it 's alright.

the kids will love that .they always like making snakes .you want to roll it like a snake and then crunch it so that it 's nice and tight .you 're doing this because you 're going to use two of them , and you 're going to make kind of a chain with them so that the sound will filter through the two of them .there that 's about the right length .ok , we 're going to make another one .we 're going to roll it like a snake .of course , it does n't have to be even , because after all , you are just going to crunch it up .once we have it rolled we 're going to take the two.
okay , now we 've drained the coconut and here 's the coconut water .and so now we want to get inside this little guy and get the meat out .and the hole was pretty easy to find , and as you see , it did n't take a lot of effort .and this right now is , is probably about the , the most effort .now i use a hatchet .other people use meat cleavers .the most important thing is the safety .being that you have to hold this coconut while you do it , you want to make sure you do n't chop off any fingers .but what we 're going to do is we 're ,we see where the hole is.
now in this clip we 're going to take you to a oberek in a promenade dance position .it 's going to start off with a two basic oberek steps 1.
so the plants are excellent , excellent thing to implement if we need more vitality because this is your real life force .so this is the chi .plants cleanse air , so they produce a very good vital feeling in the room .so recently nasa did two years research on plants because in the space there , they have a lot of equipment of course .and they discover that there are some common house plants actually cleanse the air from all kinds of pollution including electro-magnetic pollution .and one of the plants that cleanses air is this golden pothos .this is an excellent plant to have in the house .so there are some other plants in the list as well .so but also , it needs a little bit of color .so we need a little bit of red , so some green , some water in the environment as we showed you before in those walden pond , beautiful pictures .so that all helps to bring , to boost that vitality .
this is called a dolly .when the clothes are finished and bagged and the initial ticket that i had the number of item and the day it was to be picked up is attached to the bag .it is then put on the dolly according to alphabetical of the first name .we like to have the last name first on all the garments and.
your expectations are critical to his or her development .everything they do , as i said in the beginning , do n't expect a whole lot .scribbles are a whole lot and they 're a wonderful thing and that gives them the initiative and motivation to learn so.
what i 'm going to do next is i 'm going to show you how to lay a hi hat over what we already recorded .i 'm going to go into my same track.
well for me personally i started teaching aerobics classes and when i was teaching my aerobic classes.
alright the drink we 're about to make is called a rum rickey .go ahead and put some ice in a glass here .and we 'll measure out one and a half ounces of light rum and follow that up with half an ounce of lime juice , one teaspoon of sugar syrup , and let 's just shake that up a little bit .alright , make sure you have a good seal on your shaker and your glass there .you do n't want to get it all over like i just did .alright , go ahead and pour that in to the glass.
another option for creating collage pieces , is to not just freehand draw a shape , but to actually establish a repeated pattern shape .so i 've made these patterns out of a little bit thicker stock paper ; this one maybe not so thick .but i like the pattern that i created here , and that way i can make repeated multiples of this same pattern , if that 's the way i 'm choosing to work inside of my collage .so it basically works the same way patterns , for pattern dress making or anything else is concern , and you just sort of lay it out , and trace around the edge that you want to use it for .now also keeping in mind , like what area of the piece you 're using , see how that 's going over that white edge , i may not want that edge actually to happen , but.
in this clip i 'm going to talk about how to speak with a french accent .well you can get a book and a cd.
so now we 're going to start tracing it .it 's got some lines in it , roof line and windows .you do n't want to spend a whole lot of time tracing .you want to spend your time painting .but you do need to get in a definite areas that are going to be hard-edged .areas that are soft-edged are not so critical .this is mainly just a guide .you 're not going to draw in everything .roof line here , church back here .the street and the shadows of the street , more windows and more windows .got lots of windows on this building , so we work it all in , a little pole , street lights , etcetera .
for this demonstration , i am going to use a pen to signify my bit that i am going to be cutting with .if i get ready to make my cut.
there 's nothing to do ?oh yes there is .okay , what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to gently grab her leg .i 'm going to roll my side over here .you always want to roll towards the leg that is being locked .not this way .this is helping her .not a good idea .now what i want to do , i want to roll this way .okay , so i 'm going to go ahead and roll .and while i 'm rolling , try to spread the legs open .now that her legs are open , hopefully during the rolling she will get disoriented , and i could go ahead and manipulate her legs to spread them open .and when spread open.
well a septum is the divider between the right and the left chambers of the nose inside .it 's made from cartilage and bone .it is frequently traumatized which causes it to grow crookedly or it may even fracture from a car wreck or maybe from a fall on the playground when you were a child or even from trauma coming down the birth canal being born .all of these things can cause the septum to grow crookedly .it can have an effect on the breathing in one chamber of the nose .when it does cause nasal obstruction.
make sure you give this a little stir right here .look at that .yes , it 's going .it 's going .set this right here .now technically , we use basically white rice for everything because with the mixture of these two combinations , it 's not going to be white for longer .if we wanted to make white rice , that 's whole other cooking story right there.
this drink is called dr.
you may think it is done , and you are perfect and it is all been done , but there is always more to find , there is always more to discover .it is really your job in your craft as an actor to keep practicing all the time .you want to inculcate good habits , good work habits in yourself .that makes you a confident actor , it makes you someone who they want to hire .so , keep practicing all the time , keep making yourself get better and better .ask friends for help , analyze your performance .it is your duty to yourself and you might say to your art to keep on practicing all the time , so make yourself do it .
alright now , we 're going to be -- go over on how to hold your nunchucks.
going to talk about grip pressure for someone who uses more of a body swing with less hands .in general , if you have more of a body swing , upper body , entire body , if you 've been working on a swing where you 're more connected , which means your arms are against your body and your body is leading , the big muscles are leading the smaller muscles , in general , for that kind of a swing , swing theory , swing thought , a tighter grip .now that could be the four to six , it could be seven to eight in terms of grip pressure but the reason you want it a little tighter with a body , upper body connected type of a swing is that you want to make sure that when you turn your body , that the club , if you held it very light , would lag behind , getting stuck .we 've heard that expression a lot lately .so if you hold it very light with a body swing , there 's more of an opportunity for your hands to lag behind or even open up .but if you held it tighter , perhaps a six to eight grip pressure , when you turn into the ball , it 's going to move with you .as you can imagine , let 's say you had a cast on each hand and each wrist , as you turn your body into the ball , if you had a cast , you could see how it moves with you .but if you 're holding it really light with that upper body connected swing , hold it real light and turn , the club could lag behind .so in general , if you are a connected upper body , not very much hands in the swing , the grip pressure should be stronger .
now i 'm going to teach you a frontside 180.
basically after you go through that other stuff you just slide in like this make sure it lines up.
that 's basically the main thing .the designer has a lot to do with it because when the designer builds his name , the more expensive the handbags get .way more expensive .that 's why you see a lot of bags out there that are fake compared to real ones because a lot of people ca n't afford the real ones .the real ones can cost up to like $ 30 ,000 .another reason why they 're really expensive is because some designers like to put diamonds on them.
okay , now i 've strung one half of the necklace with all the different disk beads and we want to go ahead , because this is a simple type of bead , we 're going to do a centerpiece .so right now , i 'm at the half point of , and ready to go ahead and design my centerpiece .what i 'm going to do is probably put a couple silver beads on each side of it so that it can dangle nice and it wo n't be stuck in between the beads.
so i am going to go ahead and pull him out .as you can see , we are starting to turn white down the middle and such .i told you we were going to re drizzle.
some of the wood you can find or even buy is very , very spectacular .we 're going to take a look at some of these woods here that we 've got , and they 're kind of from all around the world .first one i want to show you here , is a piece of wood from here .it was , actually , it was in the river bottom close to my house .and this a piece of box elder .it 's a soft maple , but it 's a box elder burl .and how you can tell the burl is , all the little spikes that are on the outside of the tree .and this usually has bark on it .but that 's what makes all the pretty , wonderful eyes in here .even this little piece of found wood , we can turn into a little bit ...a bowl , and have a nice , little project out of it .here 's a piece of myrtle burl .now this comes from oregon , and it 's a bigger piece , and you can ...it 's hard to see , but you can see all the figure that 's in this .and very , very , very nice woods .there 's burls from all around the world .one of the most expensive is amboina burl .comes ...and amboina is one of my favorites .it comes from the far east , and it 's just a gorgeous burl .and it costs probably almost twenty to thirty dollars a pound .very expensive .this is a fun piece , this is called mazer birch , comes from finland .you can see the little lines , you can see a little bit of wax on the end .all the figure in it .some of the exotics that you can turn , tulip wood , very fun .king wood .now most of these exotics , you have to go to a specialty place that sells exotics , but , the exotics are a lot of fun .and it does n't take much to make a ...you know , this one you can get two pins out of easily .even though it 's quite expensive , you can get two projects out of it .if you want to do a plate , here again , here 's a ...this is babinga , and it 's actually ...you can see the figure in this .it 's just going to be a gorgeous platter when we get it done .one of my favorites is birds-eye maple .has all the little tiny eyes .just a gorgeous wood from here in the states .now as you can see , we 're going to have a lot of fun with this lathe , and you can turn anything , even found wood .you know , in the firewood pile , i found some great pieces of wood .just take it in on your band saw , cut it up and see what you 've got .
now we 're are going to discuss the hand tool .the hand tool can be found in our tool box here and course it 's hard to miss because it has a little hand right here .if we click on it you can see that this is just a move tool for just grabbing your screen and just moving it around .but i find this really an inefficient way to work .let 's max out my screen here , well actually lets zoom in here because you ca n't use your hand tool when its maxed out .lets say i have my brush tool selected .i 'm going to hit b for my brush tool .well if i hit the space bar the hand automatically comes up.
so i 'm going to go ahead and start on this other side and what we 're going to use is a pigment .pigment is loose eyeshadow and it 's pure color.
how much fabric do i need ?because i do n't want to buy too much when i go to the store .well , if i 'm going to make one without sleeves , i simply double the dimension of my upper thigh .i happen to know the dimension of my upper thigh is twenty-four inches , so that means i need forty-eight inches of material .that 's one yard and one foot .now if i 'm going to add sleeves to that , i need the dimension of my upper bicep , which is on my arm is fifteen inches , and i 'm going to add a little more to make some room in the armpit , so make it eighteen inches .so forty-eight plus eighteen , so.
learning how to sing , if you do n't have a natural ability and you want to learn how to sing you can .you can get vocal lessons if you want to learn on your own .i would just try to emulate the singers that you really like and try to sing like them .and try to definitely if you can stay on key.
i have this thing sewn down now .in the previous clip i 've shown you how to sew this closed and if you remember the original hem underneath was a blind stitch.

and there 's the hard brush , which almost everyone has one of these .this is something that in the winter time , when your horses are very hairy , you can use this all over their body .in the summer time , i reserve this for either horses of mine that i know like a lot of pressure.
i 'm going to play the song with the right hand but just concentrate on the left hand pattern until you actually know how it goes .this is the verse .that 's how it goes .that 's the pattern , it repeats itself , very simple .now i 'm going to play through the entire verse , it repeats itself twice just so you can get the basic idea of how it goes .back to c.so basically , like the right hand , it goes back to c in the original position where you started the song and from there you can go into the next part of the song , again , starting with the chord of c .
so the next tool that you 're going to need is going to be your cutting tools .these you can pretty much decide on what works best for you , what 's your most comfortable with .i preferably always have on hand , three different types of cutting tools , or you 're never going to be sure exactly what you 're going to need , so just have them on hand .a pair of , good pair of cutting scissors , paper scissors are really important because you want some nice , clean edges on some part.
i 'm beau timkin .i 'm master sake sommelier and in this segment on daiginjo , i 'd like to speak to how daiginjo 's actually crafted , hand crafted .because i 'll be honest , there is sake and there is daiginjo when it comes down to manufacturing .they literally treat daigingo differently .it 's almost quarantined because they 're going to such extremes in trying to create such a nuance , subtle product .now , that said , they will typically , brewers will typically brew daiginjo sort of at the end of the season or after they 've worked out the kinks of the beginning of the year , the equipment and be honest , they use equipment different than other equipment for the other categories of sake , for daiginjo .now , what do i mean by that ?typically when you press sake , they 'll use a big air bladdered machine , it looks like an accordion , has a wonderful sound , dadadadadadadada..and it presses sake together , all the fluid together , and all the in fermented rice particles stick in this machine and.
so , with the rim click , you actually have quite a plethora of sounds at your fingertips .just moving the sticks slightly can evoke a starkly different sound .so , i want you to listen to the difference between the position that i had the stick in and the sound that it made the first time versus when i move the stick , just slightly move the bead slightly towards the center of the drum .you can hear that the pitch is a lot lower and as you play around , this is one of your most sensitive strokes .you can get that first sound , you get that deeper sound.
and you have this one over here .it also has corner cuts but it also has a nice little indian design on the bottom .and this one is almost like a shadow box .you have design , but yet you have a shadow box with real indian pottery .and then the one over here of the clown , she is in an oval.
ladies and gentlemen , now let 's get on to the next section of the shaolin long fist .starting from previous section .right hand in ; one , left hand in ; two , step back ; three , chop ,okay you 're going to bring this hand up , go this hand , raise your knee , go down , punch out , turn , one , two , three , four , five to six one pull in , seven , eight , one , two , three , four .okay .ladies and gentlemen let 's do it again .starting from the previous clip , down , one , two , three , chop , hands , one , two , three , turn , one , two , three , four , five , six , pull in , seven , eight , one two ,elbow , punch .okay , let 's go again .from here , one , two , three , chop , one , two , three , down , turn , one , two , three , four , five , six pull in , seven , one , two , elbow , punch .ladies and gentlemen this concludes this section .

there we 've got our stuffing in the bed .
one of my favorite subjects is the art of faking which is also known as an indirect attack .there is a variety of fakes .we know that faking wants to gain us time and gain us distance .this particular fake strategy is called position fake .watch this .joining us from pro star mixed martial arts is mr.
this is the first step , to weigh the ingredients .the second step is to mix the ingredients , the third step is to let the dough rest and the fourth step is cutting the dough , which is what i 'm doing right now .we 're going to weigh this bread ; this is called our seven grain bread .the ingredients come from germany .what we 're going to do is , we 're going to cut it.
we are going to shift the weight again into the right leg and bring the left knee into the chest and over her , crossing over to the right leg .this is called gerudasana .now the arms , let 's take your arms wide , and then bring your left arm underneath your right .so you 're going to cross at the elbows , left under the right and then continue wrapping if that is comfortable for you .if it is not you can just simply hug the hands around the shoulders , show that way .that 's an option here , just so you feel the shoulder blades separating off the spine .it 's a nice stretch , especially since we have been doing all this forward lifting , heart lift and elevation to get some nice stretch in those back muscles .squeeze the inner thighs and then pay attention to the back foot .now to come out of this just simply bring the arms over head , inhale , take the left leg to the floor and then exhale to tadasana and then come right into the second side .inhale the arms overhead and exhale and in one swoop let 's take the right arm under the right leg over .concentrating on your center or solar plexus.
now , to give the sticks extra support , i 'm going to show you how to tie them after we 've glued them together , and to make a knot so that they 'll stay nice and strong , even if there 's a strong wind .so we go ahead , and we take the string , and leave a little bit extra on the end ; hanging out , so that we 'll have some room to tie it , and just go back and forth in a crossover motion ; making sure that you catch both sticks .you can switch direction , you can go over from the left side , or over from the right side , and just keep weaving back and forth , until you see that there is very little movement on the sticks ; that they 're nice and strong and kept together .now , the sticks are going to be placed into the dibbles that will be glued on the plastic , so it 's not necessary to make it so that they do n't move at all .but usually , even with a good knot , you can get them pretty tight , and you probably wo n't see too much movement on the sticks .but just make sure that they 're nice and tight ; stuck together .then , after you 've gone through a few times , take the last bit of string , and the other end , and make a couple of knots on top of each other , and this should help you keep the sticks nice and strong and in place .as long as you 're using a good piece of plastic , you 'll see that the kite will be nice and sturdy .after we 've put the string around the sticks , and we 've cut the ends , what we do is we take a little bit of glue ;here i 'm.
this is a critical thing .you plan on how you 're going to say i love you .whether you are a man or a woman , you set up the scenario .i am going to tell this person today that i love him or her .we will go to a place that is quiet , we 're not going to a place that has this loud band rocking in the back and.
hi , my name is tres hoyt .i 'm here at asel art supply in austin , texas .i 'm going to talk today about graffiti lettering .graffiti lettering is a pretty broad topic .there are probably , literally hundreds of different styles of graffiti hand style .you go around the world and it will change .you can go around the country and it will change .but i have here , three examples of three different basic alphabets .and these are really , really basic form alphabet letters .so i 'm going to go ahead and do this third one for you all .so you can see the strokes that i make .one of the easiest ways to hand style , is to just practice .you can find different fonts and copy them .or you can take your basic , basic alphabet .and just start tweaking the letters as you see fit to little positions that you like .i like to work on graph paper .so i try to keep most of my letters in a consistent size .and i do n't start drifting at angles when i write .but you can use either a brush type pen for flared effects .or just regular graphic pens or pretty much any kind of marker you want .but here we go.
another good variation to learn from the front side nose slide is not just popping out forward , but learning how to front side nose slide and roll out fakie .the difference is , when you 're coming out , you 're going to want to roll and land fakie , rolling away .so what you 're going to want to do is , ollie into a front side nose slide , remembering to keep your feet over the front side of the board , because you 're going to put most of your weight on the nose .doing your front side nose slide , and then coming away and rolling fakie .this is a really good trick as a setup trick to get turned around sometimes in a line or skating .it 's just another way that you can come off .after you learn how to front side nose slide fakie , there 's a lot of tricks that you can learn from this one.
hello , i 'm sabrina karges and i 've owned and operated tko , teleprompter computer operators , for over twenty years .and i 'm here to talk to you about how to be a teleprompter operator and business owner .what is a teleprompter ?it 's a display device that prompts the person speaking with an electronic visual text of a speech or a script .using a teleprompter is similar to using cue cards .the reflective glass is script or speech for the talent and that would be me .the glass is reflecting from the monitor .the monitor is being fed the script electronically from a computer where the operator is controlling the speed and feed of the script and speech .this application frees the speaker from having to look down at notes so they can look directly into the camera lens .cue cards would be placed away from the camera .the first teleprompter was created in the 1950 's and was a simple mechanical device that was paper fed .jess oppenheimer , producer of.

sending stuff back home is also an option .on some of my tours you go from places where it is cold to places where it is hot .and so you start going to the post offices in town and sending home the cold weather gear you do n't need.
clancy rose : all right .so now we 're going to talk about the beans that you are going to use for your espresso , for your con panna .so one of the common misconceptions about espresso roast is that coffee is roasted darker for espresso , which is n't necessarily true .you could use any coffee that you want for your espresso shots .what makes an espresso an espresso is the process that you go through to make the espresso shot , and it 's the extraction process of the espresso and the ratio of coffee to water .in an espresso shot , the ratio of coffee to water is a lot higher than it would be in a normal cup of coffee .
suspension is the opposite of retention .in retention we 're holding our breath , in suspension what we are doing is exhaling the , all the air completely from the lungs and then suspending our breath , keeping the body completely empty .while retention is being full , suspension is being completely empty .and after breathing out , holding this for a count of three , five , ten whatever works for your own body .getting used to having all the air expelled from your lungs may take a little while .it 's quite difficult to have that feeling sometimes of being completely empty.
okay , the second type of eulogy that you can choose to write and present is shared memories , or personal reflections .shared memories or personal reflections or recollections .this is probably the easiest to write because you 're going to write the entire speech with no formal structure about your personal memories of this person .your experiences .and this is probably the one that you would choose if you had a close relationship with this person , especially over an extended period of time .you 're going to speak from your point of view about this person .you can talk about anything you want , but it 's your personal point of view .now , the trick is , it is the easiest to write , but it is the hardest to deliver , because there is an intense emotional connection because you 're talking about your personal experience with someone who is now deceased , who you probably miss a lot .but it 's a great choice .
in this example , what i 'm going to do is what they call speed picking or tremolo picking .and , basically , all that is is i 'm going to play on a single string .it 's going to go.

i 'm a singer song writer pianist living in west palm beach , florida and also new york city .in this clip we 're going to be talking about how to prepare your body physically for singing .the first thing you need to do is just stretch everything out .if i were standing i would actually do my back rolls , i would do a tip and roll from the back all the way down touch the floor .that kind of stuff .but sitting at the piano the easiest thing you can do is start with your shoulders .i would roll them backwards eight times , forwards eight times .you want to lift them up and relax them , and lift them up and relax them .do that some .the point is you want everything from here to here especially to be relaxed and stretched out , and energized .and this is the best way to do that .i would do some breathing exercises .in and out .in and out .i would roll , do head rolls like this .be careful when you go back not to crunch on top of the spinal column but to be thinking about a string pulling the top of your head at an angle around the circle .and even do your jaw .make sure you 're loose here .you can warm up your voice too while you 're doing this .ahh , that kind of thing .sometimes i will even massage the mask here because when you sing you want to feel the vibrations through out all of this part of your face .now if you 're going to be playing the piano accompanying yourself while you sing obviously.
hi my name is lauren with makeup by dodge and today we will be discussing how to make your cheekbones look higher .so when you look at your cheekbones you are going to see that there is a natural , there is the apple of your cheek and then there 's the plain of your cheek just right under your eye socket .this will be followed by a hollow which you will use a shadow to pull just right underneath your cheekbone .this is a little dark so you can lighten it up with a little of your medium color and then also before we apply the highlight on top of the cheekbone if you put a little shadow just right above the cheekbone.

so for our next step we are going to do is shampooing and conditioning the hair .shampooing and conditioning the hair is very very important cause the elements in the air , i mean we all know what is going on with the environment right now .it effects the hair .it really does so what you are going to want to do is get a very good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner and what we are going to do is shampoo .we are going to start at the scalp getting all the debris off the scalp and moving it through your ends .you are going to rinse that shampoo out , rinse it out very thoroughly .go back in with a moisturizing conditioner .i recommend using the conditioner mainly on the ends .do n't do it on the roots too much cause it is going to weight the hair down.
let 's talk about how to choose a football .sound simple ?it 's really a little bit more difficult .for the young guys that are playing pee-wee or pop warner , that kind of thing , the size of the football is determined by the league .more specifically , the age and the weight of the kid .contact the league , and find out which size football you should be using .for high school kids , all the high school footballs are all exactly alike .for the college kids , all the college footballs are exactly alike .now , depending on your position , if you 're a center , right , you want to become familiar with the laces , because that is your whole world .same thing as a quarterback .the width of the football is specific to the age that you 're playing .again , little league , pop warner , has a specific width and length .high school has a specific width and length , college has a specific width and length .the only personal choice that i would say when it comes into choosing a football , in terms of name brand , is when you go to the store , you touch and feel five or six of them , in the specific category that your age dictates , and you find the one that feels good in your hands .if you play receiver , quarterback , running back , defensive back , you get a ball , and you keep it with you .you take it to bed , you sleep with it , you carry it to school , you do your homework with it in your sight .you have your football with you at all times .
in this clip , we 're going to be working on taking off the back tail end of the bike , so we can go ahead and get to that exhaust .we 're going to start first by taking our allen wrench bolts off .that 's going to be right here .go ahead and use your five millimeter allen wrench.

just go over to a mirror , take a look in it .whatever you happen to be wearing right there , i 'd say just put on some good skateboarding shoes and you 're good to go .if you want to help support your local skate shop and support the skateboard companies , we have a vast array of demographics that you can choose from in your favorite brands .and , that 's another way that you can dress like a skateboarder .but really , it 's ...it does n't matter nowadays .there 's not one set demographic .anybody can skateboard .it does n't make a difference what you 're actually wearing on your body .you know .you can just put on your comfortable clothes , and skate shoes are the only thing that i truly recommend you have , 'cause they 're flat soled and grip the board good .and other shoes do n't really work well .so , yeah , that 's how to dress like a skateboarder .
in this clip , we 're going to talk about the proper way to change your oil in your rear differential .in this clip , we 're going to talk about fluid capacities , types of differential fluid and the appropriate way to fill up your axle after your oil change .what i have here is the typical cheap stuff right off the shelf .this is sae 80w-90 weight .that is the viscosity weight of it right there .my vehicle calls for a 90 weight , just do to where i live at in michigan , i got the 80w-90 .depending on your specific axle , the gear oil will vary widely .most new body styles dodge trucks , takes a 75w-140 .what you 're going to make sure is that you refer to your owner ?s manual and see the exact fluid required for your vehicle and the fill capacity .i picked up one of these at the parts store today .this is a filling tube .as you can see , you do n't have a lot of room to work on up here.
alright , in this clip we 'll be moving on to the arms .which are also tricky .you want to make sure you know exactly what you 're doing and what your proportions are going to be before you go in and actually draw the arms because it can literally either make or break your picture .so , first what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to give myself a marker.
first of all , we take white sauce .now white sauce is prepared out of butter , flour and milk .now we add cabbage and carrot to it and then pepper and some salt .now mix this well and then take a slice of bread .spread this mixture all over the slice and then place another slice of bread on this .and then , place it on the toaster and leave it for three to four minutes .so now , after four minutes , your toast is ready .so let 's see .now we take this toast , since it 's properly toasted , place it on a plate.
did you know leeks are one of the most cold tolerant of all the vegetables ?they can withstand temperatures down to about five degrees fahrenheit without dying .hi .i 'm jarrett from stone soup farm .and this is how to grow leeks .leeks are best planted in the spring , as soon as you can work the soil .they can survive through the spring frosts , even those little seedlings .and so , as soon as you can get in there , you can plant leek seeds .i like to do about three or four per clump .and the clumps are about a foot apart from each other , in rows that are about 18 inches from each other .it 's best to have well-drained soil with lots of compost or manure incorporated in beforehand .keep them well-watered and weed free throughout the season for the best yields .there is no such thing as too late to harvest leeks .they pretty much will last in the field all summer .as soon as they 're as big as you 'd like them to be , you can harvest then eat them , or you can leave them .they last quite well into the fall and even into the winter , you can come out and harvest .when you 're ready to eat them , you just grab and rip it out of the ground .it 'll have a few gross leaves on the outside , which you can pull off .and underneath , you 've got a lovely leek .like i said though , they do n't store quite as well once they 're harvested , but you can harvest them any time of year .so just leave them in the ground , and get them when you 're ready .i 'm jarrett from stone soup farm .and that 's how to grow leeks .
now we 're going to talk about a shuffle .shuffle is one of the most basic components of a tap step .it makes two sounds , first you start in the back , kick front , and then pull back using the flat part of your tap .you can also do a shuffle faster , you just need to loosen up your ankle , so pull front , back , front , back .you can also do a shuffle to the front , side , or to the back .now i 'm going to do the shuffle to the left side .starting slow , brush front , back .to the side , you 'd go front , back .to the back you 're going to kick more to the side .and then faster .
again you want to do this in small , circular motions , very cold , hold your breath .this is like getting in the pool for the first time where the waist line is the coldest .we naturally tan a little darker in our tummy area.

and i manipulate that back and forth by chipping small flakes off into fatter areas that i can take off bigger flakes .i got one problem on this rock right here , and there 's a divot right here .that 's called a hinge fracture .if i were to hit right here again , try to take off a flake this way , it would dive in there , hit that wall and break off again.
now that my loop is all lined up , now i can actually format and arrange the loops that i have right now .usually i 'll break down my drums a little bit even more .i 'll do snare by itself and every little sound , but for learning purposes , i grouped a bunch of them together .with this , my bars are already linked up.
