\begin{abstract}
The overflow of video content in the Internet (from YouTube, MOOCs, news portals) necessitates automated summarizations of data. In our paper, we study extractive and abstractive summarization for of instructional videos. Previously, natural language processing efforts have been focused to meticulously curated datasets far removed from textual inconsistencies that are inherent to videos. Our work on text preprocessing allows to extend the approach summarization of auto-generated amateur video transcripts. Next, we apply state-of-the-art pretrained BERT transformer models to the problem and evaluate the efficiency of  training and fine tuning with datasets from WikiHow, How2 videos, and CNN. The results are evaluated using ROUGE, Content F1, and blind assessments by human experts.

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
 

According to Forbes, more than 500 million hours of videos are watched on YouTube every day and a lot of time is wasted watching videos that are not useful. Video content is rapidly growing and will remain the mainstream for sharing information in future. In this project YAVA (“Your Active Virtual Audience”) we are aspiring to make online exchanges of information between people via audio or video more efficient and enjoyable. 

There have been a lot of research efforts recently focused on video summarization [e.g. see [Cai et.al.], [Shemer et.al.], [Kaufman et.al.]. The known methods work by extracting the most important segments and concatenating them together. However, it has been demonstrated that a lot of the time the result is not substantially better and sometimes even worse than random selection of video fragments ([Mayu et.al.]). 

Summarization in the area of multimodal video processing tackles the problem from a different angle. Instead of producing summary by converting a long video into a short video, it extracts signals from it speech-to-text, facial expressions, spectrogram of speaker’s voice; etc. (see [Samanth et.al.]). and processes them separately produces a short text (an abstract of what it is about). This method has a few advantages:

\begin{itemize}

\item We get access to a set of existing models for text summarization, substantially more mature than those for videos (e.g. [Subramanian et.al.]).
\item We can leverage existing text summarization datasets, which are more easily available, than video datasets (e.g. [Mahnaz et.al.]).
\item  Processing texts during algorithm training takes less computational power than processing videos.
\item  Arguably, a text summary of a long video is even better for the viewer than a short video, especially from the perspective of a person who needs it to decide whether to watch the full video.  It doesn’t consume the network bandwidth, doesn’t require audio equipment or noise-free environment, takes less device energy to reproduce (especially important for mobile devices) , and the viewer can consume it at their own pace.  You can skim the text in any order, any time. 

\end{itemize}


The models for these purposes have been developed better than for processing video as a whole (e.g. see [Jaejin et.al.]), and that’s why this approach referred to as “multimodal” summarization looks very promising to us and has recently received a lot of attention from other researchers (e.g. see [Palaskar et.al.], [Tripathi et.al.]) . 

The focus of our research is on how-to/instructions videos. According to \url{https://mediakix.com/blog/most-popular-youtube-videos/}, this type of video is one of the most popular on youtube these days.  Also, viewers of such videos are interested in getting a tangible outcome, as compared to viewers of entertainment or sports videos, therefore adding a summary will add more value. which we will use for training purposes. Pioneering efforts in this area have been done by [Palaskar et.al.] based on dataset of how2 videos [Sanabria et.al.]. We plan to improve on their results by taking advantage of “WikiHow: A Large Scale Text Summarization Dataset” [Mahnaz et.al.], improving the models, and applying more advanced techniques to evaluation of output.
Why is it important / challenging?
We foresee many applications of this approach, especially in education and business, where even minor improvements in information processing may make big differences when applied at scale to online meetings, virtual classrooms and other forms of human interactions via video. 

Summarizing content is challenging even for a human. The rules of identifying what’s important and what can be omitted are subjective, changeable and very hard to formalize. While watching a long video conference, participants often get tired and lose attention. Finally, a lot depends on the context. Yet, as hard as it is, most people get it, and this skill improves through a lot of learning and practice. It gives us hope that training machines to help facilitate this process is both possible and useful. 

From the initial exploration and data analysis we saw that in the process of applying the models of summarization to videos  we will deal with challenges imposed by parsing speech-to-text output add more complexity to text summarization (e.g. errors in word recognition, lack of punctuation in closed captioning, etc.). For example, in one of the sample videos in our test data set closed captioning confuses the speaker’s words “how you get a text from a YouTube video” for  “how you get attacks from a YouTube video”.

Also, evaluating the quality of summaries and obtaining benchmarks is another problem. As shown in research [Mayu et.al.], engaging human experts for evaluation of results is expensive, while automated techniques lack depth. We will use a combination of both techniques to maximize the quality of results. 

In our work, we are exploring transferability of modern text summarization techniques to  instructional videos scripts on large annotated data sets that we created by preprocessing YouTube videos and  data from other authors. We discuss heuristics that were discovered on this data, impacts on the quality of generated summaries, and propose different ways of improving summarization process to deal with these issues. Finally, we identify promising directions for future research.

\section{Prior work}

\subsection{Text Summarization}

Text summarization is the task of generating shorter versions of documents while maintaining important information [need link]. This area of research in the natural language processing community has grown rapidly over the past several years due to its practical applications among various industries such as news, reviews, education. Summarization systems take two general approaches: extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization provides users with textual summaries that have been copied and concatenated from important parts of a document. It is a reliable task capable of maintaining sentence structure and factual correctness. Abstract summarization generates a summary with content that is not always found in the underlying text. It is a complex task that mimics human summarization by generalizing and paraphrasing key points made in the document. 
Prior to 2014, summarization was centered on extracting lines from single documents using statistical models and neural networks had limited success[6, 7]. Sutskever et al. and Cho et al work on sequence to sequence models opened up new possibilities for neural networks in natural language processing. From 2014 to 2015, LSTMs (variety of RNN) became the dominant approach that achieved state of the art results. They became successful in tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, parsing, image captioning, etc. It paved the way for abstractive summarization, which began to score competitively against extractive summarization. In 2017, Attention is all you need [8] provided a solution to the ‘fixed length vector’ problem, enabling neural networks to focus on important parts of the input for prediction tasks. Transformers with attention became more dominant for certain tasks [9].

\subsection{Multi-modal Summarization}
Research surrounding multimedia has improved greatly to bridge the gaps between multi-modal 
content such as speech, visuals, and text. Summarization has been used in meeting records [10], sports videos [11], news [12], each encapsulating synchronized speech, videos, and subtitles. Video summaries consist of cutting important frames out of the video to create a succinct compact version. More recently, research around multimodal summarization, which combines the textual and visual modalities to align with the video content, have reached an early benchmark [13 - shruti’s work]. The How2Dataset [14] is a  collection of 2,000 hours of instructional videos with English subtitles and crowdsourced Portuguese translations. It covers different how-to domains such as sports, cooking, and education. The dataset has been created to be used as a benchmark for multimodal natural language tasks, used in various competitions and research settings. This How2Dataset precedes more recent work constructing data from instructional web videos in the How2100M [15] dataset. The dataset is large-scale and has 136 million video clips and transcripts of humans performing or describing various tasks, but there are no human annotated summaries. 

\section{Problem Statement}

In our work we set the following goals:
\begin{itemize}

\item Curate and publish a single source of truth data set of text and summaries aggregated and formatted from WikiHow articles, How2 videos, and CNN stories
\item Apply existing BERT-based text summarization models to make them applicable to auto-generated scripts from instructional videos and generalize them to worj on instructional videos
\item Augment ROUGE metrics [Chin-Yew Lin] for evaluation of the results with a framework for formalized expert assessment based on our research and criteria proposed by previous works 
\end{itemize}
 

\subsection{Retrieval of style files}

The style files for NeurIPS and other conference information are available on
the World Wide Web at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://www.neurips.cc/}
\end{center}
The file \verb+neurips_2020.pdf+ contains these instructions and illustrates the
various formatting requirements your NeurIPS paper must satisfy.

The only supported style file for NeurIPS 2020 is \verb+neurips_2020.sty+,
rewritten for \LaTeXe{}.  \textbf{Previous style files for \LaTeX{} 2.09,
  Microsoft Word, and RTF are no longer supported!}

The \LaTeX{} style file contains three optional arguments: \verb+final+, which
creates a camera-ready copy, \verb+preprint+, which creates a preprint for
submission to, e.g., arXiv, and \verb+nonatbib+, which will not load the
\verb+natbib+ package for you in case of package clash.

\paragraph{Preprint option}
If you wish to post a preprint of your work online, e.g., on arXiv, using the
NeurIPS style, please use the \verb+preprint+ option. This will create a
nonanonymized version of your work with the text ``Preprint. Work in progress.''
in the footer. This version may be distributed as you see fit. Please \textbf{do
  not} use the \verb+final+ option, which should \textbf{only} be used for
papers accepted to NeurIPS.

At submission time, please omit the \verb+final+ and \verb+preprint+
options. This will anonymize your submission and add line numbers to aid
review. Please do \emph{not} refer to these line numbers in your paper as they
will be removed during generation of camera-ready copies.

The file \verb+neurips_2020.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing your
paper. All you have to do is replace the author, title, abstract, and text of
the paper with your own.

The formatting instructions contained in these style files are summarized in
Sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and \ref{others} below.

\section{General formatting instructions}
\label{gen_inst}

The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas) wide and
9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch (9~picas).  Use 10~point
type with a vertical spacing (leading) of 11~points.  Times New Roman is the
preferred typeface throughout, and will be selected for you by default.
Paragraphs are separated by \nicefrac{1}{2}~line space (5.5 points), with no
indentation.

The paper title should be 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold, centered
between two horizontal rules. The top rule should be 4~points thick and the
bottom rule should be 1~point thick. Allow \nicefrac{1}{4}~inch space above and
below the title to rules. All pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the
top of the page.

For the final version, authors' names are set in boldface, and each name is
centered above the corresponding address. The lead author's name is to be listed
first (left-most), and the co-authors' names (if different address) are set to
follow. If there is only one co-author, list both author and co-author side by
side.

Please pay special attention to the instructions in Section \ref{others}
regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.

\section{Headings: first level}
\label{headings}

All headings should be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns),
flush left, and bold.

First-level headings should be in 12-point type.

\subsection{Headings: second level}

Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\subsubsection{Headings: third level}

Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\paragraph{Paragraphs}

There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the heading in
bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the heading followed by 1\,em
of space.

\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
\label{others}

These instructions apply to everyone.

\subsection{Citations within the text}

The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.  Citations may be
author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain internal consistency.  As to the
format of the references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is
used consistently.

The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
\end{center}
Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations appropriate for
use in inline text.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
   \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
\end{verbatim}
produces
\begin{quote}
  Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
\end{quote}

If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may add the
following before loading the \verb+neurips_2020+ package:
\begin{verbatim}
   \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
\end{verbatim}

If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add the optional
argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[nonatbib]{neurips_2020}
\end{verbatim}

As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the third
person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et al.\ [4],'' not ``In our
previous work [4].'' If you cite your other papers that are not widely available
(e.g., a journal paper under review), use anonymous author names in the
citation, e.g., an author of the form ``A.\ Anonymous.''

\subsection{Footnotes}

Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote, indicate
footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote.} in the
text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches (12~picas).

Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
marks.\footnote{As in this example.}

\subsection{Figures}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Sample figure caption.}
\end{figure}

All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark enough for
purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption always appear after the
figure. Place one line space before the figure caption and one line space after
the figure. The figure caption should be lower case (except for first word and
proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.

You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure captions and the
paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in either black/white or in
color.

\subsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table number and
title always appear before the table.  See Table~\ref{sample-table}.

Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
numbered consecutively.

Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical rules.} We
strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package, which allows for
typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
\begin{center}
  \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
\end{center}
This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Sample table title}
  \label{sample-table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
    \cmidrule(r){1-2}
    Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
    \midrule
    Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
    Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
    Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Final instructions}

Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.  In
particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text should
fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
\textbf{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
numbered.

\section{Preparing PDF files}

Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and not, for
example, ``A4.''

Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file must only
contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few instructions to
achieve this.

\begin{itemize}

\item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.

\item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader, select the
  menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can
  also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes with \verb+xpdf+ and is
  available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.

\item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose fonts are also
  acceptable for NeurIPS. Please see
  \url{http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf}

\item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap fonts.  Use
  "solid" shapes instead.

\item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You should use
  the equivalent AMS Fonts:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage{amsfonts}
\end{verbatim}
followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or \verb+\mathbb{C}+
for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You can also use the following
workaround for reals, natural and complex:
\begin{verbatim}
   \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
   \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
   \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
\end{verbatim}
Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the \verb+amssymb+ package.

\end{itemize}

If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we will ask
you to fix it.

\subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}

Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
\verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always specify the
figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
(\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})

A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly hyphenate a
line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command when
necessary.


\section*{Broader Impact}

The contribution of our research is three-fold:
\begin{itemize}

\item We created and published a data set of how-to videos with time-tagged scripts, machine-generated summaries
\item We generalized  existing text summarization models to the scripts extracted from the videos [Sanabria et.al.]
\item We augmented ROUGE metrics [Chin-Yew Lin] for evaluation of the results with a framework for formalized expert assessment based on our research and criteria proposed by previous works 
\end{itemize}

At a high level, we hope that our analysis of transferability of summarization techniques from text to videos will have both practical and theoretical impacts by helping identify promising directions for future research.
