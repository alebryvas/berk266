with all the dogs my wife and i have had over the years , there 's not been a single one who actually made an attempt to do the classic move of " burying a bone " . the only place we ever came close to seeing it was watching cartoons growing up . well ... . that was until reuben came along . he 's never dug a single hole outside , but he insists on taking his super special bone ( that he does n't chew on anymore ) and burying it in his dog bed for safe keeping . he will grab it and show it to people when they come in the house as if to say to them , " i present you with my riches in honor of your visit ! " . it 's then returned to the safety of his hiding spot under his bed cushion . watching him try and push imaginary dirt over it cracks us up every time .

chef deborah schneider , author of ¡ baja ! cooking on the edge , says that dried chiles need to be toasted before using them in recipes like her ancho chile salsa .<q>======================chow.com =========================<q>chow tips are the shared wisdom of our community . if you 've figured out some piece of food , drink , or cooking wisdom that the world has to know about , send us a message and tell us what you 've got in mind !<q>see all the newest uploads from chow with the latest videos playlist : http://bit.ly/owlvno<q>subscribe to chow : http://bit.ly/xtzxyj<q>for more recipes , stories and videos , check out http://www.chow.com/videos<q>chow on twitter : http://twitter.com/#!/chow<q>chow on facebook : http://www.facebook.com/chow<q>========================================================<q>transcript<q>all chiles need to be toasted before you can use them . it develops the flavors and dries them out a little bit . so the pepper goes right into the pan and you 'll see that the color 's immediately going to start to change and the pepper might even start to blow up a little bit like a balloon . what you do n't want to do is burn it . if they blacken they get really bitter . take them out . remove the stems and the seeds and then tear them up . the reason you tear them up is that it makes it easier to combine them in whatever you 're cooking . so at this point i can saute them into a salsa or i can pulverize for use as a powder .

progesterone suppositories used during pregnancy<q>http://drthomaslodi.com<q>we help women by giving them progesterone suppositories so they can hold a pregnancy to term .<q>there are a lot of women who can become pregnant but then have a hard time holding the pregnancy to term and end up having spontaneous abortions . the leading cause of this is women not having enough progesterone .<q>we give women who are having a hard time holding their pregnancies progesterone suppositories that they insert before they go to sleep and this works really well . they are then able to carry pregnancies to term where they could n't before .<q>the reason why progesterone is so important when it comes to holding the pregnancy to term is because it is part of the growing of the fetus and maintaining that environment . if women have low progesterone , the pregnancy is not able to hang on .<q>progesterone suppositories are a very simple fix for holding pregnancies to term .<q>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plktjy73tu_18t9qpego8d_gdrx3zaltfy<q>https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucyu61175ai-xv-u4_vtge5a/videos
my son and i built this trap because we have had a raccoon visiting the yard . it was a fun project . we probably built it too wide ( 17 " ) . it would have been better to make it a little more narrow ( 12 " - 14 " max ) . most plans for this trap do n't recommend a cross beam on the trigger stick . the first night we put it out , we just put a can of dog food in the back of the trap . in the morning the can was out of the trap , the door was n't sprung , and the wiley raccoon got a free meal . the next step was to staple the food dish to the actual trigger . we put ham and marshmallows in peanut butter -- with the idea being that the animal would have to wrangle with it a bit more and would n't be able to make off with it , without springing the trigger . that resulted in us catching a stray cat .

today i am going to show you how to set up a simple enclosure to keep your vampire crabs happy so they do n't jump out and suck your blood !<q>for a small group of 3 to 6 crabs , a tank between 10 and 15 gallons works well . we are going to create an enclosure with approximately 50 % land and 50 % water so the crabs can live their amphibious lives however they so choose ; no judgments here .<q>i have here a 12 gallon seapora tank made with ultra-awesome high clarity glass and it is roughly 24 x 12 x 15 inches which will provide lots of room for both the terrestrial and aquatic sections .<q>to build the land up without it just sloshing over to the wet side of the aquarium , i am going to use a filter foam block and cut it to size so it fits snugly in the tank . the height of the block needs to be only a little bit taller than the height of the land you are creating for the terrestrial side , since it is going to act as a barrier to keep it in place while still allowing water to pass through .<q>once in place , the next step is to create a drainage layer so that your land does n't get soppy and turn into mud . hydro balls work really well for this and also provide a place for beneficial bacteria to grow and help with biological processes .<q>make sure to put enough hydro balls to achieve the same depth as the maximum water height you want in the enclosure so that the water does n't touch the substrate layer .<q>next some screen mesh over the balls will prevent your substrate from just falling through the balls .<q>and now lets get some fancy dirt in there ! reptisoil is ideal since it is soft enough for the crabs to excavate , has good drainage properties , and also works well for live plants which we may just want to put in there too * wink * .<q>now that the land is made , we want to create a comfortable and attractive transition from the water side to the land . for this you can use your choice of aquarium safe rocks or stone . this will also help to keep that foam block in place .<q>once the rock is in place it is time to add some sand to the aquatic side of the enclosure . sand is ideal since the crabs prefer this type of substrate .<q>to add even more surface area and give the enclosure some extra levels and barriers to help detour any territorial aggression , i am going to add driftwood ! not to mention it just plain looks great .<q>with the hardscape done , we can move on to plants ! you do n't have to use live plants , but it does make for an attractive enclosure and provides the added benefit of reducing nutrient buildup by using the crab 's waste to grow .<q>you can also added mosses , dry or live , to both the land and the watery part of the habitat . the crabs will often lay their eggs in moss when they are ready to hatch , so having moss available is ideal .<q>for a more rugged natural look , you can add leaf litter and some seed pods or cork bark bits as finishing touches !<q>water movement and heat are ideal , so adding a small heater to keep the temp between 70 and 80 degrees fahrenheit , and a small water pump or internal filter to keep that water a ' move 'n will make sure your vampires are comfy cozy .<q>*** disclaimer : the purpose and content of this video is to provide general information regarding the animals , the products and their applications as presented in the video . big al 's aquarium services , big al 's aquarium supercentres and its officers , directors , employees and agents disclaim all express or implied warranties , in any way , related to the products and their application as presented in this video , make no representation or warranty regarding the products and the application as presented in this video and shall not be liable for any direct or indirect losses or damages of any type , including but not limited to punitive damages , or from personal injury or death resulting from or in any manner related to the video , and the products in and contents of the video . the viewer expressly agrees that big al 's aquarium services and big al 's aquarium supercentres and its officers , directors , employees and agents shall not be liable for any damages or losses related to the products in and content of the video and hereby agrees to hold the foregoing harmless from any such losses or damages .

" and , in a grave and trembling voice , the teacher looked her in the eyes and said - " i do n't know . " that was it . this sent the whole class into hysterics . students were trying to escape . some kids were even throwing themselves against the windows , wanting to climb out , and chloe imagined the worst - guns , shooting , her own funeral . she imagined all the things she had n't yet done in her life . she thought about dying , about her last seconds on earth . would this be another school shooting ?<q>and suddenly , there was a knock on the door . everybody froze ! was it a shooter , gunmen , an attacker , a killer , the police , the swat team , the army ? it occurred to chloe that a school shooter probably would not knock before entering , and she thought that was kind of weird . and finally , the teacher must have thought the same thing because she got our from behind her desk and opened the door .<q>it was the teacher from the class next to theirs , and outside in the hall , everything was totally normal . their teacher asked - still shaken - " what 's happening ? is n't there a lockdown ?! " and the other teacher said " no , they were just working on the clocks . " and that was it , no lockdown , no shooter , no threat , no danger and even though chloe was of course relieved , it ultimately made her sad to think of what her world has come to - where schools are put into lockdowns and students are afraid for their lives in what is supposed to be a second home and safe place .<q>this kind of storytime is both one of those scary stories and awkwardly funny at the same time , right ? mr nightmare lockdown scary .<q>visit clearlychloe 's channel to see and hear more of her ! http://bit.ly/2psrbhv<q>links<q>website : http://www.storybooth.com<q>iphone app : http://apple.co/2aywf3t<q>instagram : @thestorybooth<q>twitter : @thestorybooth<q>https://www.instagram.com/thestorybooth<q>g + : https://plus.google.com/+storybooth/v ...<q>contact us<q>info@storybooth.com<q>about storybooth<q>storybooth is a digital platform that invites young people to record and submit their stories for a chance to have them animated and shared with the world . embarrassment , heartbreak , challenges or triumphs ; funny , sad , serious , or silly - we 're looking for all kinds of stories - they just need to be real .

brand new episode ! " 48 hours in greenland 2018 : inuits , icebergs and insane hikes "<q>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oisf6bakeis -- ~ --<q>travel to tajikistan probably is n't your first choice when thinking about a weekend away from dubai . my first reaction when we booked tajikistan was ... " what have we gotten ourselves into ... ? "<q>it is definitely a destination to consider , so let us convince you why we think tajikistan is the hidden gem of central asia .<q>between the unexpected language barrier , money issues ( see tips below ) , cleanliness of the streets , gorgeous landscapes and incredibly friendly people , we had our share of everything that makes a weekend trip like this so special .<q>so here goes , we 'll try to pack as many helpful tips below as possible so you can enjoy an incredible 48 hours of travel to tajikistan as well .<q>travel to tajikistan - questions & answers :<q>how to travel to tajikistan from dubai ?<q>the best way to travel to tajikistan from dubai is by plane . we took a very convenient flight with somon air from dxb to dushanbe , tajikistan . comfortable and efficient , the flight cost us aed 1,300 each ( $ 330 ) . somon air is the new national airline of tajikistan and while they remain a majority domestic airline , we were surprised at how clean , comfortable and easy the flight was . considering it was an airline we had never heard of before and our ticket confirmations were all in tajik , we were skeptical .<q>what is the weather like in tajikistan ?<q>we went to tajikistan in july , and the weather was absolutely beautiful , especially coming from oven-like dubai . think 25 degrees during the day , going down to 20 during the night . no humidity , and sun all day long !<q>if you are going to head up to the fann mountains , and you 'd be insane not to , bring a long sleeve shirt , especially if you go at night . the mountains were topped with snow , even in the middle of the summer .<q>what to do during 48 hours in tajikistan ?<q>1 - visit the world 's tallest flagpole<q>dushanbe is the capital of tajikistan , and while it 's small , it is very lively . the " tallest flag pole " is trip advisor 's number 1 attraction , but do n't be fooled , it 's worth going to see just to people watch ! while the flag and flag pole are interesting themselves it really is the amazingly beautiful setting of the park , the perfectly taken care of gardens , statues , lakes and people strolling that make it so fun to walk through . drinks and snacks are sold by multiple vendors and you wo n't need more than a couple bucks to enjoy an afternoon . if you are n't careful , you might get dragged into a tajik wedding celebration so bring you dancing shoes !<q>2 - trek to the seven lakes<q>hiking and trekking are very popular in tajikistan . although they are more suited to a longer stay , it is recommended to tackle the seven lakes trek - made up of seven lakes around the mountains , each one a different color . while a trek will take more time , getting up into the mountains even for a couple hours is an absolute must .<q>3 - explore the hissar fort<q>hissar fort is only 30 minutes away from dushanbe city centre , and is an absolute must do . the architecture is gorgeous and the history about it fascinating . we had no idea what to expect but were floored when we arrived to see such an incredible ancient fort , from the 1200 's , looking so beautiful and with such a well preserved setting . getting lost in the old fort and surrounding buildings is very interesting and there is even a watering hole from a natural spring and horseback riding for the kids .<q>4 - climb the fann mountains<q>the fann mountains are beautiful , and if you have the time we strongly recommend to get up there , if only to admire the view over the valley . if you are scared of heights like me ( anne ) , it 's a bit of a love/hate moment , but it 's worth it . stop on the way at one of the artisanal honey making stands along the road and taste organic tajik honey - honestly the best we 've ever tasted . bee careful of bee stings ( see what i did there ... )<q>5 - stroll through rudaki park<q>rudaki park ( named after the famous tajik poet ) is the central heart beat of dushanbe and left us quite speechless after getting lost in its seemingly endless sections .<q>6 - be a child at boghi poytakht<q>plan a trip to boghi poytakht park and the botanical garden , both located close to each other on the outskirts of dushanbe , which is already a small city . the botanical gardens are vast and relaxing to visit while boghi poytakht park is a bustling amusement park complete with roller coasters , a huge ferris wheel and is even connected to a gigantic water park - which we were gutted to run out of time to visit .<q>subscribe to our newsletter : https://whatdoesntsuck.com/newsletter<q>follow us on social media for regular updates on what does n't suck<q>facebook https://www.facebook.com/whatdoesntsuck<q>twitter https://twitter.com/whatdoesntsuck_<q>instagram https://instagram.com/whatdoesntsuck/<q>pinterest https://www.pinterest.com/whatdoesntsuck/

recipe , for a jar ( 350 ml ) we used :<q>- one third bentonite clay<q>- one third baking soda<q>- 3 tablespoons himalayan salt ( crushed )<q>- calcium carbonate , we used 30 tablets ( 1000 mg pp )<q>- 15 activated charcoal capsules ( 200 mg pp )<q>- peppermint essential oil 30 drops , or as per your taste<q>many regular toothpastes contain multiple ingredients which are not healthy for you , but actually damage your teeth and overall health , like glycerine and fluoride . especially fluoride , which is added to most dental care products even though research has never proven its benefit for teeth and gums , has huge and lasting detrimental effects on teeth and body , but also on the pineal gland . fluoride causes calcification of this gland , hardening and destroying it , while from a spiritual perspective it is this gland that is connected to the ajna chakra or third eye , the seat of our will and of our evolution from human to divine beings . third eye awakening is a first priority when you are looking for a happy , blissful , and spiritually powerful life . avoiding any use of fluoride is a first and very important step in third eye awakening , for other tips on natural ways to decalcify the pineal gland , watch our video ` detoxify third eye with herbs ' ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uulvkno5jto ) .<q>when it comes to the health of our teeth and gums , it is important to understand that our mouth is the beginning of our digestive tract , and a healthy digestion makes all the difference for the energy level , the happiness , balance , longevity and health we experience in our lives . so taking good care of our teeth and mouth is essential . bad dental care starts with bad nutrition . many products that people consume daily in the west , like soda 's for instance , pull minerals from our food and body as they move through our system . the lack of minerals in our food supply cause our body to pull these same minerals from places where they are stored in our body , such as bones and teeth . this is the basis for tooth decay - our teeth become corrosive and vulnerable to bacteria . best dental care therefore consists of a boost of these minerals , which the body can absorb directly from the mouth as we use best products which both clean and feed our teeth .<q>in this video we give you a recipe for toothpowder , which will make your teeth clean and your mouth fresh , which mill remineralise and strengthen them , preventing tooth decay and any other dental problems . we describe the ingredients , like bentonite clay and himalayan salt , and how they help in dental care . making your own tooth powder is really a great way of preventing toxins to be added to your system , of turning the demineralisation process around and getting back to great healthy , shiny , white and strong teeth and gums . hope you enjoy the video , feel inspired to make your own tooth powder and enjoy the product after doing so !<q>subscribe to our channel : http://bit.ly/amritashrayadevanatha<q>connect with us on other social media :<q>facebook : http://bit.ly/1st3umk<q>amritashraya<q>facebook : http://on.fb.me/1ohpz1u<q>instagram : http://bit.ly/1sfpe2b<q>devanatha<q>facebook : http://on.fb.me/1ivxjoe<q>instagram : http://bit.ly/1myyuop<q>twitter : http://bit.ly/1vsa5gb<q>links to paramahamsa nithyananda<q>youtube : http://bit.ly/1sfpkao<q>website : nithyananda.org<q>inner awakening : innerawakening.org

columbus , ohio -- researchers at ohio state university have developed new technology that allows the body to generate any type of cell to help heal injuries .<q>according to a university press release , the technique , called tissue nanotransfection or tnt , uses a fingernail-sized nanochip which is placed over a patient 's skin or tissue . a droplet containing genetic material is placed on top of the chip , and then zapped with an electrical current .<q>the dna is delivered through channels created by the current , and it reprograms skin cells to turn into specific cell types that can then be used in other parts of the body .<q>when tested on a mouse with a damaged leg , researchers found vascular cells converted from skin cells formed new blood vessels that allowed the leg to heal in two weeks .<q>the non-invasive technology was also able to generate nerve cells in the legs of brain-damaged mice . once the cells were harvested , they were injected into the brain to help with stroke recovery .<q>the nanochip also tested effectively in pigs and is expected to be approved for human trials within a year .<q>the team 's research has been published in the journal nature nanotechnology .<q>---------------------------------------- - ---------------------<q>go to https://www.patreon.com/tomonews and become a patron now<q>tomonews is now on patreon and we 've got some cool perks for our hardcore fans .<q>tomonews is your best source for real news . we cover the funniest , craziest and most talked-about stories on the internet . our tone is irreverent and unapologetic . if you 're laughing , we 're laughing . if you 're outraged , we 're outraged . we tell it like it is . and because we can animate stories , tomonews brings you news like you 've never seen before .<q>visit our official website for all the latest , uncensored videos : http://us.tomonews.com<q>check out our android app : http://bit.ly/1rddhcj<q>check out our ios app : http://bit.ly/1go3z1f<q>get top stories delivered to your inbox everyday : http://bit.ly/tomo-newsletter<q>see a story that should be animated ? tell us about it ! suggest a story here : http://bit.ly/suggest-tomonews<q>stay connected with us here :<q>facebook http://www.facebook.com/tomonewsus<q>twitter @tomonewsus http://www.twitter.com/tomonewsus<q>google + http://plus.google.com/+tomonewsus/<q>instagram @tomonewsus http://instagram.com/tomonewsus

this catheter video is on the conveen optima from coloplast . the award winning male external catheter for its unique features . it is available in 4 different sizes , each having two different styles . made of 100 % silicone it eliminates the chance of an allergic reaction to latex . there is the standard sheath length , and the sport sheath length . this refers to the amount of material that will be rolled onto the penis to create a leak proof seal . for someone that may experience a retraction on their penis it is advisable for them to use the sport sheath .<q>the amount of material that rolls on with the sport sheath is less than that of the standard . the standard has 4 " of roll and the sport 2 " . what this means is that there is less of a roll of material at the base . sometimes when retraction occurs and there is a left over roll of material at the base , the catheter will try to roll back up and come off . with less material to roll on the entire catheter is used , and this eliminates the roll . so when retraction does occur the catheter will stay in place and is less likely to come off .<q>another feature of the conveen optima is the pull tab that is on each catheter . this can make application much easier for those who have manual dexterity problems , or for caregivers who need to apply the catheter with gloves on . many times when a caregiver needs to apply a catheter and they are wearing gloves they find that the adhesive can make it very difficult to apply the catheter and not have it come in contact and stick to their gloves . with the pull tab the catheter is put in place at the head of the penis , keeping 1/4 " -3 / 4 " gap between the penis and the outlet tube . hold the catheter in place with one hand , while gripping the double strip pull tab with the other . pull the tab slowly unrolling the catheter towards the base of the penis . gently make a fist around the shaft for a few seconds to ensure a good proper seal . no additional adhesive is necessary . connect a drainage bag , or leg bag into the tip of the catheter pushing it in far enough that the sure grips securely keep the collection bag attached . anti kink bellows ensure that there is a continuous flow even when the cone is bent .<q>each male external catheter comes in its own recyclable smart pack . this makes carrying them , and disposing of them a much safer and hygienic way of caring for incontinence supplies . find the conveen optima male external catheter from coloplast at http://www.biorelief.com/product/conveen-optima-external-male-catheter-by-coloplast/

http://amzn.to/2dj8kjx - the aquarium gravel vs sand argument is a good one . this is my opinion on sand and why i do n't like it . you should add a sponge filter to every tank as added filtration and a backup filter incase your filter stops working . this is the best one i 've found . here is a link :<q>hydro sponge filter : http://amzn.to/2dj8kjx<q>favorite air pump : http://amzn.to/2elkiqs<q>questions and comments : please help !!! i have posted about this 3 times with very limited responses ! i do n't know what to do because i 've never had this problem . i think my betta has hole in head . i need help diagnosing and treating . water parameters are in a picture below . he had 3 african dwarf frogs and had 2 tetras with him in a 10 gallon but i removed the tetras in case they were nipping him . i really need help .<q>he is acting normal but i 've never seen them before and i take a lot of close up pictures of him . looking back on them , they are n't there . that and there was a scale hanging off his cheek yesterday evening that fell off before i could get a picture .<q>my betta looks very similar and has the same spots . he 's had them since i got him and he seems okay , i 've had him about 2 months .<q>everything i read has said they could be his sensory pores . i would say just watch to see if they get bigger , he starts to lose color and appetite .<q>as said , i would separate him from the frogs . there is a parasite desease with the same name " hole in the head " . if you notice that it progresses and travel down the lateral line , buy parasite clear , take off carbon if you have it in filter and use it . he looks totally fine to me . nitrates are kinda high , but livable . on a separate note , tetras are a schooling fish and are much happier in groups of five or more , and do best in larger aquariums .<q>it was cleaning day ! 7 $ tank found at goodwill almost 2 gallons rosie so happy in her clean room . cute storie when i got her she was the smallest little pale baby out of all of them . she did have a little purple stripe on her sides witch made her super unique . never thought she would grow this much ! she 's huge in my eyes now all grown up and love her colors . i have a snail that somehow got out of a closed tank and was all crispy but came back to life after about 5 minutes back in water . my cousin 's betta 's tank froze solid one winter and he defrosted and lived another 3 years .<q>not a betta but my husband was picking up a pearl gourami , it jumped and freaked out under the tanks at petsmart for like 10 mins before the employee could catch him . my husband was like " hell yeah i want him he 's got some spunk ! " he 's made a full recovery and is the most active fish in our 125 gallon community tank lol he 's skittish of nets and hands in the tank but does n't dare jump anymore .<q>related , i almost hit a deer the day i brought 3 bettas home and all of them went flying into the foot area of my car ... i managed to find them all on the floor with my bare hands and found half a bottle of water to split between the 3 cups . they all lived and are doing wonderfully , despite their rough start in life ! my petco is great as well it depends on the store my petco will actually quarantine their fish and treat them and when they do so they turn off the lights of the tank being treated and on a paper is the reason why they wo n't let anyone buy the fish either .<q>at my petco we clean the bettas 3 times weekly , and we are only required to do it two times weekly , and we also spot clean them in between cleaning days , and still sometimes we get the ones that float on their sides or get finrot . opinions on best clean up crew ? all my tanks either have an algae or slime mold problem . i have a mystery snail in one tank and it does n't do its job .<q>hello . this is my first time posting here but was wondering if i could get some advise . i 've had this betta a month . my first betta . this morning i noticed his back fins are damaged . could you tell me if this is fin rot or nipping and what i should do to help him ? thank you .<q>he is a dumbo halfmoon . no plastic plants in his tank . oooookay ! so ! we definitely left with the five gallon divided tank and two betta boys ! yay ! but . we 've just gotten home and the tank , which is plastic , is cracked !!! pet smart is closed now so it ca n't be returned until tomorrow . will the boys be ok in their cups for the night , or a jar of some sort ?<q>aquarium gravel vs sand
making a saddle stand really is n't that hard . i wish i could say i made this but i ca n't . a very good friend of mine who also loves horses built this for me ( thank you lynda !!!!! )<q>she built it using 1x12 " wood for the main frame of the stand , and then she used 1x3 " wood for the slats on the top where the saddle sits , as well as the feet which help to stabilize the saddle stand .<q>for the top of the stand , she used a bucket and traced the outer edge to make the round part . each end was cut to 36 " tall , and then she attached the bottom sides . these were made from 1 x 12 " wood , cut to 24 " long .<q>then she added shelf supports using 1 x 3 " wood , and then she cut another piece of the 12 " wood for the shelf .<q>then she cut 1x3 " wood into 24 " long pieces and starting from the top , she attached the slats , this is where the saddle sits . she then cut the feet , and used a jig saw to round the edges . the foot supports are 20 " long which helps to make the stand very sturdy , and stable .<q>so now that lynda did all of the hard work , all i had to do was stain the stand , and add some finishing touches like a bridle rack and a name plate to personalize it .<q>i have wanted to make a saddle stand for so long , but with all of the jumps that i build , and other projects i just never had the time to do it .<q>lynda just decided to see if she could do it , and guess what ? she did ! this is a perfect example to show you if you want something bad enough , you can figure it out !<q>do n't forget to subscribe to my channel for tons of how to horse project ideas ! this thing is just getting started , and trust me , you wo n't want to miss what i have in store for you !<q>https://www.youtube.com/channel/uclocgpjieouhupbz1iaw70w<q>thanks for watching !

shopping for a home chocolate fountain , but not sure where to start ? you 've heard the good , the bad and the ugly about home chocolate fountains , so we 've done some comparison shopping for you with well-known chocolate fountain brands . here 's what we found .<q>we gave each fountain a completely honest shot to perform at its ' highest and best level . we think you 'll find this helpful .<q>here are some things to look for . remember the old saying : " you get what you pay for " ! hmmm - they were right .<q>we purchased chocolate fountains from ` big box ' stores , local department stores and on the internet . we found , in general , each fountain was , sadly , poor quality . the performance promised did n't meet said expectations .<q>we had to pre-melt the chocolate , in all cases . none of the fondue fountains have a basin capable of melting the chocolate or any other type of fondue , directly in the basin . even though we poured our melted chocolate fondue into preheated basins , in most cases , the basin was not warm enough , nor did it stay warm enough to keep the chocolate fondue cascading properly over the tier-sets . chocolate gaps appeared frequently . not the pretty setting we picture .<q>assembly was awkward ; some of the fountains had welded tier-sets and because of this , level and stable fountains were a problem . as chocolate would rise to the top , the fountain became top-heavy and we almost had some chocolate fountains tipping over . later those welded tier-sets also became very difficult to clean .<q>most of the motors were very noisy and would be extremely disconcerting at a celebration or dinner party - guests having to raise their voices to be heard over the noise of the chocolate fountain motor . very distracting to say the least .<q>in general , here are 6 easy things to look for when purchasing a home chocolate fountain :<q>1 . whisper-quiet motor<q>2 . heated basin that actually will melt and maintain your fondue temperature<q>3 . quality construction<q>4 . leveling ability - adjustable feet to easily level fountain<q>5 . ease of assembly - quik set tiers are a thumbs up !<q>6 . easy to clean ( some parts being dish-washer safe )<q>sephra select : https://bit.ly/2agbzon<q>sephra classic : https://bit.ly/2ooh2vi<q>sephra elite : https://bit.ly/2jt621p<q>sephra belgian dark chocolate : https://bit.ly/2jrsvd5<q>sephra.com : https://bit.ly/2bhryar<q>facebook : https://bit.ly/2d7czuw<q>intstagram : https://bit.ly/2oxfx7t<q>pinterest : https://bit.ly/2p1aow4<q>#chocolatefountaincomparison #fonduefountain #bestchocolatefountain #chocolatefountain #homechocolatefountain #homefonduefountain #sephrafountain #sephrachocolate #fondueparty #fonduerecipes #chocolatefountainreview

this video was sponsored by best buy , however , all opinions are genuine .<q>in this episode of abbey 's kitchen abbey welcomes two special guests , abby langer 's daughters . they join her in the kitchen to make a special batch of gluten free sugar cookies with dairy free icing for their mom .<q>for this recipe a stand mixer is preferred , abbey happens to have a kitchenaid available , but any stand mixer would be fine . start off by combining your butter , your brown sugar , and your maple syrup . set your stand mixer to medium and let those ingredients mix together for just a bit . next you will add in your almond flour , which is a big part of what makes this recipe gluten free . after that pour in some vanilla extract followed by some almond extract , a pinch of salt , a pinch of cinnamon and then crack an egg into the mixing bowl as well . abby 's daughters both wanted the honor of cracking the egg so abbey played a clever game with them to see who got to do the cracking . once your egg is into the mixing bowl you are ready to make your dough . simply turn on the mixer and let it do its job until your ingredients reach a doughy consistency .<q>pull your mixing bowl off of the stand and reach right in there for your dough . in abbey 's case they made so much dough they decided to vacuum seal and freeze half of it . put flour down on your counter top to prevent your dough from sticking as you roll it out fairly flat . using your choice of cookie cutters cut out the shapes you want and put them onto a parchment paper lined baking pan . cook them at 350 ` f , just long enough to get slightly golden brown .<q>now , it 's time to make the icing . break your mixer back out and add a good amount of what appears to be confectioners ' sugar . refer to the video to get a better idea of exactly how much you should be adding . once your sugar is in add unsweetened vanilla almond milk and some almond extract . raise up your mixing bowl and mix these ingredients on slow . you are making icing so when the contents of the bowl start to look like icing it 's safe stop mixing . abbey splits her icing into three separate icing bags and adds a bit of food coloring to each . this is a great trick to bring some pizazz to your cookies . snip the tip off of your icing bags and decorate each cookie any way you feel compelled to do so with the icing . abby 's daughters also add gumdrops and some sort of candy sparkle to theirs for flair .<q>your cookie baking is done and your sugar cookies are now ready for mom . abbey decides it might be nice to print out some cards for the girls to give to their mom along with the cookies , which they do . celebrate this mother 's with something special for mom , even if it is n't these gluten free sugar cookies with dairy free icing .<q>for more tips on staying healthy , recipes , dieting , and information fit for consumption by foodies everywhere stop by abbeys blog .<q>http://www.abbeyskitchen.com/

slugs and snails are one of the most vicious orchid pests , they love to munch on new growth . new roots , new emerging pseudobulbs or leaves and even flowers and spikes can get decimated in a matter of days if a serious infestation is present . needless to say this can lead to an orchid 's death .<q>the good news is that there is a way to get rid of them for good . now i tried luring them out with lettuce , cucumber , beer , potato slices , you name it , but it did n't solve the infestation .<q>my preferred non toxic method is to use hydrogen peroxide 3 % which reacts with their soft skin and burns them . this is slightly cruel , so if you are not ok with this , do n't do it , the peroxide does n't just bother them , it kills them on the spot and i do n't think it 's a pretty site , so it is your choice .<q>ofcourse a repot of the orchid into fresh media is necessary , as the old media might hide baby snails or eggs which can get away from the peroxide . if you want to use the same pot and stake , then wash them very well with detergent and hot water .<q>use fresh media that was never used before with other orchids and try to clean the roots of the orchid of as much old media and debris as possible . this will limit the possible number of eggs or small snails that might be invisible .<q>as a preventive measure , never use the same water when watering orchids , especially if you have new orchids in your collection that might have a snail infestation . the snails only travel in moist environments , water is the best way to spread the infestation .<q>join our community and find tutorials , photos , care sheets and loads of goodies orchid nature - http://www.orchidnature.com<q>follow me on twitter https://twitter.com/missorchidgirl<q>follow me on instagram https://instagram.com/missorchidgirl<q>see what orchid lovers want to know http://bit.ly/1byjuw1<q>how to care for specific orchids http://bit.ly/1mxojso<q>easy orchid how to 's http://bit.ly/1byklzz<q>want some pictures ? http://bit.ly/mg3dc0

my husband made this video for our ( at the time ) 5 yr old son . he was dx with autism spectrum disorder back in 2011 . over a year ago , we tried to get him on his first ever airplane to fly for just a day trip to dallas . he walked down the jetbridge , heard the buzzing and high pitch noises and it scared him so badly he wanted nothing to do with getting on that plane and he ran back up the jetbridge and started crying . so that flight never happened . since then , i decided to make a homemade video after work one night ( i work for southwest airlines ) showing a walk thru in the gate area , down the jetbridge , and into the plane ( noises and all ! ) all while i did some explaining on everything i was capturing . well , my son loved it !! he has watched it over and over and over again . it made him get excited and want to get on a plane so yesterday ( august 6 , 2014 ) , we tried it again . i was blown away at the change in him ! he absolutely loved it !! he loved it so much , we added an extra flight to our itinerary just to have another flight ! i was so happy for him ! his progress with his ot has been monumental !<q>we hope you enjoy and show it to your child if they are having issues with flying . hopefully it will help them as much as it has helped our son !<q>edit ... . the first part of the video got cut off but what i said was we ended up flying on three flights that day not two ! it was an incredible day !

" penny looks confused and then agrees . sheldon says that she played her hand well and that he does n't give penny enough credit .

http://mortgagelocator.ca/<q>this video explains when an appraisal is , and is not , required on a home purchase in canada .<q>hey everybody , it 's rowan smith of the mortgage center . i 'm here today to talk about appraisals . there seems to be a lot of confusion as to when appraisals are ordered , when they 're not ordered .<q>this blog today is going to detail in what circumstances it 's going to be needed . it 's a little counter intuitive . you see there 's typically an appraisal or some assessment of value 100 percent of the time . does that mean that they go through the property and take pictures every single time ? no .<q>so , i 'm going to divide this into three categories , less than 20 percent down , 50 to 20 percent down and greater than 50 percent down . those are the three main categories . you can argue with me a little bit on this , but that 's the three general guidelines .<q>now , less than 20 percent down , the bank 's going to want to make sure they know the value of the property , but do they require an appraisal ? the typical answer is not usual . the reason being is less than 20 percent down are insured by either cmhc , genworth and canada guarantee . it 's mortgage insurance . that 's that big insurance premium you hear about .<q>now , in those circumstances those lenders typically , though not always , have a internal modeling software that looks at sales in the area and the last prices , listings , et cetera . and as long as you 're within a range of normalcy , not wildly above or below , they 're going to accept that value .<q>now , there 's times when even when you 've got the mortgage insurance , they still ask for appraisals . and that 's sometimes when there 's a rental component to the property or it 's particularly unique or a high-end home or for whatever reason that they do n't support the lending value of the home . so , that 's if there is less than 20 percent down , they typically do n't need appraisals . but , again , an assessment of value is always being done .<q>now , from 50 to 20 percent down , you will almost need an appraisal 100 percent of the time . now , some banks , a social bank , has an internal property assessment tool that they use , and they will do similar to those systems through the mortgage insurers .<q>they 'll do like an electronic appraisal , but they have some guidelines there . the property ca n't be more than a certain value and all those eligible for homes beyond a certain age , size or whatnot . usually , those electronic systems are only allowed in a major urban setting , whatnot .<q>so , most times 50 to 20 percent down payment , you 're going to require an appraisal . it costs about $ 250 to $ 300 , depending on where the property is located . this is assuming it 's a general , normal transaction .<q>the appraiser will go to the property , takes some photos and walk through it and then prepare a report of anywhere from 40 to 70 pages , depending on the complexity and depending on the lending requirements . it outlines everything about the property and makes an assessment of value , based on other comparable sales .<q>now , you may think to yourself . ok , well , if i 'm putting 20 percent down or more , why do they want an appraisal . when i put less than 20 percent down , they do n't want an appraisal . and the answer is that when you 're putting 20 percent or more that bank is absorbing the full risk of that mortgage .<q>if you default on it or the property values fall and you walk away , they eat the loss versus the mortgage insurers are the ones that take the loss in the event that you 're putting less than 20 percent down . so , the bank leaves it up to them because they ultimately will be the one at risk to make an assessment of value .<q>so , less than 20 percent down , probably not an appraisal but you may have to , depending on the property . 50 to 20 percent down in that range , you 're going to need an appraisal of some kind , whether it 's an electronic one or whether it 's a walk-through .<q>typically , it 's a walk-through . 50 percent or more down , we can often use tax assessed values because it is such a low amount of financing . it 's a very low risk to the lending institutions .<q>some banks unequivocally demand appraisals 100 percent of the time . other ones will use a property assessment tool if you have that much down the desktop or drive-by appraisals which are less costly and quicker to get . but it will still provide with some comfort .<q>those are the situations where an appraisal will be required . if you 're being asked for one and you do n't understand why , just give me a call . i 'll give you an explanation for it .<q>i 'm rowan smith from the mortgage center .

"<q>tone : are you depressing or upbeat & vibrant ? be sure you are on the end of upbeat & vibrant<q>enunciate : pronounce each word crystal clearly<q>volume : do n't talk too loudly or too quietly<q>after you say ` hello ' and introduce yourself , ask how you can help the caller ?<q>voice-mail message : make sure it 's solid and simple that gives you all the information and is professional<q>make sure your greeting and voice-mail are reflecting the image you want to project . make sure the way you want to be perceived is actually the way you are being perceived .

not all ticks transmit lyme disease , so it 's important to be familiar with what type of tick to look out for and symptoms to be aware of in the event that you or your child has been bitten by a tick . christina hermos , md , infectious disease physician at umass memorial children 's medical center , shares that deer ticks in the nymph stage are often the carriers of lyme disease and can be hard to spot , being as small as the size of a pencil tip . she explains that the likelihood of contracting lyme disease from a tick increases if the tick has been on the body from more than 24 to 48 hours . in this segment , dr. hermos offers tips on removing ticks , symptoms to keep an eye out for , and the different treatment options available to adults versus children .<q>www.umassmemorialhealthcare.org<q>looking for a great doctor ? call 855-umass-md<q>connect with us :<q>facebook : www.facebook.com/umassmemorial<q>twitter : @umassmemorial
http://www.nucleushealth.com/ - this 3d medical animation created by nucleus medical media shows the health risks of smoking tobacco .<q>id # : anh12071<q>transcript :<q>every time you smoke a cigarette , toxic gases pass into your lungs , then into your bloodstream , where they spread to every organ in your body . a cigarette is made using the tobacco leaf , which contains nicotine and a variety of other compounds . as the tobacco and compounds burn , they release thousands of dangerous chemicals , including over forty known to cause cancer . cigarette smoke contains the poisonous gases carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide , as well as trace amounts of cancer-causing radioactive particles . all forms of tobacco are dangerous , including cigars , pipes , and smokeless tobacco , such as chewing tobacco and snuff .<q>nicotine is an addictive chemical in tobacco . smoking causes death . people who smoke typically die at an earlier age than non-smokers . in fact , 1 of every 5 deaths in the united states is linked to cigarette smoking .<q>if you smoke , your risk for major health problems increases dramatically , including : heart disease , heart attack , stroke , lung cancer , and death from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .<q>smoking causes cardiovascular disease .<q>when nicotine flows through your adrenal glands , it stimulates the release of epinephrine , a hormone that raises your blood pressure . in addition , nicotine and carbon monoxide can damage the lining of the inner walls in your arteries . fatty deposits , called plaque , can build up at these injury sites and become large enough to narrow the arteries and severely reduce blood flow , resulting in a condition called atherosclerosis . in coronary artery disease , atherosclerosis narrows the arteries that supply the heart , which reduces the supply of oxygen to your heart muscle , increasing your risk for a heart attack . smoking also raises your risk for blood clots because it causes platelets in your blood to clump together . smoking increases your risk for peripheral vascular disease , in which atherosclerotic plaques block the large arteries in your arms and legs . smoking can also cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm , which is a swelling or weakening of your aorta where it runs through your abdomen .<q>smoking damages two main parts of your lungs : your airways , also called bronchial tubes , and small air sacs called alveoli . cigarette smoke irritates the lining of your bronchial tubes , causing them to swell and make mucus . cigarette smoke also slows the movement of your cilia , causing some of the smoke and mucus to stay in your lungs . while you are sleeping , some of the cilia recover and start pushing more pollutants and mucus out of your lungs . when you wake up , your body attempts to expel this material by coughing repeatedly , a condition known as smoker 's cough . over time , chronic bronchitis develops as your cilia stop working , your airways become clogged with scars and mucus , and breathing becomes difficult .<q>your lungs are now more vulnerable to further disease . cigarette smoke also damages your alveoli , making it harder for oxygen and carbon dioxide to exchange with your blood . over time , so little oxygen can reach your blood that you may develop emphysema , a condition in which you must gasp for every breath and wear an oxygen tube under your nose in order to breathe .<q>chronic bronchitis and emphysema are collectively called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , or copd . copd is a gradual loss of the ability to breathe for which there is no cure .<q>cigarette smoke contains at least 40 cancer-causing substances , called carcinogens , including cyanide , formaldehyde , benzene , and ammonia . in your body , healthy cells grow , make new cells , then die . genetic material inside each cell , called dna , directs this process . if you smoke , toxic chemicals can damage the dna in your healthy cells . as a result , your damaged cells create new unhealthy cells , which grow out of control and may spread to other parts of your body . cigarettes can cause cancer in other parts of your body , such as : in the blood and bone marrow , mouth , larynx , throat , esophagus , stomach , pancreas , kidney , bladder , uterus , and cervix .<q>smoking can cause infertility in both men and women . if a woman is pregnant and smokes during pregnancy , she exposes her baby to the cigarette 's poisonous chemicals , causing a greater risk of : low birth weight , miscarriage , preterm delivery , stillbirth , infant death , and sudden infant death syndrome . smoking is also dangerous if a mother is breastfeeding . nicotine passes to the baby through breast milk , and can cause restlessness , rapid heartbeat , vomiting , interrupted sleep , or diarrhea .<q>other health effects of smoking include : low bone density and increased risk for hip fracture among women ; gum disease , often leading to tooth loss and surgery ; immune system dysfunction and delayed wound healing ; and sexual impotence in men .

watch this video to learn about possible signs of sensory integration issues . this video shows an expert panel of health professionals , susanne smith roley , clare giuffrida , stefanie bodison , and shay mcatee discussing how sensory integration or sensory processing affects children and the real-life stories of parents of children with sensory issues . for more information , resources and videos about sensory motor issues and other topics please visit http://www.pathways.org or call 1 800 955child<q>download accompanying handout : http://pathways.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/doesmychildsensoryissue_english.pdf<q>all materials including videos are provided at no cost ; no fees or charges may be associated with any of the pathways.org materials without prior written approval .<q>for some children , their senses may not be sending the information to the brain correctly . their behavior can look under or over reactive . they may seem fearful or disorganized . they may have problems reaching physical milestones , socializing or learning .<q>if this sounds like your child he or she may have a sensory issue<q>there 's an explosion in the number of children who have sensory differences affecting their learning behavior . the earlier you can get help for these issues , the better everybody is . it does not make sense to wait and the research is very clear on this , that they 'll grow out of it is a fallacy . we usually think of 5 senses : sight , sound , touch , smell , taste but there are actually 2 more senses that are very important . one of them is the sense that tells us about our body position . if you put your hand behind your back and spread your fingers apart you would know that your hand is in that position because of the information from your muscles and joints . this sense is called proprioception . and we have another sense that gives us information about movement . it helps us to move in a smooth coordinated way . to maintain our balance and to adjust our eyes while we are moving . this is called the vestibular sense . we 're all constantly taking in sensory information and using that sensory information that we 're getting from the world around us . and some of us might be better in some areas than others like some people might have really good hearing or better vision while other people might have better body position sense or movement sense but we 're all pretty much able to hopefully be functional . and that 's what we 're looking for the children we 're treating . sometimes it 's hard to tell what a sensory issue looks like because no two children with a sensory issue act exactly the same way . parents are typically the first to notice that their child might be doing things differently .<q>every day , our brains effortlessly take in millions of pieces of information from the outside world to help us learn , play and work<q>for most of us , these messages enter the body through our senses , and speed like a fast train to the right places in the brain to help us react<q>for some children these messages do n't have a smooth trip . the train gets stuck , follows the wrong signals , or moves slowly along the tracks<q>there are times when others are interpreting these behaviors as being malicious . often they 're accused of purposefully breaking toys or being too aggressive , and not being invited on play dates or to birthday parties or even wanting to interact on the playground<q>you can have a child that is very sensitive to say auditory or sounds . and it might look to people around them that they 're not really paying attention . when actually what they are doing is that they are paying attention too much<q>it was more frustrating , definitely , before we knew , because then we were like , why is he behaving like that , and why is he , you know , why is he acting up like that ?<q>he did n't like the unexpectedness of being splashed , really stayed away from sprinklers , swimming pools . taking a shower was just something that we could n't even think about doing for him<q>one of the ways i describe sensory difficulties to parents is by talking about getting glasses . you know because everybody goes to an optometrist for an eye check and if you do n't see 20/20 the optometrist will give you glasses . and that 's a wonderful way to uh change your visual perception you know the way you see . um , but we do n't have glasses for the other senses . that 's were sensory integration intervention comes in because we try to provide activities that will enhance the way the child perceives those kind of sensory inputs<q>watch this video to learn possible signs of sensory integration issues .

http://www.drenergysaver.com | 1-888-225-6260<q>for many decades , the material of choice to insulate homes has been fiberglass . blown fiberglass is used for the attic whereas fiberglass batts are used for wall cavities , ceilings , and pretty much everything else . today , it is still a very popular insulation material , and is still used in new construction -- it is inexpensive and most builders and insulation contractors are used to it .<q>yet , there are several insulation materials available today that far outperform fiberglass insulation in many levels , and in the # 61 episode of on the job larry janesky , owner and founder of dr. energy saver , will show us how spray foam insulation outperforms fiberglass batts when it comes to wall cavity insulation in new construction .<q>larry begins by reminding us that modern houses are n't built as rectangles with gabled roofs anymore . most new homes have architectural features such as cantilevers , multi level areas , enclosures and fixtures that create irregular wall cavities and many challenges in terms of insulation .<q>the house showcased in this video is one example of this type of modern construction .<q>fiberglass has an r-value of 3 per inch while spray foam has a r - value of 7 per inch . r-value is a measure of resistance to heat flow , and a lower r-value per inch means that you need a thicker layer of fiberglass than you would of spray foam to insulate the same area and achieve the same ideal r-value .<q>the problem is that the fiberglass r-value is rated only when the material is fully fluffed , not when it is compressed and touching all the surfaces in the cavity , without edge gaps . a small 4 % edge gap will cause a 30 % decrease in the r-value of fiberglass insulation .<q>add to that the fact that fiberglass has no air sealing capabilities , and air flows right through the material and you will begin to understand how it can be easily outperformed by other insulation materials , especially spray foam insulation .<q>larry walks us through the many architectural and framing features of the building that would create several opportunities for insulation failure if fiberglass were the chosen material -- and he shows us just how easily closed spray foam can be applied to the exact same problem areas . spray foam insulation expands and effectively fills even the smallest spaces and gaps , leaving no holes in the insulation blanket and air seals the walls as well !<q>at dr. energy saver , we are always looking for ways to make homes more comfortable and reduce the cost of homeownership by improving energy performance . if you would like to make your home more comfortable , visit our website to locate a dealer in your area .<q>watch our other on the job videos for more information on energy saving home improvements and subscribe to our youtube channel to get the latest updates !

bead break extremely stuck tires .<q>this tire was really stuck on the rim and was very difficult to remove . i got this tire used a couple years ago and it was installed at a junk yard . it looks like it had a bead of weatherstrip adhesive along the rim . the other side was even worse to break the tire loose from the rim . i had the tire bead all the way down several inches and the tire was still stuck on the rim . there was glue holding it on . if you have a rime that can not clean up good and it has a rough surface where the bead of the tire mounts the product to use is a special tire bead sealer . you do n't ever want to use any kind o adhesive . a tire bead sealer will actually make the tire easier to dismount because it will stop the inside of the rim from rusting or corroding . rust can sometimes make a tire hard to dismount but glue definitely will make it next to impossible to dismount the tire and break loose the bead on the tire .

here is a fun idea i used as a bridal shower/wedding gift . i used the towels the bride registered for and included other bathroom goodies like soap , back scrubbers and luffa sponges . i used shimmer white , cream and shades of brown tissue paper on the outer edge of the basket to tie in the colors of the soaps i added . my favorite thing about this gift that i feel makes it unique , is that it 's in a square laundry basket that will also be useful because we all have laundry ! you can shrink wrap it or add netting around it with a bow . it also makes a great house warming gift idea . use the same concept for a gift with a decorative box , galvanized bucket , wicker or wire basket or even a cute kitchen strainer . add a few different items to fit the occasion like kitchen towels , soaps , a candle and maybe some yummy quick bread or cookies with the recipe ! visit my blog crafty2thecore.com

diy lamp | home decor craft | apostrophe s | limelight<q>hi , it 's jill with apostrophe s. today i want to show you how to make our newest kit limelight . it 's this awesome lantern for the summer and this is great . okay , i 'm showing you the picture because the lantern itself is pretty large , but you can see here how darling this is and it 's really fun to make . so i 'll show it to you .<q>okay , so first of all , here 's all of the stuff that you need to make it . you 've got some wax paper to keep your tabletop smooth , all of the wood pieces , these vellum pieces that make the lantern window . you 've got glue , paint , some masking tape , the actual light and a sponge to do the painting with .<q>okay and then what you 're going to need from home is we suggest that you have a couple of heavy books to help press stuff down for the gluing , and then a wet rag , or actually a damp rag , not too wet , and then a cup of water , again , to help with the painting .<q>so one of the first things that i want to show you is all of the pieces are labeled , just like we 've done with our other wooden kits . okay , so the base part of this kit is all labeled with -- the pieces all have an " a " on them . those are the lantern 's base . then the part that 's illuminated , the middle , are all labeled with " b " . and then the top part are all labeled with " c " . so let me show you a little bit about what those pieces actually look like . i do n't know if you can see this , but you can see the letters there . this is 2a bottom , 2a top . the top and the bottom , the bottom shows that it goes in like this and this is the top edge . so the top is up here . the bottom is down here and it just kind of helps you orient the piece . these are just a couple of the pieces so that you can see how they 're all labeled , okay ?<q>now the first thing to do with this kit is that because of the lasering , the pieces have a little bit of burn look on them . now some people like the look of that and can do the white washing over it to kind of give it kind of a funky rugged look . others might want to get rid of that . so the only thing that you need to do to get rid of that kind of burned look , is to just take your wet rag and kind of rub those . be careful of these spindles , because they 're , you know , so thin and you do n't want to , you do n't want to break them .<q>and when the whole thing is glued and put together , it 's really fabulous . the light you just take the light , pinch it , and slide it into the hole at the bottom and release these , and then put the cord through the holes , turn it on , and you 're ready to go .<q>so , that 's all there is to it .<q>limelight . apostrophe s. make it yours !<q>for the best diy crafts that are both fun and

i guarantee i can teach you to master photoshop . learn how : https://phlearn.com/aaronwillteachyou<q>how to remove wrinkles in photoshop<q>retouching wrinkles on someone 's face can be a very * touchy * matter ! today we show you how to both completely remove wrinkles as well as reduce them in a more subtle manner .<q>complete removal<q>the healing brush tool is our best friend in terms of removing wrinkles ! be sure to use a brush size that is slightly larger than the wrinkle , and then sample a color right below the wrinkle to paint over it ( alt/opt + click ) . make sure to select " current & below " for the sampling .<q>this technique must be used very carefully , as it is easy to make an elderly face look too smooth .<q>a more subtle approach<q>for a more natural approach , we can use the clone stamp tool . duplicate the background layer ( cmd + j ) to work on a layer with pixels . if you are on a new layer rather than a duplicated one , this technique will not work . also , be sure to select the " lighten " mode ; this paints over the wrinkle in a less obvious manner to conceal the lines .<q>this tends to be a quicker process than using the healing brush tool , because it simply lightens to darkest parts of the wrinkles and does not pull skin texture from other parts of the face .<q>website : http://phlearn.com<q>facebook : https://www.facebook.com/phlearn<q>google + : https://plus.google.com/u/0/116791098 ...

the m60 main battle tank was the pre-m1 abrams workhorse of us army and marine corps armoured units . chrysler began production of the m60 in 1959 and put several hundred into service as early as 1961 . approximately 15,000 m60s were built before production ceased in 1983 .<q>the m60 saw service with the israeli army during the yom kippur war and served as the us marines main battle tank during operation desert storm when the 1st marine expeditionary force fielded 210 m60a1s to support the saudi-marine drive into kuwait city . the m60 was not widely utilized in viet nam , but did support us action in lebanon and grenada during the 1980s .<q>until 1997 , the m60 served as the primary main battle tank for us reserve and national guard armoured units . developed from the m48 patton series , the m60 was fitted with a 105 mm main gun and manned by a four-man crew .<q>besides its main gun , m60 series tanks are equipped with a 7.62 mm m240 coaxial machine gun and 12.7 mm m85 anti-aircraft gun . power is provided by a continental avds-1790-2c 750 hp engine and an allison cd-850-6 / 6a power shift cross drive transmission .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scbrvaop3mk<q>published on sep 6 , 2018<q>linda moulton howe starts off with elon musk 's comments to american governors at a meeting in rhode island : " artificial intelligence is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization and i do n't think people really appreciate that . " with video and images , linda will lay out the emerging problems of applying a. i. to robots , especially those under development for military applications with weapons , and those problems include the potential for robots to lethally turn on their human makers .<q>as humanity is rapidly moving to depend on a. i. robot support , people in the ufo/e . t. abduction syndrome have been saying for decades that some of the beings they have dealt with were clearly someone else 's programmed androids and robots .
first off , got the idea for this feeder and hide from watching videos posted by ` squirrel hunter ' . his videos are very good , check um ' out . this basically is a squirrel feeder , holding whole maze , which i made to attract the squirrels down so i can shoot them . i also built a hide so i can sit nice and comfy while i wait for them , i put up 6 bird boxes and the squirrels have chewed their way in and had the eggs or young from the boxes , thus making them useless . i also built an owl nesting box , but while there are so many squirrels about it 's pointless putting it up because they 'll be straight in it and make a dray . the gun that was used is a cz 452 .22 lr , it 's got a mamba lite scope , saks moderator and i was shooting 40g winchester hollow point subs .<q>update . i have now gone over to wheat as the squirrels only take a little nibble out of the maze then drop it on the ground . so out of the 20 kg that was in the feeder , about 18 kg went on the floor .

welcome to sugar plum dolls - i am sharing with you my progress on creating a turtle pond habitat for my turtle .<q>the turtle story !<q>i was working in a school about 12 years ago and there were two small turtles in a classroom . i thought they were cute , since i had a turtle when i was a child - pokey the turtle - i had fond memories of him . i used to visit the turtles in the classroom a lot ! anyway one christmas i was asked to take the turtles home because the classroom teacher could not . ultimately she became ill ( she was a wonderful teacher ) and i ended up with the turtles permanently . i moved from one state to another and the the turtles , my dogs , all came with me . for the last few years the turtles ( there used to be 2 ) lived in a pond outside on my patio . the first winter i thought they would die , but after doing some research i learned they would hibernate . for a few more years both turtles did well , then one spring the smaller of the two was no longer with us :( the larger turtle who we think is a girl , continued on , i have always thought she is lonely , but she seems to enjoy the company of people and my dogs who look in on her from time to time . finally , this summer , i decided to build her a bigger pond . i bought some untreated wood - 2x12 's and had them cut into ( 4 ) 4foot lengths for the ends and ( 4 ) 6 foot lengths for the sides . and some 1 " x4 " for the edges . oh and yes the large 10x13 plastic liner . i already had a pump , but still need a bigger and better one , i think . i did a lot of research on the how to build one , but mostly just went with an idea , no pattern or blueprints . it worked out well , but if i had it to do again , i would plan better . hopefully the wood and plastic will last at least 5 years or so . . thanks for watching , i hope you enjoyed the videos . there are 3 int total - i will post updates even now and then !<q>welcome to sugarplumdolls.com where you can learn to sew , craft , create , grow , enjoy !<q>about this channel ! how to make arts and crafts projects . handmade , homemade dolls , gardening , cooking and more ! bake , sew , craft and grow ! for more tips and ideas visit http://sugarplumdolls.com<q>this video blog is a personal blog written and edited by me . for questions about this blog , please contact sugarplumdolls@gmail.com<q>also feel free to follow me , post pictures , join or share with others on :<q>i invite you to follow me on :<q>twitter : http://twitter.com/sugarplumdolls<q>online shop : http://www.etsy.com/shop/clothespindolls<q>blog : http://http://sugarplumdolls.wordpress.com<q>facebook : https://www.facebook.com/sugarplumdollsfriends ****** ***** ******<q>who am i ? i 'm sugarplumdolls.com welcome to my world where you can learn how to make handmade homemade dolls , make and sew your own purses , grow a garden , cook great comfort foods and much , much , more ! new for 2020 you can buy supplies for your projects online ! i want to thank you in advance for your support !<q>*****************************************<q>follow me :<q>instagram https://www.instagram.com/sugarplumclothespindolls/<q>twitter https://twitter.com/sugarplumdolls<q>facebook https://www.facebook.com/sugarplumdolls<q>facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/handmadedollclothes<q>my second youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/user/sugarplumdolls<q>shop my etsy store for digital patterns and downloads :<q>https://www.etsy.com/shop/clothespindolls<q>shop my store : http://sugarplumdolls.com<q>email : sugarplumdolls@gmail.com<q>to leave a little tip $ $ $ https://www.patreon.com/sugarplumdolls<q>online classes : https://www.udemy.com/user/sugarplumdollscom/<q>https://sugarplumdollscom-arts-crafts.teachable.com/<q>do n't forget to subscribe for more videos !! @clothespindolls or @sugarplumdolls<q>comment below for any other videos you would like to see me create and post !<q>full disclaimer : i make a small commission on my amazon and other affiliate links .<q>for business inquiries please contact me by email for only paid promotions or sponsorships .<q>if you have questions about anything else please leave them in the comments section below .<q>please understand i am not represented by a manager or management company . any business emails from me sugarplum are sent from the email listed above . all the others are scams .<q>mean emails or mean comments will not be responded to . i just ca n't deal with negativity this year ! thanks !<q>#crafts #handmade #diy #art #craft #christmas #crafting #crafty #creative #gifts #design #love #homedecor #handcrafted #fashion #diycrafts #etsy #artist #artsandcrafts #crafter #decor #crochet #giftideas #jewelry #handmadecrafts #gift #smallbusiness #papercrafts #homemade #sewing #sidehustle #womanownedbusiness #blackownedbusiness #sugarplumdolls

in his best-selling book the myth of the rational voter ( 2007 ) george mason university economist bryan caplan demythologized the notion that american voters know what they are doing when they step into the ballot booth .<q>in his new book , selfish reasons to have more kids : why being a great parent is less work and more fun than you think , caplan does the same for the conventional wisdom about parenting . in a world of tiger moms and helicopter parents who monitor and agonize over every minor activity in which their children engage , the father of three says that parents actually have minimal influence over long-term outcomes for their children . rather than fretting over whether junior is admitted into baby einstein violin programs , caplan argues that parents should relax and learn to enjoy their kids ' childhood .<q>reason 's nick gillespie sat down with caplan to discuss the research behind and the reception of his unconventional theory .<q>shot by jim epstein and meredith bragg . edited by meredith bragg . about 7:30 minutes .<q>visit www.reason.tv for ipod , hd and audio versions of this and all our videos and subscribe to reason.tv 's youtube channel to receive automatic notifications when new material goes live . .

origami twist is on instagram ! - @origamitwist<q>a friend of mine requested that i make this tutorial for the flower popup card as she had watched several videos on how to create it and found that she needed a bit more explanation about how the individual pieces go together . so , by request , here is a detailed tutorial of the popular flower pop up card with lots of talking and detail ! it 's a lot of fun to put together and would make a lovely gift on its own , let alone as a card ! happy folding !<q>i had a request to move daily december up a little bit , since most of them are holiday themed crafts . this way there will be more time for you to use the projects for christmas presents and activities . i had filmed half of them before making this decision , so most of the dates will correspond with a daily december theme , but the 31st video in the series will be published on boxing day , the 26th of december , instead of on new year 's eve as originally planned .<q>i hope you enjoy them ! have a great holiday season , everyone !<q>to buy digital teabag folding tiles to print out for this project :<q>http://www.origamitwist.com<q>tissue paper flower pompoms : https://youtu.be/flk7sjhhcss<q>youtube :<q>http://www.youtube.com/origamitwist<q>facebook :<q>http://www.facebook.com/origamitwithatwist<q>pinterest :<q>http://www.pinterest.com/origamitwist

coroner kenneth holmes works to identify the cause of death when an inmate passes away under custody in marin county , california .<q>after 12 years on the job , he finds dealing with the inmates ' families " crushing " , as they often ask him questions about the inmate 's death that he ca n't answer . the coroner 's office performs an autopsy on every person who dies in the county if the cause and matter of death is not clear .<q>inmates , said holmes , are treated just as any other person who dies in the county .<q>but the rules imposed by the california department of corrections and rehabilitation sets inmates apart . for security reasons , families of sick inmates are not allowed to visit if the inmate is too ill to go to the visiting areas of the prison or if they were transported to an outside hospital .<q>this often leaves families with no chance to say goodbye , even if their relatives inside prison are sick in a hospital bed for months .<q>this lack of closure and information , says holmes , makes the process of mourning harder on the inmates ' families .<q>photos by karen mcintyre<q>reporting by isabella cota<q>production by mcintyre and cota<q>mt. tamalpais mortuary and cemetery , san rafael , california<q>this piece is part of the 2010 news21 project " behind bars : the california convict cycle " , produced in uc berkeley .

here is how to locate all the radio station locations in your area to test the signal reception of your radio . also , how to make a crude diy home made rdf radio direction finder .<q>i recently purchased a highly recommended $ 10 am/fm radio , the sony am/fm icf-s10mk2 to use as a back up or travel radio . i was told the sony was excellent in its ability to receive many am radio stations .<q>i purchased it on amazon .<q>when i received it i found i could get about 17 am stations in my car during the daytime , while my car radio got a lot more , close to 30 .<q>i located an internet site called radio-locator.com that is excellent as it gives an exact amount of the number , identity and location of radio stations a user can expect to find and receive a signal from in their location .<q>i later used my sony at night in an apartment off the ground floor and received more signals than when in my car .<q>i am pretty happy with the radio .<q>i do n't know how many people realize it , but am radios can also be used as crude radio direction finders , or rdf .<q>when you are receiving a good signal with your am station , rotate the radio until the radio signal decreases to its minimum . at this direction , the radio antenna will be aligned with the radio transmission tower and either be pointed directly at it or 180 degrees opposite . obtain the bearings of many stations and you can triangulate and obtain an approximate position of your location on a chart that has the locations of the radio towers on it .<q>i made a simple and crude rdf as shown in this video by printing out a 360 degree compass rose and aligned it with magnetic north . i then placed a small piece of wood on the center of the compass rose to use as a pointer and set my radio on top . when i rotate the radio i can see where i am getting the weakest signal , which will give me the direction or compass bearing the radio station is from me . if i get several other radio station transmission tower bearings i can then use them to find out where my location is on a map .<q>if you use radio-locator.com , you can locate all the radio stations in your area and print out a chart to use that will allow you to use your am radio as a simple but crude rdf .<q>if you have never made a google map before , i made short video showing how . here<q>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koh9rrmsoda&list=uupb14plslojg2ahocehi4qw&index=55<q>making a crude rdf is just for fun , no one needs an rdf anymore with gps navigation , but if we ever lose the gps satellites it will be good to know this trick allowing us to use am radio for navigation .
for more information , visit :<q>https://www.auroramarine.com/surestep<q>clean and shine non-skid boat decks<q>textured non-skid or anti-slip boat decks , cockpits and swim platforms provides important traction , but they all suffer from the same problems . they 're constantly getting chalky and dirty . they stain easily from fish blood , red wine and bird droppings . they require constant scrubbing to keep them clean . they get dull , making your boat look old and tired before its time . and , you ca n't protect them with boat wax without making them dangerously slippery , especially when they 're wet .<q>it does n't matter if yours is a fishing boat , a sailboat a rib , a wakeboard boat or a cruiser . maintaining non-skid boat decks is the most tedious part of boat cleaning . there 's no end to it .<q>but now , there 's a better way . sure step promises to restore your faded boat deck to like new again and reduce your maintenance . imagine your boat decks looking shiny and new and never having to scrub them again . that 's what sure step can do for you .<q>today , we 're going to show you how easy it is to restore the deck on this tired 1987 sea ray . with sure step<q>the deck of this boat has more chalk than a math teacher 's blackboard and look at the dirt and stains . sure step is a sealer as well as a protective polish . we need to get this deck pristine so we do n't seal in the crud .<q>first , we 're going to clean a small test area to verify that we get the results we want and to make sure there are no unexpected problems .<q>this looks good . can you see how bright white it is ? it almost fluoresces.i ca n't stress enough how important it is to get the surface spotless .<q>the finished job can only look as good as the gelcoat , before we seal it with the sure step anti slip coating . boat clean plus and boat scrub are the best products you can use for this boat cleaning . no other boat deck cleaner can give you the same results . these two cleaners will deep clean the gelcoat , not just the surface and remove any chalk or oxidation . and they 're free rinsing so there 's no residue to impair attachment of the sure step .<q>now that we have a successful test , getting this deck clean will be quick and straight forward . we 'll use the deck brush for the large areas , a scrub brush for the tighter areas and a marine power mitt for the smooth surfaces .<q>first wash the deck with boat clean plus . apply some boat scrub and give it a good scrubbing . now rinse everything clean . these products are biodegradable so they wo n't hurt the lake or the fish .<q>check the surface for marks and stains that did n't come out . i can see that the birds have been in the berry patch and have left stains in the gelcoat .<q>use a 50 -- 50 solution of boat clean plus and boat scrub and scrub the stains out . this may require some effort , but , they will come out .<q>let the deck dry completely so you do n't seal moisture into the gelcoat .<q>now we can apply sure step to all surfaces , non-skid as well as smooth . use a white , high density foam , mini paint roller .<q>they work best . you can press the sure step into the pores and spread it out thinly so you get maximum coverage and do n't waste material . do the whole deck including the walk around areas and let it dry to a haze .<q>here 's a tip from a professional boat detailer . wipe the deck with a soft cloth before buffing in order to remove excessive surface haze . this will reduce buffing time .<q>buffing is the easy part . attach a loose cotton buffing wheel to a portable drill and your special buffing machine is ready .<q>by the way.rotary buffers do n't work on non-skid surfaces .<q>lightly buff the deck until it shines . let the wheel do the work for you.the cotton fibres get into the crevices and polish out the haze . alternate the direction to buff out all the surfaces . this is easy and fun .<q>look at the how the shine is starting to come up on this old boat deck . and , this is only the sealer coat . is n't that beautiful ?<q>we need to let the 1st coat cure for a minimum of 24 hours before we apply the polish coat .<q>because of the weather , it 's been a week since we applied the sealer coat so we 're going to rinse off any dirt and bird droppings before applying the polish coat . since the deck is already sealed , dirt will hose off easily .<q>the 2nd sure step polish coat goes on just like the 1st , with a paint roller . when it dries to a haze , give it a quick wipe and buff it to a beautiful shine .<q>there you have it . shiny , clean and looking brand new again .<q>to prove that this deck is not slippery and safe to walk on , we sprayed it with water and then got pete to walk on it . nope ! no slipping . you even get more grip when the decks are wet . this is an important safety feature of sure step deck polish and protector .<q>the products featured in this video are :<q>sure step<q>https://www.auroramarine.com/store/sure-step.html<q>boat clean plus<q>https://www.auroramarine.com/store/boat-clean-plus.html<q>boat scrub<q>https://www.auroramarine.com/store/boat-scrub.html

dayton -- officers have been using stop sticks for several years.while law enforcement recognizes they can be dangerous , they say the reward of getting a high speed car off the streets , outweighs the risk they take.the recent accident involving dayton police officer willie hooper is an example of how dangerous their job can be , but also how they take the risks willingly . " officers will jeopardize their own safety in an effort to prevent our citizens from being hurt or killed , " said sgt. joe weisman , training sgt. at the dayton police academy.recruits learn how to properly deploy stop sticks before they hit the streets . " there are stop stick training kits that you can use to practice with , " said sgt. weisman.they also watch training videos made by the maker of stop sticks.but the danger does n't end with police , troopers also face the same challenges . " officers have to be mindful to deploy or not deploy within seconds , " said sgt. jeff kramer , ohio state highway patrol dayton post.second that can change a life . but it 's a risk all law enforcement are willing to take . " just putting a uniform on in the morning or at night , just putting that uniform on poses a significant risk , " said sgt. kramer.dayton police are looking into alternatives , where officers would n't even have to step foot onto the road.it 's called the viper . " it comes out of essentially a suitcase , it 's a hard case , suitcase so the officer deploys from a distance remotely , away from the vehicle , " said assistant police chief bob chabali , dayton police department.he says the new technology is n't out just yet , and costs five times as much as the original stop sticks.but for him the decision is easy . " 25-hundred dollars is peanuts to what an injured officer would cost the police department let alone the death of an officer , " said asst. chief chabali .

meet patches . she 's like a member of the family but sometimes , she finds herself in the doghouse ! why ? barf cleanup ! if you licked the hair off yourself all day , i guess you 'd barf , too ! the most common form of cat throw-up is the hairball and the easiest way to clean that off your furniture or carpet is to just let it dry and then simply lift or scrape it away . do n't use liquid cleaners on a hairball barf -- those will smear the hairball goo into your carpet . if the barf is not a ball - or log-shaped clump of hair , but an icky liquid or food-based slime , here 's what to do : carefully blot up the excess throw-up with a rag or paper towel , taking care to rub as little as possible into your rug . then mix one tablespoon of baking soda with one-half tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide . this will make a thin , spreadable paste . spread this paste over the barf spot , covering it completely ( double the mixture if needed ) . if the barf is on a delicate or patterned material such as an oriental rug , test the paste on an inconspicuous area , since hydrogen peroxide can yellow some materials . let it sit until its dry ( two hours to overnight ) , then vacuum it . the barf goo should come up with the dried baking soda paste .

it 's hard to believe , but it 's been nearly five years since we last went traipsing about soho grading bike locking with hal ruzal from bicycle habitat . thus it was time for another hillarious chapter with the mechanic who wears pink-purple socks and admonishing you about your ability to lock your wheels , frame and seat correctly so you can keep it for another day .<q>the process is simple : hal and i spend about an hour walking around and whatever happens i try to capture it on the fly . ( which is even harder than it sounds . ) this time it led to quite a few surprises and - as usual - many hilarious scenes . we also had a few friends stop by and learned at the shop that hal has become an international celebrity . and wait until you see what happened when we came upon a citibike station . let 's just say hal was impressed .<q>the previous three streetfilms in this series have done nearly 250,000 plays . below we list links to them for your viewing pleasure .<q>vimeo.com/12061685 2003 's hal grades your bike locking )<q>vimeo.com/12061617 2008 's hal & kerri grade your bike locking )<q>vimeo.com/12061782 2009 's hal grades your bike locking 3 : the final warning )

note : this video is to help the self installer who has a self install kit from the cable company through a difficult process .<q>note : this video is not about stealing cable . it is not about<q>connecting the cable to comcast or any providers vtaps .<q>this is the job of the cable installer . they will install the cable here in this room . you should not and must not install the cable .<q>you are only looking to see what the cable looks like .<q>this is about visual hands off verification of what cable from here goes into your home . that 's it .<q>this is simply showing you how you might tell which cable that is goin g into your house will be the cable from this area which is live .<q>the installer has already installed your cable . you are just verifying that the cable was installed .<q>after all if your cable is not connected here , then your self install will not work at home as you will have no signal .<q>just because the self installer kit came in the mail and the cable boxes came in the mail - it does not mean the installer got to your address yet and made the connection to the live cable network yet .<q>as my other videos show - you 'll have one main cable coming in from the cable provider ( this one ) and a bunch of cables going to different rooms .<q>you will need to connect up a splitter to handle this situation .<q>to figure out which cable inside your house has<q>the main cable signal<q>you may want to check outside first<q>find your cable outside and take a picture of it .<q>and make sure your cable is connected to the cable operator .<q>to any cable installers who do n't like this video - due to your nasty comments - i have disabled posting comments to this video .<q>peace out .

best homemade deodorant making tips . you do n't need fancy equipment to make your own deodorant . here is a quick tip on deodorant making . follow the recipe . i give example of small amount of beeswax beads left in bottom of bag . i thought hey i 'll just kill the bag . i added what seemed like an insignificant amount of extra beeswax to my mix . the resulting product had a substantially higher melting point and was much stickier . what does that mean in deodorant terms . it would not apply very well since body temperature barely brought it to melting point where the stick meets the pits . it was sticky means if your a hairy dude or dudette , you are going to lose some hair bikini wax style . ouch ! lesson . you are making a chemical mixture here using natural oils , binders , deodorizers and antiperspirants . minor chemistry changes can drastically change properties of finished products . first batch stick to the plan . if you do experiment i would consider a per recipe batch and experimental batch . test both products to see what your modification of the recipe did to the finished product .<q>please like , subscribe and share . please support dan 's daughters ' containers on ebay and amazon . thank you . affiliate links below if you click a link and make a purchase i will get a very small commission without costing you anything . thank you for your support .<q>five clear 2.12 ounce containers - http://amzn.to/2f53wkw<q>five white 2.65 ounce containers - http://amzn.to/2xvyqit<q>http://stores.ebay.com/dansdaughterscontainers/<q>https://goo.gl/3cylgq<q>https://www.amazon.com/s?marketplaceid=atvpdkikx0der&me=a1d85sp49ckqkm&merchant=a1d85sp49ckqkm&redirect=true

this is such a great coffee maker ! i 'm genuinely happy with this . some of the cool features are and easy to read control panel . it lights up blue and is easy to program . my absolute favorite part is that the lcd screen will display how long the coffee has been warming . after the brewing process is over the screen will start to count time up to let you know how old the coffee is . no more cups of burnt old coffee for me . the glass carafe is very nice quality . it 's not thin and brittle like some coffee makers are including . it 's a nice quality one with strong glass . the handle has ridges for your fingers to help you to grip it better . the water level indicator is lit up as well . this is going to make it very easy to see the water line without having to shift the machine or any of the other things you had to do sometimes to make it easier to see . it 's lit up so you can immediately tell how much water is in it at a glance . it holds 20 small cups of coffee or 12 of the larger cups of coffee . it 's a very generous machine the filter basket is easily removable for cleaning . the permanent coffee filter included is a nice wiring mesh . it 's not the cheap plastic kind but some newer coffee makers are coming with . it 's another good quality part to this machine . it takes about five and a half minutes to brew an entire pot . it bruised quietly and discreetly . it has an automatic brew features so you can set it to have hot coffee ready for you when you wake up in the morning . you have the option of brewing an entire pot or just brewing a small pot for 1 to 4 cups . it 's very easy to program this machine . the instructions are very clear and include photos and large print period if i was purchasing this for a gift for somebody i would be very confident that they would love it as much as i do . i am very happily giving this coffee maker an entire five stars .<q>i bought it from here : https://www.amazon.com/digital-programmable-coffeemaker-polished-stainless/dp/b06y1zd6tt/ref=cm_rdp_product

i have always wanted an " official " grooming halter . so i went to my usual horse tack websites to price them , and i was shocked to find that the cheapest grooming halter was $ 40.00 ! and since i would be buying two , one for each horse , $ 80.00 was more than i wanted to spend on something i consider to be a luxury item .<q>so then i started to plot how i could make my own grooming halter for a lot less money , and i found a way !<q>i bought a really inexpensive halter from state line tack . it was $ 4.63 . it is single ply nylon webbing , so it is easier to cut through .<q>and then i just cut off the throat latch part , and wala ! instant grooming halter !<q>do n't forget to subscribe to my channel for lots of diy horse related projects , giveaways , jump ideas , and well everything related to horses .<q>https://www.youtube.com/channel/uclocgpjieouhupbz1iaw70w<q>and check out my website :<q>http://www.budgetequestrian.com/<q>we are getting awfully close to 1000 subscribers , and when that happens ... bam ! it will be time for a giveaway ! so be sure to subscribe , and share this channel with your friends so we can get this giveaway underway !!!!!!<q>thanks for watching !

undercover ultra flex : https://www.midwestaftermarket.com/undercover-ultra-flex-hard-folding-tonneau-cover.php?search=ultra+flex<q>undercover swing cases :<q>https://www.midwestaftermarket.com/undercover-swingcase.php?search=swing+case<q>the all new undercover ultra flex is a brand new hard folding truck bed cover that has all of the benefits as the undercover flex but now there 's more . the ultra finished under panel now gives a carpet-like finish that provides ultimate protection with a touch of class . each cover also comes standard with saddlebag storage and a luminous bed lighting system . it also features a new ultra easy tailgate seal that allows you to close the cover whether your tailgate is up or down . if you 're looking for a sleek , easy to install cover that is covered by a lifetime warranty , the undercover ultra flex is the tonneau cover for you !<q>the undercover swing cases are designed to provide convenient storage for your truck bed while allowing the box to swing out for easy access . the cases are lockable to keep everything secure and they quickly remove so you can take your gear with you . the case is designed to stand up on it 's own once removed from the truck bed .<q>questions ? feel free to contact us directly at 800-951-3955 .<q>subscribe to our channel : https://www.youtube.com/channel/uco04rcbnhfopo8op5et58bg<q>facebook : https://www.facebook.com/midwestaftermarket/<q>twitter : https://twitter.com/midwestamkt<q>instagram : https://www.instagram.com/midwestaftermarket/<q>linkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/10260310/<q>snapchat : midwestamkt<q>transcript :<q>hey everybody , it 's heather with midwest aftermarket , i am with mike from undercover and he 's going to show us the brand new ultra flex .<q>so the brand new ultra flex is the newest folding cover from undercover . you 're familiar with the flex , this is actually our premium matte finish style which is what we call the ultra flex . the biggest noticed difference between the flex and the ultra flex is the new rigid tailgate . you can actually close , open and close the tailgate without lifting the cover . it has a three piece seal on the underneath side so it allows the cover to seal properly around here . a new feature is now we have gone from frp fiberglass reinforced polymer which is a plastic to an aluminum sheet . it is 30 % stronger and dent resistant than most of the competitors out there . underneath side , we added another feature to it , it 's actually carpeted by bedrug . it gives it more of a finished look underneath , it also keeps it quiet when you 're folding it . so the carpet adds a nice touch to it .<q>it still has the standard features of the flex , still props up there and keeps it off the glass . it also still straps in the same position as the flex would here . another key feature of the ultra flex is we changed the design of the rail . we 've gone from a standard flat rail to an l shaped rail which allows for easier installation on the flex . one of the last things to is you 'll notice on the finish , it is that premium matte finish . matte is hot right now in the aftermarket so we 've got a new matte finish product .<q>a couple additional features that come with the cover is that you get two b lights , so two led light strips and a storage bag with a 5 year warranty on ultra flex .<q>so these are going to be available december 1st you said ?<q>they will start to ship to the public right around december 1st .<q>so that was the ultra flex , now let 's talk about these cool little toolboxes on the inside . these are the undercover swing cases . so the undercover swing case is a storage box that is movable , it 's not stationary , you have trays . it is an injected , molded piece and it locks to the bed with a clamp system . it is also removable , swing it off , take it to the job site , take it hunting fishing you name it . i have heard they make coolers out of them . so basically you have a box with a bracket on top that attaches to the bracket here that is actually drilled into your bed here .<q>so you do have to drill it into your bed ?<q>you do have to drill it into your bed . the f-150 is a non-drill application that actually goes in a bracket here under the taillight lens . with the new fords going to aluminum , you ca n't drill into aluminum . once you put it back right on , close it , it 's locked right there to the bed . we have a lock capability right here up top . you also if you 've got a cover and you 're throwing your wallet keys in there , you can actually lock it to a padlock here . it will actually secure it to the truck .<q>alright well that was mike with undercover . that 's the new ultra flex and the new swing cases . if you guys have any questions or need more information , visit our website at midwestaftermarket.com<q>thanks .

today we will be doing a demonstration of the tollen 's test and the silver mirror .<q>the tollen 's test is mainly used to identify aldehyde groups ( forms a silver mirror ) and it was historically used a lot . it was slowly replaced with more accurate and better techniques . however , it is still very useful for hobbyist who ca n't afford big expensive machines .<q>the silver mirror is kind of an off-shoot of the tollen test , where all we are after is the mirror that forms . we use glucose because it is a cheap and easy aldehyde source .<q>in the future , i might make a video where i identify an uknown chemical using a series of classic techniques .<q>silver nitrate video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eruzavv2odc<q>------------------------------------------<q>merch store ( nilered pin & stickers ) : https://store.dftba.com/collections/nilered<q>nilered website ( glassware & beaker mugs ) : https://nile.red<q>patreon : https://www.patreon.com/nilered<q>instagram : https://www.instagram.com/nile.red<q>twitter : https://twitter.com/nilered2<q>facebook : https://www.facebook.com/nilered2<q>discord : https://discord.gg/3bt6uhf
how to make a spinning flagpole complete<q>flag attachment & velcro information :<q>q : how did you attach the fabric over the velcro and is it necessary to use velcro ?<q>a : i use velcro so i can change my flags or i might not be able to easily take my flags on and off . i only use a small piece of velcro about the size of a postal stamp or smaller . i attach the velcro to both pole and flag .<q>important : i try to make sure to use the same velcro sections are placed on the poles and the reversed velcro piece on the flags . reason : so you can easily change flags and not have to worry about the flag getting twisted while spinning . also , you can easily switch up poles and flags at any time without having to worry that the same velcro sections are attached on the opposite piece ( e.g. both flag and pole having smooth sections and then do not stick together ) . it keeps things simple if you always start out the same way and place the same velcro sections on the same spot on the flag and opposite to the pole . even if you intend to only make one or always keep the same flag attached , something could happen in time and it can save a lot of time and hassle ! i started out making 2 and now have at least 20 . i write on the velcro package : " smooth side : pole " and " rough side : flag " so i do not forget over time & check a flag to make sure .<q>another thing to keep in mind regarding velcro that i experienced the hard way is that in most cases , simple & inexpensive ( not professional grade ) velcro works fine unless it 's for a recital or event where you 're not going to change flags & must ensure the flag stays put . i once used a large strip of professional grade velcro when first starting . everything was fine until the day i needed to change the flags . wow ! i had no idea how tight some velcro can hold ! i almost tore my flag trying to get the sections apart . now , i use pre-shaped velcro squares or circles sold really cheap at walmart -- the sizes are small and work well . i have some really large flags ( +50 " ) and they hold up well ! the small sections of velcro make it easier to adjust if needed . lightly align the velcro sections in place without pressing the pieces firmly in place . this way , it 's much easier to adjust the location ( s ) if desired .<q>attaching flag to the flagpole ( shaft ) :<q>use adhesive backed velcro tabs to attach to one side of the flag and the other to the flag pole . make sure you use the same side of the velcro tab for all of your flag poles and use the other side of the velcro tabs for all of the flags so you have the ability to can change flags on your poles . put the velcro tabs inside of the flags near each end and do the same on the flag poles spinners near each end . slide the flag down the flag pole and push the velcro tabs together .<q>where to buy flag parts & weighted ball information :<q>www.worshipproducts.com or click on or copy/paste this link : http://worshipproducts.com/html/tubes_parts.html<q>the website sells separate parts to make a flagpole even tubing and end tip .<q>important : please try to make sure that your weighted ball has an opening that 's slightly larger than the size dowel rod you are using . weighted balls come in various sizes .<q>q : what stores might sell round balls ?<q>a : most of the time i use 1-1/2 " unpainted wooden balls with pre-drilled holes from crafts stores such as ac moore , joanns , michaels , etc. another option for a really good ball end at a very reasonable price is online at worship products :<q>i now use clear 5/8 " water tubing for the spinning tubes instead of pvc piping . i buy it at hardware stores such as home depot & lowes really cheap . it is sold in long rolls of 10 0r 20 feet and cuts much easier . it can straighten out easily by being weighed down overnight . it weighs a lot less and looks really nice on the finished product !<q>another thing that i forgot to mention is the hardware stores such as home depot also sell some of the best dowel rods at very cheap prices that are usually extremely straight and come in a range of diameter ( width ) sizes and usually longer ( about 48 inches long ) than those sold in craft stores ( about 36 inches long ) . however , if the dowel rod is too thin in diameter ( width ) it can break when spun too hard ( although i have never had one do so ) . for very young children , you can also try using thinner diameter ( width ) rods and thinner water hoses . the water hose is really helpful if you need lighter flags and it looks really nice on a pole ( s ) stored without an attached flag ( s ) . just make sure the dowel rod has enough space to spin inside of the hosing , pvc piping , or whatever you decide to use . sometimes the water hosing is listed under the inner size of the hose and/or outer size ... make sure the inner size ( diameter ) of the hose allows enough space for the dowel rods and they are not the same size . ( i have almost bought the wrong size more times than i would like to admit . i grab a dowel rod off the shelf or bring one with me to double check just to be on the safe side !

a quick video of my first ferret hutch and how i 've got it setup along with plans and ideas for the future .<q>i was looking for a setup that provided a lot of space for the ferrets when they 're not out playing or working . i won this hutch on an ebay auction for £ 27 and had to repaint it with some ferret safe paint but that 's all so it was quite a bargain .<q>i intent to put a ferret hammock into the top section of the cage and some pipes and tunnels in the bottom section along with a selection of ferret safe toys which i 'll keep rotated to keep them interested . since ferrets like to snuggle down i 've brought some fleece material from ikea for £ 3 which i 'm going to cut up into sections for the bedding area . i should have sufficient to rotate it around and change it when required .<q>a ferret sized litter tray in in the bottom of the hutch setup and so the hutch can be easily cleaned and disinfected i 'm going to install some plastic flooring in both the top and bottom tiers .<q>should anyone have an questions , comments or advice then please leave a message in the comments box below .

http://www.realfarmacy.com/why-you-should-never-throw-away-orange-or-banana-peels/<q>why you should never throw away orange or banana peels<q>orange-banana-peels<q>did you know the peels of some fruits hold some of the most powerful nutrients in the world ? there are many uses , both medicinal and practical , for orange and banana peels that are n't known by many . so , next time you think about throwing away one of these peels , you may want to remember this information .<q>orange peels<q>it 's always a good idea to minimize pesticide levels by choosing organic oranges . oranges tend to be grown with lower pesticide usage than most fruits but a good cleaning with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of white vinegar in 1 cup of water will remove almost any pesticide with ease .<q>an orange 's peel and apple 's skin are similar because most of the nutrients are in the skin of these fruits . according to rebecca wood , author of the new whole foods encyclopedia , " one medium orange contains over 60 flavonoids and 170 different phytonutrients . " they are good for your skin , your system and your home too . dr. jaishree bhattacharjee , ayurvedic consultant with satvikshop helps us find out its different uses .<q>medicinal properties of orange peels<q>as per ayurveda , orange peel is tikta ( bitter ) and it improves digestion and can speed up your metabolism . it helps to naturally beat gas , heartburn , vomiting and acidic eructation . it 's also great to perk up your appetite and relieve nausea .<q>due to its pacifying properties , orange peel powder helps dissolve phlegm in respiratory systems , alleviate coughs , and asthma .<q>most of the beneficiary aspects of orange peels come from their essential oils , which have anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties . essential oil " d-limonene " has the ability to defuse stomach acids and maintain normal intestinal movements . it also promotes normal liver function .<q>studies have shown that orange peel can dissolve cholesterol and triglyceride . that means consumption of an orange peel can benefit obese people who have high cholesterol levels . it has a flavonoid known as hesperidine , which is said to be effective against colon cancer and osteoporosis .<q>essential oils from orange peels are sedative in nature so it makes them great for calming nerves and inducing sleep . use orange peels in baths , simmer in a pot to uplift your mood , or beat insomnia naturally .<q>beauty properties of orange peels<q>rub some orange peels on your skin gently if you have oily skin . oily skin responds well to application of orange peels . it helps balance the skin 's oil and makes your skin smoother and softer .<q>dried orange peel beads can act as a natural exfoliator by removing dead cells and blackheads gently and naturally .<q>orange peels help in removing dark spots and blemishes .<q>due to its cleansing , anti inflammatory , antibacterial and antifungal properties , it works well against pimples and acne .<q>to remove damp or musky odor from your house and fill it with a beautiful fragrance , boil a few peels in water ( you may also add some clove or cinnamon . )<q>cooking with orange peels<q>if you use organic peels in cooking the orange zest can enhance the taste and flavor of many dishes .<q>dried orange peels can absorb humidity from brown sugar . just place half a peel in the bag .<q>candy made with orange peels can improve your appetite and the vitamin c in them boosts your immune system . although the sugar content in most candy weakens the immune system , choosing candy made with orange peels is a better choice if you can not resist eating sweets .<q>banana peels<q>like oranges , make sure you use organic banana peels to reduce your exposure to pesticide levels and you may even want to try the wash described above anyways .<q>banana peels are full of antioxidants , minerals , and vitamins , so they can naturally cure many ailments and can aid cell regeneration . here are just a few uses .

http://www.autowerksofamerica.com/ - repacking a porsche wheel bearing might be easier than you think . we do n't have a recommended interval for repacking a porsche wheel bearing set but you will have to go through this procedure when you replace the front rotors . what you see here will work for many porsches from the 1990 's and earlier . the exception is all-wheel-drive vehicles . porsches built after 1999 will be similar , with some variation .<q>after removing the wheels and brake pads on your porsche the next step is to remove the dust cap . after removing the dust cap you 'll see the locking nut . align the slot in the hub so that you 'll be able to loosen the set screw to remove the nut .<q>remove the brake caliper , taking care not to damage the brake fluid line . hang the rotor on something sturdy like a suspension component , using a wire hanger or a bungee cord .<q>when you repack a porsche wheel bearing it 's easier of you use some kind of tool like the handy packer , available different places online . and use the proper bearing grease . clean the bearing surfaces on the hub and insert the inner wheel bearing and its seal . put the hub on the spindle along with the outer bearing .<q>note : when replacing the inner porsche wheel bearing there 's a seal that you 'll need to replace . so be prepared to have a set on hand , one for each wheel .<q>after putting on the thrust washer , tighten down the locking nut . to verify that you have the proper tension you can simply use a screwdriver and push against the thrust washer . there should be a slight bit of movement .
join us for a do it yourself budget meal in europe as we head to the spar grocery store in budapest , hungary to load up on local groceries including hungarian wine , cheese , deli meats , produce and chocolates for an indoor picnic in our apartment in budapest .<q>one of the ways we save money while traveling in europe is staying at airbnb apartment rentals where we have a full kitchen and an opportunity to buy cheap local groceries which we can cook and prepare at home to save money on restaurant meals . honestly , reducing restaurant meals allows you to save money almost more than anything else while traveling in europe .<q>i think you 'll find that our platter looked rather appealing with its variety of ingredients and to top it off with a glass of local egri bikaver red wine and some chocolate with coconut really made our day .<q>do you like to prepare meals at home ? what do you think is a good idea in terms of a cheap and delicious meal you can eat at your apartment while on the road ?<q>gear we use<q>olympus om-d e-m5 ii : http://amzn.to/1ochs7t<q>canon g7x : http://amzn.to/1ydjsyx<q>olympus 14-150mm ii lens : http://amzn.to/1y79zem<q>rode video mic go : http://amzn.to/1wdktvm<q>joby gorilla pod : http://amzn.to/1pgoy5f<q>sandisk 16gb extreme pro : http://amzn.to/25keers<q>social media & travel blogs<q>audrey :<q>blog : http://thatbackpacker.com/<q>instagram : https://www.instagram.com/thatbackpacker/<q>facebook : https://www.facebook.com/thatbackpacker<q>twitter : https://twitter.com/thatbackpacker<q>samuel :<q>blog : http://nomadicsamuel.com/<q>facebook : https://www.facebook.com/nomadicsamuel<q>twitter : https://twitter.com/nomadicsamuel<q>instagram : https://www.instagram.com/nomadicsamuel/<q>do it yourself budget meal in europe | indoor picnic in our apartment in budapest , hungary travel food video transcript :<q>well good afternoon . today we are trying something a little different . so often times we eat out . we love going to restaurants . yeah . and trying new food .<q>but we figured we should probably showcase more of like a budget friendly meal for travelers in europe .<q>yeah , so to be perfectly honest most of the time we are preparing our own meals in our airbnb . yes . and that is how we save money . that is basically what allows us to stay on the road . we have budget meals , we eat locally . we have like local deli meats and cheeses especially if we 're in europe .<q>we got to the markets and get fresh produce . stuff like that . so we 're just going to maybe take you on a little tour to the grocery store . yes . and then back into the kitchen and then on to our couch as we have basically . it is basically an indoor picnic . indoor picnic . haha .<q>let 's go shopping .<q>also , this is our apartment . we still need to make an apartment tour . but for now let 's focus on grocery shopping .<q>our supermarket of choice was closed . we were so excited to show you guys but it is in a really cool building too . it really is .<q>so you 're missing out . we 're missing out . on to the next spar .<q>this is our backup spar . it is much smaller and the vegetable selection is n't quite as impressive . but in we go . spar .<q>look at all the cheese . all the cheese . you know you 're in europe when there is cheese . wonderful cheese selection .<q>there is plenty of salami here in hungary . yeah , if you like meat and cheese you will not go hungry in this country . believe me .<q>and so i 'm going to start off with some wine . i 'll show you the stuff that i bought .<q>um , this stuff is pretty good . it is the egri bikaver .<q>we have sliced cheese , blue cheese , cucumber slices , tomato slices .<q>we have stuffed olives .<q>and this was a special one that we have n't tried yet . so i think this is it is a stuffed pepper .<q>i think with ricotta cheese and apples .<q>so that is a wrap for our indoor picnic . i think we 're both pretty stuffed .<q>yeah . that was pretty good . it looks like a small light meal but honestly it is pretty filling . especially when you tack on dessert .<q>yeah , with the wine and dessert that ended up being definitely a meal . definitely a meal more than a snack and yeah that was awesome . yeah . it was just nice to be able to eat at home and to have nice variety of food like that .<q>o there is a lot of ways you can be creative to save money while you 're in europe . and definitely the biggest budget tip we have is to have quite a few of your meals at home because yes whenever you go to a restaurant you always pay a lot of money .<q>this is part of our travel in hungary video series showcasing hungarian food , hungarian culture and hungarian cuisine .<q>this is part of our travel in europe video series showcasing european food , european culture and european cuisine .<q>music in this video courtesy of kevin macleod ( https://incompetech.com/ )<q>licensed under creative commons : by attribution 3.0

if your snowboard boot liners are heat moldable and you want to do it at home , we 'll show you how : you 'll use rice , a microwave , a short two-by-four , and several pairs of socks . shop rei 's selection of snowboard boots at http://www.rei.com/c/snowboard-boots .<q>transcript :<q>the most basic boot liners mold to your feet as you ride , while others can be heat molded for an immediate custom fit . if your liners are custom moldable and you want to do it at home , here 's what you 'll need : three to four pounds of uncooked rice , microwave , a short 2x4 , a couple old socks you can cut up , a pair of long , thin tube socks , and your thin wool or synthetic snowboard socks .<q>start by filling the long , thin tube socks with rice and tying a knot in the ends . put a bit more rice in one sock than the other . make sure the rice fills the socks uniformly so they do n't get hot spots , and microwave them . use this chart to determine how long to leave them in the microwave . remove the foot bed from your liner and replace your liner in your boot . keep your boot loose to make it easy to insert the rice sock . when the socks are ready , pick up the more full sock by the knot and place it in the liner . make sure the boot is very loose and tap it on the heel and the toe until the rice has fully filled the foot section of the liner . then close the cup and place the other sock in the top . lightly tighten the boot to keep the liner even . leave the rice in the liner for ten minutes .<q>while you 're waiting , you can cut the toe off the two old socks . wearing these as extra padding will help expand the toe area of your boot for some extra wiggle room . put the toe cap socks over your toes and pull your snowboard socks on . make sure they are smooth and wrinkle-free . to keep your legs in a natural position , you 'll want to wear both boots during this process , even if you 're only molding one boot at a time .<q>after ten minutes , remove the rice and put the foot bed back in the liner . then place the liner into the shell , step into the boot , and loosely tighten it . make sure to keep it far looser than when you actually ride to avoid overcompressing the foam . step onto the 2x4 with your knees bent and your feet shoulder width apart , and lean forward gently . the board will help you naturally flex the boot . after ten minutes of molding , the liner will have cooled enough that you can take it off and repeat the process on the other side . to recap , microwave the uncooked rice inside the tube sock . add the rice and let it heat your liner for ten minutes . prepare your socks and put on your other boot . step in and flex the boot for ten minutes .

hey guys , here i show you how to put on and install a zagg invisible shield glass screen protector for your iphone 6 or 6s plus<q>here 's an amazon link for iphone 6/6s + : https://amzn.to/2myuv46<q>and for the iphone 6/6s : https://amzn.to/2lbd9hq<q>zagg offers very easy installation with their easy to use tabs and yellow coloring which helps with aligning and actually seeing the screen protector . they also offer a lifetime warranty which means they have you covered for the life of your device . the screen is super smooth and very thin . as you can see , once i apply the tempered glass screen protector , it automatically adhered and sticked on by itself .<q>make sure you guys read the instructions for your screen protector for proper installation . and remember to make sure there are no lint , dirt , or any particles on the screen . use that microfiber cloth wipe off those particles . it might take some time , but patience is key for great result .<q>overall i like the feel of the thin glass . it does n't add much weight to the phone and feels more close and natural to the phone . while tempered glass screen protectors offer great front impact protection , it wo n't prevent your phone from shattering the screen . i highly recommend using a case that is designed for absorbing shocks in combination with a glass screen protector .<q>if this video was helpful , please like and subscribe for more !<q>thanks for watching<q>-- fire frost tech<q>www.firefrosttech.com

elon has a phobia about artificial intelligence , but i 'm not sure it 's warranted . neither are bill gates or mark zuckerberg . / / get updates like these in your inbox -- https://teslanomics.co/join<q>today we 're going to explore elon 's fear of ai wiping out the human race and why many others are less worried . to understand why elon is so fearful of ai , we first need to know what ai is . in computers , artificial intelligence is the field of work that involves creating programs that can mimic human intelligence such as playing chess and solving algebra problems .<q>while today we think of these examples as obvious tasks that a computer can perform with exceedingly good skill , when the field of ai research started at dartmouth college in 1956 , these were astonishing feats . some of the founders at this time were so excited about the field of ai that they proclaimed " machines will be capable , within twenty years , of doing any work a man can do "<q>that was in the early 60 's , not exactly the decade we think of when it comes to the computer revolution . in fact computers were barely a thing back then and mostly focused on processing complex equations which awesomely led to the calculus needed to later in the decade put a man on the moon . think about that for a second ... in this era , a 5mb hard drive , barely enough to hold a couple of photos by today 's standards , had to be hauled onto a freight container and lifted by heavy machinery . and today , i have 64gb in a piece of plastic the size of my fingernail . that 's nearly a 13,000 x improvement in about 60 years .<q>so was this the first time we as humans used ai to help us achieve something ?<q>by today 's standards many would say no , but if you zoom out a bit , you could argue that the computers used in the 60 's were merely imitating human intelligence , just faster and more accurately .<q>so if we think of artificial intelligence as simulating human intelligence , why is it such a hot topic lately with all of our leaders weighing in ?<q>well , we 've come a long way since the 60 's , and along the way , we invented the internet . this was the moment when a lot of those early science fiction visions of a world where the machines took over started to become a bit more real . with the internet , computer systems , and machinery could be controlled remotely . as well , data could be transferred leading towards significant innovations in artificial intelligence with the practice of machine learning .<q>the idea that we could teach a computer how to learn on its own , given a little instruction , has lead to many of the recent advancements fueling the ai hype cycle . no longer just an advanced calculator , ai systems are beating people at jeopardy , translating hundreds of languages instantly , and soon will be able to get us home safe after a night out with friends . so far what i 've described is a class of ai called narrow intelligence , or weak ai .<q>artificial narrow intelligence is when the system is focused on a specific task . all of the examples we 've seen so far fall into this category , although ibm 's watson is pushing the boundary a bit with its ability to understand a multitude of topics . so far so good , nothing to be afraid of , and plenty to be excited about . so why is elon so worried ?<q>it has to do with the next level of ai , artificial general intelligence . this is where ai systems will be able to reason , plan , understand complex ideas , and find solutions for problems quickly by learning from experience . this is where things can get a bit scary . if you 've seen the scifi movie ex machina you 'll remember ava , a human-like android that is generally intelligent . she was able to trick her guest into helping her escape . and if that was n't enough , the real threat to our existence is the highest level , artificial super intelligence .<q>leading ai thinker nick bostrom defines artificial super intelligence as " an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field , including scientific creativity , general wisdom , and social skills . " this is why elon and others such as stephen hawking and ray kurzweil are so concerned .<q>so yeah , it could happen , and we should all be a little worried . but honestly at the rate , it 's pretty far off before we could even imagine creating an artificially super intelligent system , i mean ... siri ca n't play songs from spotify , so we have a long way to go .<q>/ / new here ? check out more<q>most recent video - https://goo.gl/k3pwlt<q>most popular video - https://goo.gl/jydacr<q>subscribe - https://goo.gl/tpdo7v<q>/ / want to support the show ?<q>join us on patreon ! https://teslanomics.co/patreon<q>/ / shoot me a msg online<q>fb https://fb.com/teslanomics<q>tw https://twitter.com/teslanomicsco<q>/ / my gear<q>books https://kit.co/teslanomicsco/books-i-ve-actually-read<q>tech https://kit.co/teslanomicsco/tech-gear<q>camera - https://kit.co/teslanomicsco/camera-gear

i had so much fun creating this valentine 's day wreath .<q>i cut my mesh at 11 inches , the glitter fabric at 10 inches and the ribbons at 15 inches .<q>i hot glued the pink hearts to the mesh and attached the " love " pick with pipe clearners .<q>mesh : walmart - christmas clearance around 1.50 for the 2 pack<q>fabric : walmart - christmas clearance around 1.50<q>ribbon : pink heart from dollar tree 1.00<q>black stripe from michaels 3.99<q>sheer heart from michaels 3.99<q>black and white from michaels 1.99<q>picks : pink glitter hearts from dollar tree ( i detached the heart from the stick )<q>love pick from hobby lobby 2.99<q>18 " wreath from from walmart<q>red/white/pink pipe cleaner from dollar tree ( i only used the red )<q>i felt that this wreath was missing something . so , added a wooden sign that i found at wal-mart ( about $ 3 ) . the wreath had a satin ribbon hanger on the back , i cut the ribbon in half and tied the ends to the frame . i put up a pic in the video profile .

i was looking for something like this and did n't find it so here you go . i used some aluminium stays from an old backpack because it was free but any piece of stiff metal will do . make sure top and bottom edges where you cut are smoothed out or cover with tape as you will scratch yourself digging around in your bag . i took the bracket off because i did n't like the space they created . you may need this space so check clearances use nylock nuts and keep you bags off your pipes . do n't buy sae bolts if you ride metric ( talking about the bottom bolt ) it is a good idea to have the bolt size something common on your bile as it makes all repairs easier and especially on the road<q>hope this helps .

the best way to sit at a computer terminal - optimizing your energy !<q>brought to you by christina foch - certified physiotherapist , rn , bsc<q>key points<q>rsi risks of not sitting correctly<q>- neck strain<q>- eye strain<q>- shoulder pain<q>- lower back pain<q>- upper back pain<q>- poor breathing patterns<q>- weak abdominals / poor digestion<q>- carpal tunnel syndrome<q>- vericose veins<q>- poor circulation - cold extremities<q>- fatigue to body from overusing muscles that are compensating underused muscles<q>consider this<q>- proper posture at your workstation is a preventative tool to reducing strain and pain in the body . it 's in your own interest to sit properly . when the body is in balance , it does not overuse energy which keeps your energy levels up . the body , when in balanced alignment , looks slimmer and more confident . just by sitting up straight , your abdominal muscles are being used . this is the best workout you can do without the sweat and travel to the gym ! this is a no cost , time efficient way to improve your self image and prevent future aches and pains to your body . if you are already in pain or strain , this change will help you on your way to an overall reduction of stress to your body .<q>instructions for optimal sitting at a computer workstation<q>- feet are flat on floor and hip width apart<q>- keep a fist distance between back of knee and seat to allow for blood flow and circulation ( hint - if standing in front of chair , knees should be just above seat level )<q>- knees are in line with hips as much as possible - crossing legs or sitting more to one side impacts the distribution of weight and can cut off balanced circulation .<q>- hips are equal to or just slightly higher than knees<q>- shoulders are over hips with a natural curve in the back ( ergonomic seats have good lower back support ) - the better your spine is in neutral , the more open your lungs are to breathe and the more active your abs are to support balance in the body<q>- your spine roots down from the waist into a softness in the seat and lenghtens up from the waist at the same time . this creates length in the spine and optimum conditions for the nervous system running through the spine<q>- ears are over shoulders . this reduces neck and shoulder strain and can help ward off possible arthritis in the neck<q>keyboard and computer screen guidelines<q>- arms are by sides and a bent at a 90-120 degree angle .<q>- the elbows are higher than the wrists and the wrists are higher than the hands . this , again , follows the principle of circulation ( tip - think of a garden hose when you bend it and how it affects water flow ; now bend your elbows and wrists and realize that this principle applies to you too ! - keep the flow open and easy )<q>- have an arms length between you and the screen . this is optimal for sight distance<q>- your eyes should line up somewhere between the centre and top of screen . you do not want to adjust your head up or down to see the screen . this will cause neck and shoulder strain and may cause arthritis to the cervical spine over time . ( tip - your chin is parallel to the floor )

a demonstration of the verizon mifi - the portable wireless hotspot that uses the cellular network to create a wifi bubble around the unit for up to 5 devices to share internet access simultaneously .<q>this handy little device is manufactured by novatel and currently offered by verizon and sprint . mifi is a great way to bring broadband with you on the move and share broadband with several devices . the device is either battery powered ( about 4 hours of use ) , powered by a usb connection or the included ac charger . i have connected mac and windows laptops as well as iphones and ipod touches - everything worked great . connection speeds vary based on the your coverage area and the demand for wireless data , but i typically get 1.1 mbps down and about 500kbps up . there are a couple catches that buyers should be aware of . the largest wireless data plan available is $ 59/mo but that only include 5gb of data transfer per month - steep overage charges apply beyond the 5gb limit . in addition , you need to sign a 2 year contract for the data plan in order to get the device at a discounted rate .<q>overall , i 'm very impressed by the device . 4 of 5 stars .
please see my website here : http://www.brettsnaturalhealth.com<q>please subscribe here : https://tinyurl.com/y9v8n466<q>this video shows you how to avoid having to do an enema or colonic . when you cleanse your body it is often necessary to wash out your large intestine ( enema or colonic ) so you do n't feel toxic . this can be very helpful but the less you have to do , the better . one thing you can do to reduce the number of enemas you have to do is to consume psyllium husks and bentonite clay in a shake . some of the best cleansing products are from arise and shine . http://www.ariseandshine.com/ when you buy a cleansing kit you will get the psyllium , bentonite clay , herbal nutrition , chomper , probiotics , shaker bottle and instructions . it 's best to do the psyllium - bentonite shake in the morning when your stomach in empty . use good filtered water and drink it immediately for easy digestion . the fiber in the psyllium helps to keep the food moving through the bowel . ( please remember to squat for bowel movements . this is the natural way . ) psyllium helps to absorbe mucoid plaque ( undigested food matter ) and move it out through the bowel . this is helpful for keeping toxins out of the blood . the herbal formulas provided in the kit are helpful for preventing constipation . do n't do too much chomper herb though as it may cause diarrhea - the cascara sagrada is a laxitive . drink plenty of water during cleansing too . if you get nausia it may be parasites being stired up by the herbs . vomit using water with baking soda if you need to . the psyllium will help you to have regular bowel movements and prevent back up and feeling sick to your stomach . good luck and happy cleansing ! -----------------------------
we added a new family member and her name is poki-hontas . she is an african pygmy hedgehog which are domesticated and commonly bred and sold as pets . hedgehogs are very prickly but cute at the same time . we bought her from a very experienced breeder which had handled her properly and socialized her ( beach bum hedgehogs ) she has such a great temperament and is seriously the most precious thing ever . i just love playing with her and watching her play . nimbus still ca n't decide if she is family or food . oh silly doggie ! its illegal to own hedgehogs as pets is couple of the states in america so just make sure to do your research first :) i did get pricked couple times playing with her so i would n't suggest getting a hedgehog if you have small kids .<q>if you want to see more of ` poki ' make sure to ` like ' this video .<q>and thanking for watching !!!

https://www.facebook.com/pages/latest-news/101615183364879<q>https://twitter.com/__latestnews__<q>traders return to the nairobi shopping centre to find jewellery and mobile phones missing and cash tills plundered .<q>shop owners at the westgate mall in nairobi have been returning to their stores after last week 's terrorist attack to find displays ransacked and valuables stolen .<q>they say jewellery and mobile phones have been taken , cash tills plundered and restaurants emptied of alcohol .<q>shopkeepers believe troops sent in to protect the complex are to blame , although they admit they have no proof .<q>one witness told the associated press he saw a kenyan soldier take cigarettes out of a dead man 's pocket .<q>owners spent monday removing merchandise and other valuables from their stores and restaurants to prevent any more thefts .<q>soon after the attack began on september 21 , officials put a cordon around the mall , allowing only security forces and a few government personnel to pass through .<q>one business owner said money and mobile phones were taken from bags and purses left behind in the mayhem .<q>employees of a book shop on the second floor returned to find cash registers yanked open and cash gone .<q>the store 's laptops were also stolen , although none of the books were touched , said owner paku tsavani .<q>it is the second time in two months that kenyan security forces have been accused of robbery after an emergency .<q>there were also reports of looting during a huge fire at nairobi 's main airport in august .<q>acknowledging the westgate thefts , interior minister joseph ole lenku promised : " those responsible for looting will be prosecuted . "<q>meanwhile , kenyan intelligence officials are to be questioned by the country 's mps about whether they had advance warning of the attack .<q>almost no details have been released about what happened immediately after the terrorists moved in .<q>mr lenku has declined to give any information about them , saying : " we do not discuss intelligence matters in public . "<q>nine suspects are now in custody following the assault , which is thought to have been carried out by the islamist somali group al shabaab .<q>kenyan police assisted by us , israeli and european experts are still examining the shopping centre , which was extensively damaged .<q>the red cross says 39 people are still missing , although the government insists everyone is accounted for .<q>at least 50 kenyans were killed in the raid , along with six britons and citizens of france , china , ghana , canada , australia , south africa , peru and the netherlands .<q>a candlelit vigil was held for the dead at a makeshift memorial near the mall just before sunset on sunday .<q>the attack , which al shabaab claims was in retaliation for kenyan military operations in somalia , ended after a four-day siege by security forces .<q>five of the attackers were killed .

intex pool 12 x 24 pool assembly<q>some notes :<q>when the pool is in the get ready to pour water in it stages go around and pull all the bottom of the supports to keep the tension on one leg verses the other legs so go around and do it about 3 times that will give you an idea of were the support boards should go . so if you look at about 2.25 in the video the inside top poles are bent in . this is because there is not much water in it so after you have about 6 to 10 inches of water in it go in the pool slide around to get the wrinkles out of the bottom . then go around as your filling it and figure about 8 inches of distance each way is when you should start digging and putting in your support boards if the pool is more that 1 foot high on water it will be harder to lift and dig and put the boards under . so plan early . my boards were 2x6 s and i use 2 of them about 18 inches long . oh and the tarp that intex gives you will devolve by the sun in 1 summer . bottom tarps are cheap but cheap is cheap right !<q>oh i do n't recommend diatomaceous earth use a good sand for your sand filter check the instructions and do n't fill it with too much sand about 1 inch lower than recommend will get you through a good summers . back wash it every other day for 1 to 2 minutes use<q>good luck enjoy your pool any other questions i will be happy to answer .

no knead multi seed healthy bread , super easy , super tasty .<q>no knead bread recipe is so insanely brilliant -- no sticky fingers , no doughy mess , no intricate measuring , no complicated kneading . totally hands-off .<q>seeds are packed with minerals , vitamins , healthy fat ( mono and poly unsaturated fat ) , dietary proteins , anti oxidants , soluble fibers . . so its been proved that seeds when consumed as part of healthy diet can help us to maintain a healthy heart , a powerful immune system in our body and to have a strong musculoskeletal system .<q>so let 's make a tasty bread which can include all the goodness of seeds ( sesame seeds , pumpkin seeds , flax seeds , sunflower seeds ) as well as oats .<q>here is the recipe to make a healthy , multiseed bread .<q>it requires no kneading . it uses no special , equipment or techniques . and it takes very little effort .<q>ingredients<q>200 ml warm milk ( + / _ 1 tablespoon )<q>1tsp active dried yeast<q>3 tablespoon sugar<q>312 gms ( 2 and half cups ) all purpose flour .<q>you can also add whole wheat flour in this recipe .100 percent whole wheat flour bread will not be very soft as it contain less gluten.i have tried with 1/3 rd part of flour with whole wheat flour and they came out equally tasty as this bread , but the texture of the bread will be a bit denser than this bread .<q>milk powder 2 tablespoons ( optional . . but this can give a nice aroma and texture to our bread )<q>1 egg ( you can substitute this with 1/4 cup yogurt )<q>1 tsp salt<q>50 gms butter<q>2 tablespoons of sesame seeds , pumpkin seeds , sunflower seeds , and oats.grind 1 tablespoon of flax seeds which will be approximately 2 tablespoons of powdered flaxseeds .<q>method :<q>step 1<q>prepare the dough .<q>1 . activate the dried yeast .<q>pour 200 ml warm milk into a bowl and sprinkle over the yeast and sugar . stir well until sugar and yeast get dissolved .<q>2 . measure the dry ingredients : flour , milk powder and salt<q>3 . combine the wet and dry ingredients and then add butter.as this is a no knead bread we need our dough to be more on sticky side.sso you can add 1or 2 tablespoons of milk accordingly .<q>step 2<q>first proofing<q>wrap it with a plastic film and keep it aside in a warm environment ( for 6-8 hours ) for the first proofing .<q>go for an overnight proofing if you want to bake it in the morning .<q>after six hours , degas the fermented dough and then pull and stretch the dough .<q>step 3<q>shape the dough .<q>transfer it into a baking vessel .<q>step4<q>second proofing for 60 minutes .<q>cover the pan with cling film make the dough rest for the second proofing .<q>approximately after 1 hour the dough will get doubled in size .<q>step 5<q>bake the bread .<q>bake at 400 degree f for 35-40 minutes .<q>you will get a beautifully caramelized golden brown crusted loaf of nutrition packed multiseed bread.i like soft crust ... so i smeared it with lil butter to make the crust more soft .<q>turn the bread out onto a wire rack and leave to cool for 10-15 mins before slicing .<q>the inside of the bread will be very soft , airy and so moistened.i hope you will try this recipe and i am sure your whole family would love this bread .<q>enjoy baking no knead bread in your kitchen .<q>banana walnut cake recipe : https://youtu.be/jbzpxukpwgw<q>easy no knead focaccia bread : https://youtu.be/mahnxcwzely

http://bestmoviesevernews.com/holidayshop/ stuffed animals are adorable , huggable , and definitely cuddly . however , more often than not , that 's all they can do : look adorable and cuddly . now , with sidekix , you have cute and huggable stuffed animals that can be kicked , zipped , flipped , clipped , or even stuck on walls or any other object out there ! you get two toys in one package : they are stuffed animals , and they can be attached anywhere for decorative purposes as well ! right now , the available sidekix varieties include the panda bamboo , the dog mojo , the chick click a dee chik a dee , the red dinosaur inferno , and the zebra savannah .<q>so how does sidekix work ? if you flip the sidekix toy inside out , the animal form will be revealed , and that is what you can cuddle and squeeze to your heart 's content , as you would a normal plush toy or stuffed animal . aside from simply hugging them and cuddling with them , you can also kick and throw them around like a ball . just sip them into a ball and you 're off ! you can also zip them to transform your sidekix to emerge to and from the ball . the ease in zipping it up is because of the custom made zipper pull that is used in the design of sidekix .<q>the decorative function of sidekix toys can also be utilized by simply clipping them to your backpack , bag , a bookshelf , or practically anything you want to clip them to . you can even clip them on your belt loop or back pocket ! this is easily done through the included plastic clip which you can attach on the animal itself , or to the ball when it is zipped . many bike users would also like to have their sidekix keep them company during their long bike rides . there are magnets that are inserted into the limbs of the sidekix , which makes it easier to stick them on any metallic surface . you can even stick them on the door of a refrigerator !

http://www.thecompletedrummer.com/2012/07/09/how-to-use-the-metronome/<q>this video drum lesson demonstrates different ways for using the metronome in your practice routines . when you play along with the metronome pounding every beat in to your head , it creates a sort of dependence on the click . it makes it into a crutch . instead , try spreading the metronome clicks out . have it only beat once per measure . or once every two measures . this makes you responsible for keeping time and you can test yourself to see if you stay locked in with the metronome .<q>turning the volume of the metronome down is another good exercise . since you cover up the sound of the metronome when you play with it , you 'll still hear it if you 're not together . this will actually make it easier to tell if you 're with it . happy drumming !

" this was the start of a tough story to tell - and - even though pickles was n't dead when bella got to her , there was definitely something wrong - she was dying , it was pretty clear . so bella just held her sweet little friend in her hands and breathed with her a few last breaths , and then it was over - pickles the hamster was dead .<q>bella was shocked and kind of paralyzed and did n't know what to do - so she finally put pickles back in her cage , told her mom " pickles is dead " and then it all hit her and she burst into tears and could n't stop crying , just letting it all out . her new pet , her beloved hamster died .<q>at school everyone tried to cheer her up , but it did n't really work - she just spent the day crying . they had a little funeral for pickles , and bella 's friends wrote notes , and they buried her in a little shoe box in their backyard . it was really sad and upsetting for bella , for a long time .<q>after some time , she decided she could and should go to the pet store and get a new pet hamster - another sweet , tiny , adorable , fluffy , little one that she named buttercup . but buttercup was n't a replacement , and bella will always remember her first real pet , pickles ! animals give us great stories , especially our pets .<q>see kids video - storybooth 's other losing a pet story : https://youtu.be/9ktevjvdcas<q>links :<q>website : http://www.storybooth.com<q>instagram : @thestorybooth<q>twitter @thestorybooth<q>https://www.instagram.com/thestorybooth<q>g + : https://plus.google.com/+storybooth/v ...<q>facebook : https://www.facebook.com/storybooth-1 ...<q>if you liked this storybooth animation and love storytime / story time kid videos , watch our themed playlist collections :<q>being yourself :<q>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pltv86vy0aucvmy5pzxawy9vbciradqgh7<q>love and heartbreak :<q>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pltv86vy0auctnxgvveztfysmopevzw0t4<q>embarrassing and funny :<q>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pltv86vy0auctczlwmli-dbolr3zgxfvcf<q>bullies and mean people :<q>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pltv86vy0aucuvzfrile3wncqhw1jztxiw<q>overcoming challenges :<q>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pltv86vy0aucuzwxs4wrqcb2kvxt_xa5od<q>and watch other great videos like mean mom , embarrassing period story , running away from boys , anxiety and who am i.<q>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrdeqsv370a<q>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgnynvw4vcs<q>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6zuk1d5lga<q>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjw0ppbkmvu

government corruption - 11 year-old girl charged with crime for wearing too much perfume in schools . inn texas , children as young as 6-years-old have been charged with crimes for such things in school .<q>daily news @ http://revolutionnews.us -- ( austin , tx ) if you disrupted class or used profanity back in school , you were probably sent to the principal 's office . today in texas , more students are being sent to criminal court instead .<q>last february a student at fulmore middle school says she received a ticket for " disruption of class " after spraying perfume on herself .<q>" i did n't do anything wrong , " said 13-year-old sarah , who was in the sixth grade at the time she was ticketed . " i thought i did n't smell good and the next thing you know , the whole class complains for no reason . "<q>sarah said her teacher took her out of class and told an officer assigned to the school that she was being disruptive . sarah said that she had been the victim of bullying by some of the same students since the second grade .<q>the ticket carried the weight of a class c misdemeanor and called for a $ 150 fine . sarah 's attorney said the tickets are common in texas and believes they send the wrong message .<q>" we 're basically criminalizing school discipline , " said kady simkins of advocacy inc. " things that you or i would have been sent to the principal 's office for , a child may receive a ticket for , and they end up in the criminal justice system very , very young . "<q>sarah 's mother could not understand why the officer would have written a ticket , since he was not in sarah 's class when the alleged disruption occurred .<q>" i think it 's wrong , " said sarah 's mother , jennifer . " if you do n't see it , how could you say she disturbed a class ? "<q>ticketing in texas has been around for more than two decades . a rise in school violence in texas in the mid-1990s convinced lawmakers to get tougher on school crime , and it may have , in turn , led to more tickets since .<q>according to texas appleseed , an austin-based non-profit law foundation , officers wrote more than 275,000 class c misdemeanor tickets to students in 2009 . some of those students were as young as six .<q>the majority of the tickets were for bad behavior in school . police wrote the most in houston , followed by dallas , san antonio , brownsville and austin . they came with a fine of $ 50 to $ 500 , required students and a guardian to appear in municipal court , and could stay on a student 's record in to adulthood .<q>they could also impact that student 's chances of getting into college . a uniform application now commonly used in texas asks if they have ever been convicted of a misdemeanor , felony , or other crime . to that , more students must now answer " yes . "<q>" all of the evidence that looks at really ` get tough ' measures for kids finds that they are totally counterproductive , " said texas appleseed director deborah fowler . " they do n't work , they lead to poor outcomes , and they are a waste of our resources . "<q>others disagree . captain eric mendez of aisd police believes the tickets have a place . he would not comment on sarah 's case , however he did say that times have changed .<q>" our officers need to have the same abilities in a school setting as you would out in the community . " capt. mendez said . " just because you 're inside the four walls of a school does n't mean that the laws change . an assault is still and assault and possession of marijuana is still possession of marijuana . "<q>still , texas appleseed would like to see a minimum age for tickets set to 14 . there is support within the capitol for new laws .<q>" i do n't believe i 'd go the ticket route , " said sen. john whitmire ( d ) houston . " i do n't think we are dealing with criminal justice problems ; they are school problems . "<q>as for sarah 's case , she will soon go before a jury of six adults . they will decide the punishment for an act her mother believes an educator should have handled .<q>" i feel like the teacher should have just stopped it right then and there , " said sarah 's mother , jennifer . " she could have asked the other students to stop harassing sarah , asked sarah to give her the perfume , and just let it go from there . "<q>sarah said the whole episode has left her feeling " embarrassed , " as she prepares for her day in court .<q>--<q>" whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it , and to institute new government ...

the humble can opener might seem like an obvious invention today , but it took 50 years from the tin can 's invention to the very first can opener . before then a hungry person had to use whatever tools were available , from bayonets to rocks . over the last 150 years there have been hundreds of attempts to improve and perfect it . some more successful than others . in this episode of make : inventions , steve hoefer goes through the creation and construction of three different designs . then he put them to use to see which -- if any -- are an improvement on the bayonet or a rock . read all about it on make : http://blog.makezine.com/2013/06/13/make-inventions-can-openers/

typewriters in working condition are becoming increasingly difficult to find , especially with a low double-digit price tag . i was thoroughly surprised when i was browsing a familiar auction site and came across this typewriter with not so much as scratch , scuff , or ding to its exterior . finding information , let alone a manual , for this typewriter was like trying to find a needle in a haystack ; the only working link i found lead me to an italian version of the manual . all in all , however , i 'm quite impressed with this typewriter 's durability and performance . not only does it have a tabulator functionality similar to an electronic typewriter , but you can use a ribbon with up to four different colors . best of all , replacement ribbons are still being sold for it !

http://danoday.com/restaurants advertising your restaurant on radio can be very profitable if you know exactly how to write your commercial . radio advertising expert dan o'day offers a crash course for every restaurant owner .<q>identify the core message of your restaurant 's radio commercial . by core message , i mean what is the one key point that you want the listener to hear , to understand , and to remember ? too many commercials either do n't have a core message ... or they have more than one . and more than one core message is one too many for your listeners .<q>this one principle will be difficult for you to adopt at first -- but it 's crucial to your success . you 're going to want to mention as many different selling points of your restaurant as you can squeeze into the commercial : various menu items , the hours you 're open , how long you 've been in business , your phone number and your address and your website , your monthly " international night , " senior citizens ' specials ... and be sure to ask about our vegetarian menu .<q>wrong .<q>identify the one thing that you want the listener to hear , to understand , and to remember . and then say it again and again and again and again . hopefully you say it in a way that attracts the attention of your target audience . you might say it amusingly , although that 's not necessary . what 's important is that you say it compellingly -- in a manner that is likely to be heard , remembered , and acted upon .<q>radio advertising is all about painting pictures in the listener 's mind . make sure you 're painting the right pictures .<q>use the language that real people use -- not the language used by radio announcers and advertising people ! have them act and respond as real people do .<q>here 's how i would describe my favorite chinese restaurant to a friend :<q>" it 's my favorite restaurant in los angeles . it 's west hollywood , i 've been going there for 20 years , and the food is terrific . if you like shrimp , you have to order their crackerjack shrimp . and their walnut chicken with red sauce -- i could eat that every day of the week . oh , and start with their shrimp toast . it 's so good that there 's no way it can be good for you , so just enjoy it and feel guilty later . "<q>you know what i would not say ? " they have a wide variety of traditional chinese dishes , cooked to perfection with only the finest fresh ingredients . and there 's something on the menu for everyone in your family ... "

here 's a great video on how to fix your walls with stucco . this was the first time i have ever done this . remember to 1st spray the existing walls with water before you begin , concrete or stucco will not adhere to each other without a little water , you do n't want a lot , just mist it well . make small batches if your doing a large area , i made four separate layers for this patch . all this material can be rinsed with water after you are finished , just do n't use water in the mix . after each batch i made i rinsed the bucket and cleaned the tools otherwise the stucco mix will harden . good luck and remember you have around a 30 minute work time before it starts to set and hardens in around two hours . ps . i remembered one more thing , before i laid on the stucco i took a hand-held grinding machine with a 6 inch concrete wheel and cut in a bunch of lines for the stucco to grip to , not sure i needed to do this but i did . wear a mask if you do this , lots of nasty dust !

the military transport association ( mta ) is the northern new jersey based affiliate of the military vehicle preservation association ( mvpa ) . we are a historic military vehicle collectors club . the town of paterson , nj contacted our organization and asked if we were able to move an m-60 battle tank from its display base on garret mountain , passaic county park in paterson to the towns veterans memorial park , three miles away . after investigating what was involved and getting the proper clearances from the us army a few of our members , with a lot of resources , executed the move on 10/9/2010 . this is the story as shown on local news . to say the least this was an unprecedented achievement done by volunteers . no military or governmental entities assisted with the physical relocation . this was done by civilians who donated their time , knowledge and equipment . the old location was rather secluded . the vietnam era tank is now in a place of honor . it will be seen and appreciated by more people .

video # 386 : how to make straight clean holes in your polymer clay beads , using a hand held metal twist drill bit . by cindy lietz , polymer clay tutor : http://www.beadsandbeading.com/blog/?p=17074<q>topics covered in this video :<q>* in a previous video i showed you how to put holes in polymer clay beads . here is the link ... http://www.beadsandbeading.com/blog/how-to-pierce-holes-in-polymer-clay-beads/17049/<q>* in this video i will show you how to make the holes bigger in your baked polymer clay beads , should you need them to be larger .<q>* wait until you need to use your beads before drilling the holes larger .<q>* you can always make the holes bigger but it is difficult to make them smaller .<q>* i prefer to drill my beads by hand . it is safer than a power drill or dremel , and it is easier to make a nice clean hole in your bead ... especially with round beads .<q>* i use a double ended pin vice with a small drill bit ( about the size of a 20g wire ) on one end , and a larger bit ( about 12g ) on the other . i also have a tapered burr bit ( from my dremel set ) , that i have put into an old exacto blade holder .<q>* start by enlarging the holes slightly with the tapered bit , just enough that your drill bit will enter the pilot hole cleanly .<q>* drill beads by hand , going halfway from one end , then turning the bead around and going through from the other end . this makes for a nice clean hole from both sides .<q>* if you do n't have a tapered burr bit , you need to start with the smallest bit you have and go through each size up until you get to the sized hole that you need . do n't try to go straight to a larger bit , or you will risk chipping the edges of the hole .<q>* follow these tips and you will have professional looking holes in your beads , at whatever size you need .<q>* if you enjoyed this video , please do click the like button . subscribe too ... for lots more entertaining and educational videos every week !

not a bmw cafe racer video , but hopefully a little more impressive ... this is my dads project . its a ride on train track , i cant remember exactly when he started this , however there is an unfinished steam loco in the shed somewhere that i remember him working on when i was pretty little ... the current train itself is a baldwin 242 locomotive , and number 762 works number from lynton and barnstable southern railways and you got a preview of that in part 9 video of the cafe racer build at about 3 minutes in . i will give you a walk around the train one day when its a bit more together.anyway . i managed to persuade my dad to allow my to put this video on utube because to be honest i think its just to good not to share ... hope you like it ... if you do have a look at the later video with the electric train in it , definitely worth a peek ...

thanks for your recent purchase of our raindrip drought buster kit . this kit helps you convert your pop up spray head to a drip irrigation system , saving up to 70 % water compared to a traditional sprinkler system . this kit is designed to help water your flowers , shrubs or trees and should n't be used to water your turf area . installation of this kit should take about 20 minutes . let 's get started<q>before beginning installation , make sure you do the following :<q>1 . ensure your sprinkler system is turned off or not scheduled to turn on during the installation of the drought buster kit .<q>2 . choose the spray head you want to replace . for the most effective watering , we recommend you select a centrally located spray head to maximize the amount of plants you can water .<q>you are now ready to begin installation .<q>first , clear the dirt around the spray head you want to replace .<q>once the area is clear , unscrew the spray head and body .<q>in order to ensure your manifold does not get clogged , we recommend you flush out your system to remove any debris that might be stuck in the pipes . to do this , simply turn your sprinkler system on until you see a bubble of water clearing out the lines .<q>after you flush out your system , screw in the sprinkler riser . you may need to cut the riser to the desired height . the top of the sprinkler riser should be tall enough to leave room for the drip manifold to be close to or just above grade .<q>once the riser is installed , it 's time to attach the manifold . simply thread the manifold onto the top of the riser , ensuring it is on tightly . then , cover the area around the riser with the displaced dirt .<q>now it 's time to install the tubing .<q>pull the end of the tubing from the roll and measure from the base of your plant to the drip manifold . cut the tubing .<q>next , insert the tubing onto the barbed connector on the drip manifold .<q>once inserted onto the connector , run the tubing to the base of the plant . place the end of the tubing into the 1/4 " tubing stake , and place the stake into the ground .<q>the drip manifold has eight connectors in total to ensure all of your flowers , shrubs and trees are covered . repeat this step for all ports . if you will not be using some of the ports , turn the blue button in a clockwise direction to turn the port off<q>you can use the surrounding mulch or dirt to cover up the drip tubing .<q>once all of the tubing is in place , it is now time to turn on your system .<q>use a coin or similar sized , rounded object to turn the blue knobs to the desired flow rate . this drip manifold is adjustable with flow rates from zero to 30 gallons per hour . the flow rate you need will depend on the size of the plant , soil , amount of sunlight exposure and run time of your system . click here to view a general guideline on flow rates for different applications .<q>so that 's all there is to it ; if you still have questions , you can reach us at raindrip@raindrip.com and we can help you out with any additional questions you may have .<q>for more than 30 years , raindrip , inc.

everyone has nose hair . especially those people whose nose hairs protrude from their noses . so can we all just get rid of them already ? in this episode of dermtv , dr. schultz discusses what nose hairs actually do and whether or not you can remove them .<q>subscribe to dermtv :<q>http://www.youtube.com/dermtvdotcom<q>http://dermtv.com<q>connect with dermtv :<q>http://www.facebook.com/dermtv<q>http://www.twitter.com/dermtv<q>[ transcript ]<q>nose hairs . everyone has them . no one wants them . but should you remove them ? or should you let them grow ... and braid them ! stay tuned for a surprising answer .<q>do n't worry ! braiding them is n't the solution . but seriously , what should or can you do about them ?<q>that really depends on how " germ phobic " you are . but here 's the twist . they do n't cause germs , they actually help to protect you from germs .<q>your body is very smart and has a complex system to help protect you from getting an infection from breathing in germs , like viruses , bacteria and even fungi . your first line of defense for germs breathed in through your nose is the mucous in your nose and ... yep ... those annoying hairs . the mucus and hairs both help to catch the germs by acting like a filter . so the hairs do have a real and theoretically important function , and i say theoretically because , if you had all the hairs in the part of your nose near its opening removed ... in other words ... the ones that can show ... i personally doubt your immunity would be seriously compromised because they represent such a small part of your complex immune system . so despite those hairs having a real purpose , when they do grow long enough to be visible , most people that i know prefer to get rid of them , instead of flaunting them as their personal anti germ warfare weapons .<q>so to control these embarrassing hairs , it 's ok to trim them but do n't pluck them out because the germs inside your nose can invade the damaged skin and cause an infection . and as you 've heard me say many times , plucking any hair can set you up for ingrowns which in the nose are really a problem . so trimming carefully with a scissors , making sure you do n't cut yourself , is ok as are the " personal devices " advertised in magazines that trim them with less chance of cutting yourself . and if you want to get rid of them permanently , since the roots are often fairly close to the surface of your nose , they can often be removed by laser hair removal which of course is permanent and safe even for nose hairs .<q>do n't worry , the laser is n't put inside your nose , it works from the outside .<q>[ about dermtv ]<q>everyone can have beautiful , healthy , and younger looking skin , and dermtv , the internet 's daily skincare video show , will demonstrate how by revealing expert tips and techniques and by providing real solutions for real skincare issues .<q>skincare ( whether cosmetic or medical ) previously required a trip to your dermatologist or a shopping spree at the pharmacy . and that 's if you have a trusted nearby dermatologist or a local informed pharmacy . but not anymore . we at dermtv are committed to making best-in-class dermatology and skincare guidance accessible to everyone , anytime , at your computer .<q>every weekday , our host , dr. neal schultz , one of new york 's most trusted and respected dermatologists ( see bio below ) , teaches skincare 's most timely and timeless issues . topics include : the best at home techniques and new technology for facial rejuvenation , preventing and fixing sun damage from wrinkles to skin cancer , breaking news in dermatology , general skincare topics , and more .

watch more how to raise farm animals videos : http://www.howcast.com/videos/346178-how-to-build-a-chicken-coop<q>a chicken coop provides shelter for your chickens and gives them a place where they can lay their eggs . this coop comfortably fits 4 chickens .<q>step 1 : build a base<q>build a 6-by-3-foot base for the coop by constructing a frame . screw 2 3-foot 2-by-4 boards across the ends of 2 parallel 8-foot 2-by-4s , about a foot in from the ends .<q>tip<q>mount the outside roost to the support on the front wall , attaching the other end to the hen house frame .<q>step 2 : build frame for the side walls<q>construct a frame for the side wall by screwing 2 4-foot 2-by-2s perpendicularly to the ends of the base frame , a foot in from the front and back . screw in a third 4-foot 2-by-2 between the first 2 , 4 feet behind the front post . now screw a 6-foot 2-by-2 across the tops of the posts to finish off the wall . build another identical frame for the opposite wall of the coop .<q>step 3 : build front and back wall<q>construct a front and back wall by screwing 3-foot 2-by-2s across the tops of both side walls , at the front and back . screw another 3-foot 2-by-2 across the center of the front wall ; this will be the outside roost support .<q>step 4 : wire the walls<q>wrap and staple chicken wire to the front wall , as well as to the front 4-foot sections of the side walls .<q>step 5 : build hen house<q>at the same height that you attached the roost support to the front wall , construct a square frame within the unwired , back area of the coop by screwing 3-foot 2-by-2s across the insides of the rear upright boards , and across the insides of the upright boards that will frame the front wall of the hen house . screw 2-foot 2-by-2s across the insides of the 2 unwired side walls , in line with the other boards you just attached .<q>tip<q>if you need to make the coop larger , consider how many chickens you plan to house . a good method is to add 3 to 6 square feet per chicken .<q>step 6 : make the hen house floor and ceiling<q>use the plywood to make a floor for the hen house across the square frame , screwing the plywood to the frame . construct an identical rectangular ring of boards at the top of the upright 2-by-2s -- this will support the roof of the hen house .<q>step 7 : construct the interior<q>build a nesting box using the remaining plywood ; the box should about 1 cubic foot . leave the front side open , and place the box so that the open side faces and rests up against one wall of the hen house . at a raised level , mount a 2-by-2 or piece of scrap wood across the center of the hen house to serve as an indoor roost .<q>step 8 : make a door for the coop<q>use the circular saw to cut a piece of siding to completely cover the wall opposite the nesting box . cut the section in half vertically , then make another vertical cut 1 1/2 inches in from the edges of each half to make a hinge line on each side .<q>step 9 : attach the door<q>screw 2 hinges across the left hinge line and 2 across the right hinge line , about 5 inches from the bottoms and tops of the doors . on the back of the right door , screw a door catch to the inside edge , shorter than the length of the door , so that it sticks out about an inch . screw the double doors to the coop frame ; on the top and bottom of the right door , attach barrel bolts , screwing the bolt catches to the frame .<q>step 10 : make egg door<q>cut a piece of siding to fit the wall adjacent to the nesting box . make cuts for a rectangular egg door in the middle of the siding , starting 8 inches in from each side and 4 inches from the top . remove the door piece , flip the doorframe over , and screw door catches around the inside edges of the door hole so that they stick out about 1/2 inch<q>step 11 : attach the egg door<q>replace the door piece in the hole and screw 2 hinges across the hinge line on one side of the door . then screw a barrel bolt onto the other side of the door , attaching the bolt catch to the door panel . screw the egg door wall to the coop frame .<q>step 12 : build an entrance and ramp<q>cut and attach to the frame a piece of siding to fit the back wall , running from the ground to the roof . cut a section of siding to cover the wall facing the open-air area of the coop . cut a square-foot hole to serve as an entrance into the hen house . using extra plywood or scrap wood , attach a ramp that will run from the entrance to the ground .<q>step 13 : put on the roof<q>wire and staple the top of the coop , as well as the area underneath the hen house without siding . attach the plastic roofing over the hen house , making sure you place it at a slant so that water will run off toward the back . you 'll be eating fresh eggs for breakfast in no time !<q>did you know ?<q>modern chickens are believed to have descended from the red jungle fowl of southeast asia .

i have always noticed people being scared of styling prints together and they often end up wearing a gorgeous printed piece with a solid color garment and that too in either black or white . i love mixing prints and i wanted to bring you all the few tips and pointers , or sort of a style guide i follow while mixing prints so that it always looks good and not too messy/busy . i hope you enjoy the video !<q>xoxo ,<q>srish<q>look 1 :<q>trousers/shoes - zara<q>shirt/hoop earrings - h & m<q>look 2 :<q>skirt/top/hoops - h & m<q>shoes - asos<q>look 3 :<q>skirt/t-shirt dress - zara<q>belt - forever new<q>shoes - forever 21<q>earrings - h & m<q>look 4 :<q>trousers/blazer/earrings / cuff - h & m<q>sports bra - adidas<q>shoes - asos<q>look 5 :<q>dress/skirt/earrings / cuff - h & m<q>shoes - asos<q>look 6 :<q>jumpsuit - forever 21<q>crop top - genes by lecoanet hemant<q>earrings/cuff - h & m<q>shoes - asos<q>look 7 :<q>dress - asos<q>top/earrings/cuff - h & m<q>shoes - zara<q>subscribe . rate . comment :)<q>website | http://stylefashionetc.com<q>follow us !<q>style fashion etc facebook | https://www.facebook.com/sfebysrish<q>twitter | https://twitter.com/stylefashionetc<q>instagram | http://instagram.com/stylefashionetc
i take a submarines shower . i turn on the water wet my entire body turn the water off i then scrub my body then i rinse . i usually use maybe 2 gallons of water when i shower .<q>my plan is to carry 6 shirts 6 underwear 3 shorts and 6 socks . you can take spray bottle showers and get clean that way . i can wash in the shower or out at a camp site as long as i have water . i have a 2.5 gallon jug painted black that is good enough to heat water for washing . i need to get a 2nd bottle and paint it black i might just paint this bucket black but if i have 6 gallons i should be able to shower wash clothes and keep ahead of the game .<q>3 sets for me means 3 days i change shirts mid day i do n't like to have dirty clothes on me i sweat up a shirt i will take it off get a face cloth wipe down apply fresh deodorant maybe a body spray and get a fresh shirt .<q>there are ways you can wash on the run you use a larger 5 gallon bucket and you put some tennis balls in the wash drive for an hour they will get plenty clean . change water to rinse again ride another hour and spin dry hang your clothes in the car with the wind flowing through your car . that is if you want to do this on the go . let the car do your work if you can ? in the gym i would have to get them started to soak , store the bucket in the locker , go do my walk , return to my car with the bucket empty of water and spin dry outside return to the gym rinse and shower . return to car spin hang to dry . do n't have to hang to dry in the parking lot you can go hang them some place else or if you want you can go to a laundry toss in the dryer and you are ready to roll if you have your clothes washed when you get to the laundry you are ahead of everybody else you will get the jump on them becasue you will grab a dryer when everyone else is needing a washing machine . saw a guy that went to laundry and all machines were taken he had to wait . i bet he spent a lot more time waiting . if he had washed in the gym he would be ready to dry and out of there less than 30 min .<q>when i worked construction i would soak my shirt in ice water after i cleaned it i worked in incredible heat the black top came from the plant over 300 degrees that heat rose and it just took it all out of you .

voa news for friday , january 13th , 2017<q>thanks to http://gandalf.ddo.jp/ for audio and text<q>from washington , this is voa news . i 'm david deforest reporting .<q>a kremlin spokesman expressed concern thursday about the arrival of u.s. soldiers and tanks in poland . he said the arrival of u.s. forces is a threat to russian security .<q>the first contingent of u.s. soldiers arrived in poland from germany thursday .<q>eventually the u.s. plans to station more than 3,000 soldiers in poland .<q>the mission , dubbed the atlantic resolve , will see troops , tanks and military vehicles , rotate between poland and several other nearby nato countries , including estonia , latvia , lithuania , romania , bulgaria and [ hungaria ] hungary , rather .<q>the deployment was ordered by the obama administration in 2014 as a response to russian aggression in ukraine .<q>united nations head antónio guterres joined leaders from several european countries in geneva thursday trying to resolve the decades-long political crisis in cyprus .<q>he , along with representatives from cyprus , greece , turkey and britain , gathered in an effort to hammer out an accord that would create a united two-zone federation .<q>the united states military released details thursday about a joint operation in afghanistan last november that resulted in the deaths of 33 civilians .<q>residents and taliban insurgents say the attack on the village of boz in kunduz province flattened dozens of houses . in addition to the deaths , twenty-seven people were wounded .<q>general john nicholson , commander of u.s. forces in afghanistan , says he deeply regrets the loss of innocent life .<q>former secretary-general of the united nations ban ki-moon arrived back home in south korea on thursday amid mounting speculation that he may run for president .<q>ban was greeted by thousands of supporters at incheon airport near seoul .<q>this is voa news .<q>the united nations envoy for syria , staffan de mistura , said thursday that the cease-fire there is largely holding although there have been some exceptions .<q>opposition forces say there has been an increase in government airstrikes .<q>de mistura says a cutoff of water to the syrian capital , damascus , threatens to derail peace talks scheduled for later this month in kazakhstan .<q>the government of gambian president yahya jammeh is asking the supreme court to block the inauguration of his successor , adama barrow .<q>mr. jammeh is refusing to accept his loss at the polls last december and is asking for the results to be thrown out .<q>israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said thursday that the upcoming paris peace conference is " rigged " against his nation and that he will not be bound by anything it decides .<q>the conference beginning january 15 may endorse a framework for peace between israel and the palestinians .<q>french president françois hollande says the conference is intended to cement international support for a two-state solution in the middle east .<q>u.s. president-elect donald trump 's choices to lead the department of defense and central intelligence agency distanced themselves from the incoming president by advocating a tough approach toward russia .<q>the statements came thursday during testimony at congressional confirmation hearings .<q>cia nominee mike pompeo said russian interference in the 2016 u.s. presidential election was ordered by russian leaders .<q>" this was an aggressive action taken by the senior leadership inside of russia . and america has an obligation , and the cia is part of that obligation , to protect that information . "<q>defense department nominee general james mattis told the senate armed services committee that the post-war balance of power is being threatened more than ever by russia .<q>" i would consider the principal threats to start with russia , and it would certainly include any nations that are looking to intimidate nations around the periphery , regional nations nearby them . "<q>also thursday , the senate passed a waiver that would allow mattis to run the pentagon despite his [ active ] recent active military service .<q>neurosurgeon ben carson testified before the senate banking committee concerning his appointment to the department of housing and urban development .<q>director of national intelligence james clapper has told president-elect donald trump that the u.s. intelligence community did not create a document purporting to contain scandalous information about trump obtained by the russians .<q>clapper says he told the president-elect the intelligence community has not made any judgment that the information is reliable .<q>in washington , i 'm david deforest .<q>that 's the latest world news from voa .
this laptop would not turn on . often total electronic failures like a completely dead unit are easier to fix than if the computer only partially worked . the problem with this laptop was the broken connection behind the plug jack . it must have been yanked . to fix it i had to take it totally apart . it took just under 2 hours for me to complete it but i had no video guide to follow and i had never seen it done . so you should be able to do it much faster . if your laptop has no signs of power be sure that it is not just your ac adapter that is bad . i have a video on fixing that too . you should get a multimeter if you are going to work on electronics . even walmart sells them for under $ 10 . if you have questions just ask ! good luck !

looking for a nice hot pepper ? the kind that is easy to grow and will burn off any facial hair you may have once had ? the red demon hot pepper comes pretty close to that !<q>these seeds came in a pack with the orange fogo pepper seeds i 've already reviewed the plant for . i can honestly say that i feel the red demon pepper is much hotter by far ! both are quite nice looking plants but i would say this variety enjoys a larger container and a more regular water supply . these two plants had the same soil & watering schedule but the plant on the left gets about 2 hours more direct sunlight than the one on the right does . i would recommend 8 hours of direct light for best results or perhaps a light shade near the midday point would help a bit ...<q>as far as heat goes , this is the hottest pepper i have tasted so far in the collection and my rating of a 6 was soon increased to 8 once the after burn started to set in . lucky for me i planned ahead and brought milk . remember that if you will try this at home . milk is good here , water ... not so much .<q>thanks for taking a look at the red demon peppers here in the pepper collector playlist , please feel free to check out some of the other varieties i have on the grow ! have a wonderful day !<q>some of our other channels .<q>blondco entertainment : https://www.youtube.com/channel/uchfa3vab91vpzcwi3oyaj9w<q>jts bearfoot outdoor adventures : https://www.youtube.com/channel/uc5ovbztge-eo6ghpmxjihca<q>bear inthekitchen : https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucnkw8kvcxbeaddt2vixkyqw<q>clean valley farms : https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucs2njgrbkkbp1a5a9gdv99g<q>or why not check out the blogs ?<q>talk-qua-ponics - http://jtbearstalkquaponics.blogspot.ca/<q>bearfoot outdoors - http://bearfootoutdoors.blogspot.ca/<q>grumblingtumblingbear - http://grumblingtumblingbear.blogspot.ca/<q>mrbearslibrary - http://mrbearslibrary.blogspot.ca/

where i order supplies when in the u.s - https://shop.bombingscience.com/graffiti-paint/brands/belton-molotow-paint?acc=2f2b265625d76a6704b08093c652fd79<q>i realize the steps to painting a mural could have sounded a bit confusing when using the grid technique , here it is in steps ...<q>step 1 - have your sketch and wall be the same measurement in relation to each other . ( if the wall is a square , then your sketch or photo better also be a square )<q>step 2 - download the grid app and get your sketch gridded . i like to have multiple grids but this is entirely up to you and the amount of specificity you would like .<q>step 3 - on your wall , measure the length or width in order to be able to divide it by the number of boxes on the same side of your grid . if you have a 100ft . wall and your grid is has 10 boxes on each side , divide 100 by 10 . this will give you the size of a single box/grid , which is crucial . i have also done it so that if i do n't measure the whole length of the building , i find a measurement on the building that i can use to give me an indication of size . this could be from window to window , floor to floor etc. .<q>step 4 - i cut a piece of cardboard , wood etc. that corresponds with the length of the grid ( or half of it ) and carry that with me as i make my marks on the wall . you can use charcoal or chalk for these lines in you want them wiped away easily .<q>step 5 - i use a level on my wood and almost always begin on the length side of the building and go across horizontally . i keep my level straight and only add marks to the edges . i find there is no need for the full lines . i personally will add smaller squares within the grid in the most detailed areas and will use different marks when doing so .<q>step 6 - think of yourself as a typewriter ... always coming back to the original side you started on ( left or right does n't matter but you have to stick with it ! ) and getting all your grid marks on . i usually just do the large ones and add smaller grids as i progress on the piece .<q>step 7 - draw your outline or just start painting ! always making sure to check your reference to see if you are in the right place .<q>find me here :<q>website - https://davidpopaart.com<q>facebook - https://www.facebook.com/davidpopaart/<q>instagram - https://www.instagram.com/david_popa_ ...<q>contact me - davidpopa4@gmail.com

thanks for watching !!! what an amazing baby deer encounter !!!!! i 've listed a few facts and things you should know when it come to newborn fawn encounters .<q>baby deer are born april through july , with the majority of fawns born in june . first-year does have only one baby each , with twins in the following years or even triplets ...<q>baby deer/fawns are left alone most of the day while their mothers go off to feed and chase other mature deer away . they typical stay 100/150 yards away and come back 2 or 3 time a day to feed , clean and move the fawn . if you can know of any other reasons please leave a comment .<q>baby deer/fawns are typically left in tall grass fields , thick woodlands , and thick brush but sometimes you can find them in open areas , including backyards .<q>well-meaning people often think that because a fawn is alone it must be an orphan ... not true most of the time !<q>a fawn has it 's best chance of survival when left in the wild ... even if the fawn was abandoned because the mother was killed ... other does in the area can and will adopt the baby deer ... i 've seen as many as 4 with one doe . personal i think it 's best to leave the fawn alone .<q>now ... as far as touching the fawn ... a lot of people say do n't do it !!! because you 'll leave your sent on them and make them easy targets for predators ... well . . let 's talk about that ... it true you will leave your scent on the fawn but it 's a human scent . the reason baby deer are born without a deer smell is deer smells tasty to predators !!!! this is also another reason why the doe leave the fawn . typically human scent does not smell like a meal to most fawn predators . exceptions : maybe the grizzle , wolf , mountain lions ... if you can think of any others please leave a comment . so i would say ... it depends on where you live whether or not you can touch one .<q>one of the most important things to remember is not to feed , water or spend to much time with the fawn ... imprinting is likely going on and we run the risk of interrupt that vital process .<q>tell me what you think of the video . thanks<q>subscribe<q>https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucd7oajhltlwfw6ehheierka?sub_confirmation=1<q>other videos<q>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-yxxpuzqxw<q>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucd8kj_kpku<q>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faoklt5r6c0

http://www.drenergysaver.com | 1-888-225-6260<q>in this home , dr. energy saver replaced the old oil furnace with an energy-efficient propane heat pump . the heat pump is so efficient at extracting all the heat out of the combustion gases and distributing heated air throughout the house , that the exhaust vents can be run through pvc pipes to the outside of the house , rather than through the masonry chimney . this upgrade has made the masonry chimney no longer necessary . larry janesky , owner and founder of dr. energy saver , also walks us through the process of sealing this unused chimney .<q>the old , low-efficiency gas water heater , which was also exhausted through the masonry chimney , was replaced by an energy-efficient tankless water heater . the tankless water heater also exhausts trough pvc pipes to the outside .<q>these upgrades rendered the home 's existing chimney useless . masonry chimneys , even when in use , are huge sources of energy waste . they are basically an unsealed , hollow column that runs from the bottom of your home all the way to the roof . heat is being transferred to the brick walls , and the air you pay to heat is leaking through gaps in the column , and between the roof and the masonry walls .<q>the upper part of the masonry chimney was taken down to the attic floor . in the future , the homeowner will be able to take down the part that runs through the living space , if he wishes to have additional living space . the top of the chimney , now down to just below the attic floor , was then closed using rigid foam board insulation , and air sealed with spray foam . the gap left on the roof was sealed and shingled .<q>the new heating system will now work at top efficiency , because the heated air will stay where it belongs -- in the living areas of the house . the home will be more comfortable and this homeowner will save a lot of money in his energy bills .<q>to learn about many ways to save money and energy at home , look for other on the job videos on our website , or call a dr. energy saver expert for a complete home energy audit !
general hospital january 25th , 2006<q>at the courthouse , john fights for a postponement to manny 's trial but the judge sides with alexis , and allows manny to attend in a wheelchair .<q>at gh , liz treats manny . in character , ( and referring to her by her first name ) he compliments her kindness and expresses his desire to be " friends " -- you can almost see liz ' skin crawl at the thought . lorenzo shows up and , after liz leaves , reminds manny he is to rid the world of sonny and jason or else he , lorenzo , will turn over samantha 's memory chip . later , lorenzo invites a very willing skye to fly to manhattan with him .<q>at home , samantha awakens from a nightmare in which outside the courtroom , a just-acquitted manny has risen from his wheelchair and cornered her . urged by jason to try to forget about him as john will likely postpone the trial , justus arrives with bad news -- there will be no postponement ! the two head to the courthouse , where alexis and john each give strong closing arguments that point to the lack of evidence ( of manny 's new personality ) on the opposing sides . ultimately , he is found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and ordered to counseling , community service at gh and to wear an ankle monitor . samantha is shockingly calm at the verdict .<q>at the metro court , a very busy carly flies solo in jax ' absence ; she is on the phone trying to get sonny to pick up the kids from the hotel but sonny is apparently too busy . nikolas shows up wanting courtney 's whereabouts ; he 's convinced carly already gave them to jax . naturally , she refuses to help him -- though after some arguing , she does give him a phone number .

during the stay on the deserted pine island i had to fish for food . i only had my survival fishing gear with me . i could not find any natural bait on the island so i had to improvise and try to simulate nature in order to catch my meal .<q>since there was no bait to be found i used a torn up old piece of rubber worm on a small hook . lures are no good in this lake because of all the weeds . bait is useless if you have none so a line and bobber was out .<q>i let out a long bit of fishing line from my reel and tried to emulate an insect falling out of a tree . by swinging my pole backwards and then forwards again and letting the lure hit the water it looks to a fish as if an insect fell with a little splash .<q>then i let the hook slowly sink to the bottom of the lake before pulling it straight up again and re casting into the water .<q>i repeated this continuously until i had enough fish to eat . if this had been true survival i would have kept any sized fish for food . but i let a lot of smaller fish go to grow larger .<q>when fishing you have to remember that if you can see the fish , they can see you . you must sit very still and be quiet . fish do not want to be eaten . they are wary .<q>by splashing the hook on top of the water and letting it sink , it kicks in the predator instinct in the fish . the fish will compete for food and attack before they have a chance to smell or examine the bait . the fastest one gets the food . when you are bobber fishing the fish have time to examine what you have on the line and will most likely pass on it .<q>but fast action like what i am doing here causes the fish to hit first and think about it later .<q>i will later do another video using a cane pole and fake bait that i make using materials from nature .<q>then another video using only some fishing line , a hook and the rest all scavenged materials .<q>thanks for watching . please subscribe , like and share .<q>troy<q>tr tech tactical & survival
i made these fall off the bone ribs for my new neighbors . i usually do n't cook my bbq ribs to fall off the bone tenderness , but it seems that most people outside the world of bbq request ribs cooked that way . that being said , i do like a good fall off the bone rib myself . i smoked these ribs on my traeger grill , but any grill or smoker would work . i smoked these ribs for about 5 hours at 220 degrees , then foil wrapped them with bbq sauce and butter and smoked them for an additional hour . after the ribs were on the smoker for an hour , i drained the liquid from the foil packs and glazed the ribs with it . i did n't return the ribs to smoker since they were already at the point where they were fall off the bone tender .<q>i only got a small sample of these ribs , but the one neighbor i spoke with said that they werethe best bbq ribs ever .<q>check out traeger grills here : http://amzn.to/2y8mxn1<q>information on grill masters club<q>the grill masters club delivers the best rubs , sauces , spices , recipes , & grilling products to your door monthly !<q>we curate the best products from suppliers around the world and put them in a box and ship them to you .<q>join our community of 15k pitmasters , smokers , and bbq lovers .<q>happy grilling<q>this product was sent to me complimentary<q>the grill masters club : http://grillmastersclub.com/<q>facebook : https://www.facebook.com/grillmastersclub/<q>twitter : https://twitter.com/grillmastersvip<q>subscribe : https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucfeyemgrditzse2cpff2uog<q>facebook : https://www.facebook.com/nohippiebbq<q>https://www.facebook.com/lyle.whitlock<q>twitter : https://twitter.com/nohippiebbq<q>google + : https://plus.google.com/b/104776977338810471856/+nohippiebbqcooking/posts?pageid=104776977338810471856<q>video url : https://youtu.be/dryb1xpnooa<q>if you do n't have a smoker or grill , check this youtube video out by jenny can cook<q>fall-off-the-bone ribs - baby back bbq ribs - oven or grill<q>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rjygau7unq<q>disclaimer : this video and description contains amazon affiliate links , which means that if you click on one of the product links , i potentially can receive a small commission .

buy our meat cookbook : http://amzn.to/1bbpdde<q>buy the all-clad 12-inch skillet : https://amzn.to/2z9gazk<q>did n't think frying bacon could get any better ? we prove it can .<q>here 's a simple way how to make bacon that 's crisp and tender instead of dry and crumbly . make crispy bacon with no risk of overcooking . bacon cooked in water ? it works !<q>place the bacon ( in strips or cut into pieces ) and just enough water to cover it in a skillet over high heat . when the water reaches a boil , lower the heat to medium . once all of the water has simmered away , turn down the heat to medium-low and continue cooking until the bacon is crisp and well browned . when we tried this method , the meat plumped up as it cooked instead of shriveling , leaving the bacon pleasantly crisp yet moist , not tough or brittle .<q>the addition of water keeps the initial cooking temperature low and gentle , so the meat retains its moisture and stays tender . by the time the water reaches its boiling point ( 212 degrees ) , the bacon fat is almost completely rendered , so you 're also much less likely to burn the meat while waiting for the fat to cook off .<q>see this tip on cook 's illustrated : http://cooks.io/2lsvbvo<q>how to cure your own bacon at home : http://cooks.io/2lswgpm<q>watch : did you know you can cook steaks straight from the freezer ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulwseg1lmae<q>watch : genius tip on how to quickly defrost meat https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a2hqpj6dxc<q>each week , the cast of america 's test kitchen brings the recipes , testings , and tastings from cook 's illustrated magazine to life on our public television series . with more than 2 million viewers per episode , we are the most-watched cooking show on public television .<q>http://www.americastestkitchen.com<q>more than 1.3 million home cooks rely on cook 's illustrated and cook 's country magazines to provide trusted recipes that work , honest ratings of equipment and supermarket ingredients , and kitchen tips .<q>http://www.cooksillustrated.com<q>http://www.cookscountry.com<q>about us : located in boston 's seaport district in the historic innovation and design building , america 's test kitchen features 15,000 square feet of kitchen space including multiple photography and video studios . it is the home of cook 's illustrated magazine and cook 's country magazine and is the workday destination for more than 60 test cooks , editors , and cookware specialists . our mission is to test recipes over and over again until we understand how and why they work and until we arrive at the best version .<q>if you like us , follow us :<q>http://americastestkitchen.com<q>http://facebook.com/americastestkitchen<q>http://twitter.com/testkitchen<q>http://instagram.com/testkitchen<q>http://pinterest.com/testkitchen

same time , same general location<q>insulin is absorbed at different speeds depending on where you inject , so it 's best to consistently use the same part of the body for each of your daily injections . for example , do not inject your lunch bolus dose in the abdomen on monday and in the thigh on tuesday . if you have picked the thigh for your evening injection , then continue to use the thigh for all of your evening injections.according to eli lilly , the leading manufacturer of insulin , most insulin enters the blood :<q>fastest from the abdomen ( stomach )<q>a little slower from the arms<q>even slower from the legs<q>slowest from the buttocksrotate within an injection site<q>to avoid developing hard lumps and fat deposits , it is important to inject in different spots within a general part of the body .<q>change sides within an area . for example , if you inject your evening insulin in the thigh , try using the right thigh one evening , and the left thigh the next evening .<q>you might find it useful to picture the face of a clock on your abdomen . that helps you to keep each of your injections at least one finger 's width from the last injection .<q>let 's say that you inject four times a day , and all of the injections are in your abdomen . look down at your abdomen and picture " noon " below your belly button . place your first injection at noon , your second injection at 1 o'clock , the third injection at 2 o'clock , and the fourth injection at 3 o'clock . you will not come back to the " noon " spot again until day 4 , which gives that spot a chance to rest .

http://easysteps.work<q>cheap franchise opportunities .<q>cheap franchise opportunities from an expert for beginners .<q>today it 's a proven fact that there are many cheap franchise opportunities that interested individuals can do ,<q>but it is not always obvious that some of them may be fraudulent or unprofitable .<q>obviously cheap franchise opportunities are highly attractive to most people because of their low investment costs . they can also be found in many different industries .<q>nonetheless it is not enough to choose a particular industry - you need to evaluate your skills and background so that you can find a business franchise that you will be comfortable in doing .<q>the main advantage of cheap franchise opportunities is low cost of investment , typically you can find a cheap franchise deal between ten and fifty thousand cash . some are even less than ten thousand dollars .<q>but be careful , some franchisors offer cheap franchise opportunities because of a hidden problem in their company . in any case if you find an offer that sounds too good to be true , make sure you research the business very well to be certain of its credibility<q>by a rule of thumb if you 're looking for a franchise for $ 3,000 or less you would be wise to find an online franchise company that you can do from home .<q>there are n't many online business franchises around , many claim to be , but they are not actual franchises , they are just direct selling companies where you operate as an affiliate using the main business name and tools . one of the most well known is avon . the main advantage of an online business franchise compared to a traditional franchise such as subway or mcdonalds is that you do n't need physical premises to store goods or operate from .<q>plus you have your own business name and deal directly with your own customers online .<q>the franchise business i recommend is paul lynch 's dot com business franchise .<q>paul is vastly experienced in online business , having made millions online in the past 10 years .<q>here he is recently training his newest platinum franchise members . he has set up an amazing business with four levels to suit every budget and skill level .<q>this franchise system is completely set up as a done-for-you system and contains all the products paul has used to make over $ 3.2 million completely online . here is a current list of all the traffic generating products inside each franchise - facebook traffic hack , own the traffic , one penny per visitor , video views tsunami , youtube robot tsunami , pay per click tsunami and local marketing hack .<q>these lead magnets are being added to regularly . also included are all the done for you sales funnels for every product - squeeze pages , sales pages , sales videos , sales letters and follow up emails .<q>plus all the tracking . plus training in marketing online . the most amazing part of this 3 step system is the invaluable one on one training you get from experts to help you set your system up , then all you have to do is use the products to drive traffic and paul and his team then do all the selling for you .<q>you need never worry about generating leads and traffic ever again . all paul 's products are proven before being added to each franchise . to try this system for free , and see what value you get , just click on the link below the video or go to easysteps.work . e a s y s t e p s dot w o r k my name is sue tamani<q>http://easysteps.work<q>franchise examples ,<q>low cost franchise opportunities ,<q>franchise 2016 ,<q>franchise advantages and disadvantages ,<q>best franchises to own ,<q>franchise business for sale ,<q>how to start a franchise ,<q>online franchise ,<q>franchise cost ,<q>franchise model ,<q>owning a franchise ,<q>international franchise ,<q>top 10 franchises ,<q>how to buy a franchise ,<q>opening a franchise ,<q>list of franchises ,<q>franchise business opportunities ,<q>best franchise to buy ,<q>what is a franchise business ,<q>franchise ideas ,<q>franchise list ,<q>which franchise ,<q>franchising a business ,<q>franchise business model ,<q>best franchise to own ,<q>franchises to buy ,<q>business franchise for sale ,<q>best franchise business ,<q>franchise sales ,<q>own a franchise ,<q>franchise examples ,<q>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqii_pvhd3c<q>https://youtu.be/wwflxp6fun4
i bought my wife the empty child print on canvas from david pollot 's etsy store ( https://www.etsy.com/listing/220026110/doctor-who-gas-mask-are-you-my-mummy ) and decided i could save 70 $ if i mounted it myself on some diy gallery stretcher bars . the build process is similar to making a frame or box , the hard part was actually stretching the canvas on over the bars . i believe this was mostly because the canvas had already been conditions and printed on . if it was raw canvas , it would have been a little more forgiving , but the results were great anyway .<q>what you need :<q>a canvas print<q>some wood ( i used poplar , but pine would probably work too )<q>a way to cut the wood :)<q>wood glue : http://amzn.to/1k8o1ud<q>staple gun<q>ratchet straps ( http://amzn.to/1k8nxuj ) or band clamps ( http://amzn.to/1scdq46 )<q>subscribe to my channel on youtube : http://bit.ly/livefreeanddiy<q>want to support live free and diy ? get early viewing , exclusive content and more ...<q>http://patreon.com/livefreeanddiy<q>follow me :<q>instagram : https://instagram.com/livefreeanddiy<q>twitter : https://twitter.com/livefreeanddiy<q>facebook https://www.facebook.com/live-free-and-diy-1716322958603492/

( such as anti cellulite cream , hair loss remedy , etc. ) method one : the simple approach . this is the most common way of using the device - the vast majority of people use their roller in this manner .<q>using the roller with slight pressure ; roll the device back and forth four times in four directions as shown below . the treatment should not be painful and should not draw blood . you will become accustomed to how much pressure you can apply without causing any discomfort .<q>use the roller as part of your daily routine - you can roll every day if you wish although we recommend allowing your skin at least a couple of days of rest each week . it is possible to use the roller far less often and we suggest that fitting your sessions in with your daily and weekly routine will improve the overall experience . note that it is not necessary to roll more than once a day .<q>skin care after rolling : if you have followed method two , we recommend that after cleaning the area , you should apply an antibacterial cream to protect from any possible infection . ( it is unlikely this will happen but it is wise to take precautions . ) apply rejuveness scar cream or rejuveness ( claudio memory serum ) moisturizer after use . remember that part of the benefits of using your roller is the boost in absorption rates of topical products . nourishing your skin at this point can reap major benefits .<q>important safety info : * never share your derma roller with other people . * do not use a derma roller on areas of sunburn , open cuts or other sore and tender areas . * do not us your derma roller if you are suffering from active herpes outbreaks or any other inflammations of the skin . * you can contact us at any time if you have any questions . * we are not responsible for any unfavorable results which may be derived from improper use of this product .<q>possible side effects : your skin is likely to redden after use . this should fade within a few hours . in extreme cases , this may last for 24 hours . it is possible that you will experience dryness of skin after rolling . this can be accompanied with some flaking of the skin . if you do suffer in this way , stopping rolling should allow the skin to return to normal within a few days . please use common sense in these cases - reduce the frequency with which you use the roller and ensure you are using rejuveness scar cream or rejuveness ( claudio ) moisturizer after use .

michael : i 'm michael hyam with the business exchange and we are at the annual international franchise association convention in las vegas at the mgm grand . i have with me mr. joseph alder . joseph is a partner at hoffer adler law firm and i also understand general counsel for the canadian franchise association . i do have a question for you today and my question is , what are the legal aspects to consider when purchasing a franchise ?<q>joseph : okay , the first thing that you should consider as a perceptive franchisee is that you should have a very detailed look at the disclosure document with your franchise lawyer and account , as well , to look at the financial statements of the franchisor . that disclosure document should contain some very important information that will help guide you in terms of whether or not to purchase the franchise . for example , it may include very onus previsions in a franchise agreement or in another agreement which you may not want to sign or obliged yourself to or it may include some information regarding a number of terminated franchise agreements or franchisees that may sense some warning signals and the prospect may not want to buy that franchise for that very reason . included as well , in that disclosure document is some information regarding any litigation against the franchisor or its associates and generally you would get an understanding of the business that you 're buying and it 's very important to be in sync with the franchisor to make sure that that franchise is actually the one that would actually work for you because if it does n't work for you then i would recommend not to sign the agreement and oblige yourself to an agreement that could be upwards of 10 years or more . so with the guidance of a franchise lawyer and your accountants and financial advisors you will have a better understanding of the offering , have a better understanding of what 's involved in terms of an investment , whether you really have it within you to actually go ahead and operate this franchise . so i think that 's<q>really key to this whole business proposition and if you do want to proceed and you 're buying an existing franchise business then it 's also another transaction as well of an agreement of purchase in sale that needs to be worked out to make sure that you 've got all of the representations of warranties from the vendor . make sure that the business that 's being represented to you is in fact accurate in terms of how it 's represented and it 's a typical kind of asset purchase arrangement usually and sometimes it 's a<q>share purchase agreement so in essence there 's two parts to it there 's the disclosure end of it and then there 's the purchase of a business end to it and those two combine when you buy a franchise business .

samantha was surprised with the quality of this small dog carrier from wopet , but it is n't without its flaws . ideal for dogs weighing up to 16 pounds , this carrier claims to be airline compliant . it 's much cheaper than other similar products , but is it worth buying ?<q>you can find her extensive written review here :<q>http://topdogtips.com/wopet-soft-sided-small-dog-carrier-review<q>" it certainly is n't top of the line , but it 's well made and the stitching is durable . it has all the amenities of a more expensive dog carrier , but you can certainly see why it does n't cost as much . for example , it does come with a soft pad to keep your dog comfy while he 's inside the carrier , but it 's very thin and wo n't offer your fido any support .

on bbc 's victorian farm , alex langlands makes a salve to treat the shire horse 's sore hoof .<q>comfrey ( also comphrey ) is a common name for plants in the genus symphytum . its traditional names of knitbone , boneset and the derivation of its latin name symphytum ( from the greek symphis , meaning growing together of bones , and phyton , a plant ) , speak to its longstanding reputation as a therapeutic herb . comfrey species are important herbs in organic gardening . it is used as a fertilizer and as an herbal medicine . comfrey root contains allantoin , a urea hydantoin , which is reputed to promote cell proliferation . [ n.b. these details do not constitute a treatment recommendation . ] langlands heats the crushed roots in tallow , then melts beeswax into the mixture . allowed to set and cool , the salve will be added to the sore area .<q>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comfrey<q>http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/allantoin#section=related-substances

how to bathe your cat . while cats can be meticulous groomers , there are times when they really need a bath . sometimes they get into something very sticky or dirty . other times , they have a medical condition that requires regular bathing with medicated shampoo . despite this , most cats will react negatively to getting a bath , which can be stressful for both the cat and the owner . luckily , there are a few things you can do to make bath time less stressful for both parties , and this wikihow will show you how . brushing the cat will help remove any knots and tangles in the fur , which will be much more difficult and painful to remove once your cat is wet . if your kitty likes getting brushed , then you can use the brush to make the kitty feel more at home in the tub . [ 2 ] you can get kitty shampoo from your vet or local pet store . check the instructions to see if it 's right for your cat , and dilute it with water if necessary . using regular human shampoo can not only dry out your cat 's skin but can be toxic for your cat . do n't use dog shampoo in a pinch , either . you 're better off using water rather than a product that can harm your cat . [ 3 ] the first thing you should do is tire your kitty out , so they are at their most mellow before they enter the water . this will make them less likely to bite , scratch , or to try to get away . pick a time when your kitty is at their calmest -- often after they have been fed . if they still act hyper , play with them as much as you can until they are worn out . here are some other ways to get your kitty adjusted to the bath before you start bathing them :

learn how to make chocolate garnishes at home and decorate your favorite cakes in your style .<q>chocolate cake , chocolate pudding , chocolate pastry , cupcakes ... these sound so sinful and indulging . they look even more tempting when they are garnished in just the right way . chef shantanu gupte is up with this wonderful recipe of making delicious chocolate garnishes .<q>ingredients :<q>white compound chocolate<q>dark compound chocolate<q>plastic sheets ( ohp sheets )<q>parchment paper<q>method :<q>- melt both , the white chocolate and the dark chocolate for about 40 seconds in the microwave on medium heat .<q>- take a plastic ( ohp ) sheet and cut it into two halves .<q>- take a parchment paper and make a cone out of it .<q>- pour the white chocolate in the cone and fold the cone .<q>- cut the tip of the piping bag ( cone ) and start making designs of your choice on the plastic ( ohp ) sheets .<q>- we have used three sheets for three different designs . the number of sheets is your choice depending on how many garnishes you would like to make .<q>- then pour the melted dark chocolate over the plastic sheets on which you previously made designs with the melted white chocolate .<q>- take a palette knife and spread the dark chocolate evenly over the white chocolate and keep it aside for a few seconds to solidify .<q>- cut the sheets lengthwise and then into squares , making sure that you are not applying pressure on the knife while cutting the sheet so that the sheet does n't tear .<q>- if your sheet becomes too hard and you are unable to twist it , you may leave the sheet near an oven so that it gets a little heat and becomes soft enough to twist .<q>- take one of the sheets and roll it .<q>- then keep all the three sheets in the refrigerator for a couple of minutes so that they solidify and leave the sheet .<q>- remove the sheets out of the refrigerator and carefully separate the sheet from the chocolate .<q>- your chocolate garnishes are ready .<q>- you may store them in an air tight container for about 6 months and use them to garnish multiple dishes like cakes , puddings , etc. .<q>host : shantanu gupte<q>director : neha sarkar<q>camera : kawaldeep singh jangwal , manjeet kataria<q>editing : pratik jain<q>vfx : pratik jain<q>creative head : kavya krishnaswamy<q>producer : rajjat a. barjatya<q>copyrights : rajshri entertainment private limited<q>subscribe and get regular updates : http://www.youtube.com/user/getcurried?sub_confirmation=1<q>like us on facebook : https://www.facebook.com/getcurried<q>share on facebook - http://goo.gl/lehydy<q>tweet about this - http://goo.gl/fxlnqt<q>subscribe and get regular updates : http://bit.ly/subscribetogetcurried<q>https://www.facebook.com/getcurried<q>https://plus.google.com/+getcurried<q>https://twitter.com/get_curried<q>https://instagram.com/getcurried

to put on a saddle , always stand on the horse 's left side . it is an old tradition from the middle ages , so the knights would n't hurt their horse with their sword held on the left side . start by placing the numnah that protects the horse 's back and the withers , some horse more sensitive may need a shock absorber . here it is , and it goes on top of the numnah . and the saddle . make sure the stirrups are folded and that the girth is placed over the saddle . once the saddle is placed behind the shoulder blade , make sure that nothing is pinching the withers , by lifting the numnah a little bit . the saddle must n't be too in front or too far away on the horse 's back . bring the girth down and tighten a little for the moment , and once the horse has done a few steps , tighten more so the saddle does n't turn when the rider is about to get on the horse . there you go ! you now know how to put on a saddle !

combat bulletin 47 , produced by the signal corps ' army pictorial service in 1945 provides viewers with updates on the war . the film begins with the tokyo strikes in february 1945 , showing task force 58 heading to japan ( 01:18 ) , despite adverse weather conditions . planes take off and fly past mt. fuji ( 01:54 ) on their way to strafe japanese ships and attack japan 's aircraft factories ( 02:40 ) . the u.s. attack devastates some of japan 's most important engine and assembly plants ( 03:18 ) . the next segment shows u.s. forces swarming over iwo jima ( 04:15 ) , marching japanese prisoners to the stockade ( 04:50 ) and destroying japanese gun nests . a b-29 makes an emergency landing ( 05:50 ) . in " clean-up on corregidor , " u.s. troops are shown attacking japanese positions . troops of the 3rd battalion march past destruction ( 07:27 ) on their way to replace troops from the 1st battalion . patrols move along the beach at rock point ( 07:50 ) , and general douglas macarthur ( 08:26 ) arrives for the flag-raising ceremony . in china , u.s. forces overcome supply problems with the help of chinese men who walk along a river pulling supply boats upriver ( 09:51 ) . hand-drawn carts and mule-cart trains are used to transport fuel barrels . an american convoy is ferried across the luo river ( 11:22 ) , demonstrating the difficulty of penetrating the interior of china . in india-burma , u.s. troops build temporary shelters known as bashas ( 12:25 ) and use bamboo to construct beds , showers , tables , and chairs . in the u.s. the military tests the new t-26 heavy tank ( 13:48 ) , which features a new engine , track , and a 90 mm gun . general hodges and his staff inspect the delivery of a t-26 e3 on the front lines of the rhine . the final clips show viewers the u.s. offensive to take the rhine . the 3rd army marches ( 16:03 ) to the rhine ; the offensive begins in late february and is designed to collapse german control of the region . nazi prisoners ( 17:00 ) seek cover from german fire . the 1st army ( 17:28 ) moves to cologne , where soldiers remove resistance in the towns surrounding the city . general maurice rose leads the push into city . although the nazis barricaded the entrance to the city , u.s. troops and tank dozer quickly clear the barricade ( 19:28 ) . germans hold out in some buildings , but no house-to-house resistance faces the americans . the film reveals impressive footage of the fighting in the streets of cologne , including u.s. troops routing nazi snipers from their positions ( 20:55 ) . amazingly , the cathedral of cologne still stands ( 21:50 ) , having avoided any direct bomb hits . the 1st army captures bonn while the 9th division moves into bad godesberg ( 22:20 ) ; the americans capture the town on 8 march . bad godesberg is home to the rheinhotel ( 22:45 ) , where neville chamberlain and adolf hitler met prior to the munich conference in 1938 . u.s. troops arrive at the riverside town of remagen ( 22:52 ) and secure the bridge . this marks the first breach of the rhine river . the 9th army moves toward duesseldorf ( 24:14 ) , taking control of the rhine 's west bank . the 35th infantry division ( 25:10 ) meets up with british troops as allied forces continue their fight against nazi germany .<q>the m26 pershing ( referred to in the film as a t-26 ) was a heavy tank/medium tank named after general of the armies john j. pershing , who led the american expeditionary force in europe in world war i. it was briefly used in the final months of world war ii during the invasion of germany and extensively during the korean war . intended as a replacement of the m4 sherman , the prolonged time of development meant that only a small number saw combat in the european theater , most notably in the 9th armored division 's dramatic dash to take the ludendorff bridge during the battle of remagen . based on the criteria of firepower , mobility , and protection , r. p. hunnicutt ranked the pershing second , behind the german panther medium tank , but ahead of the tiger i heavy tank . in service during the korean war , the m26 outmatched the t-34-85 in terms of firepower and protection , but was challenged by the hilly and muddy terrain , and as a result was withdrawn in 1951 in favor of its improved derivative , the m46 patton , which had a considerably more powerful and reliable engine as well as an advanced and improved suspension to better meet the demands of the specific terrain it operated in . the lineage of the m26 continued with the m47 patton , and was reflected in the new designs of the later m48 patton and m60 patton .<q>this film is part of the periscope film llc archive , one of the largest historic military , transportation , and aviation stock footage collections in the usa . entirely film backed , this material is available for licensing in 24p hd , 2k and 4k . for more information visit http://www.periscopefilm.com

2014 escape pull behind motorcycle trailer . take luggage & cargo behind your motorcycle , bike , or trike , while touring america .<q>http://www.1motorcycletrailers.com/pull-behind-motorcycle-trailers.html<q>hello ladies and gentlemen , today im going to be showing you the 2014 escape motorcycle trailer , okay so here it goes . this is the all aluminum , with the swivel coupler . moves left and<q>right for when you 're in turns . if you have a trike , dont worry , you do n't need this . give us a call and we will let you trade it in for something else . it does come equipped with the all aluminum<q>cooler rack , all diamond plate top , sides , independent torsion axles , all aluminum chassis ,<q>all aluminum tongue and frame . this makes the tongue weight on the trailer 6 lbs . less than our competitior . see how lightweight it is ? yet it 's very durable . i 'm going to get hurt one day doing this . alright here we go . double sided luggage rack rated for 200 lbs . if you look there are no dents . inside of it is fully carpeted , has a cargo net . has a place for the license plate . has led lights , all aluminum bumper , clean pop rivets .<q>you might be thinking pop rivets are weak . nah . 3 pop rivets on each side hold it on and can support all the weight . fenders are welded onto a bracket and then we bolt the bracket on .<q>so i am going to show you how , alright ... fender did n't budge a bit . comes with a four flat plug , safety chains , chrome coupler that swivels . the luggage rack is polished aluminum , cargo net on the inside . frame underneath for durability and strength .<q>our trailers come with a federal dot approved vin number so you can get the trailer registered in any state . you do n't need to get the trailer inspected . this vin number shows the trailer has already been inspected .<q>spring loaded tongue stand . im going to show you how well built it is . all this and the sides are one piece , the front of it we bend inward . then we put the front panel on so water ca n't get in . then it 's pop riveted with 3/4 inch overlap so no water can get in . there is also a gasket on the inside so when you close it creates a water tight seal .<q>heavy duty paddle style lock just like whats in the back of your pick up . 5.30 x 12 inch tires rated for speeds up to 90 mph . i have personally had it faster than that but anything bigger than that goes on a cargo or utility trailer so you dont want 13 inch tires on something only carrying 300-400 lbs .<q>when you get going 80-90 mph down the highway you wo n't even know our trailer is behind you . we have sold over 3000 of these little trailers and planning on having 4000 sold this time next year .

build a ripped athletic body without any equipment here ...<q>http://athleanx.com/x/build-muscle-without-equipment-here<q>the front lever is one of the most powerful bodyweight exercises that can build a big upper body and strong abs . the problem is , most people do n't know how to properly perform this body weight movement . in this video , i show you a step by step tutorial for mastering the front lever so that you can start seeing the benefits that this great exercise holds for you .<q>to begin with , you must understand what muscles actually power this exercise . mostly you are going to want to get strong in your lats and your abs . the move uses your lats but not at all like you would use them in a traditional pullup . in order to do this exercise right , you want to envision that you are doing a straight arm pushdown while suspended from the bar .<q>the arms should perform a pullover movement or as i said , a straight arm pushdown . this will pull your body and torso back behind the bar which will counterbalance the weight of your legs as you rise up to the bar . this is important because failing to do so will make it hard for you to overcome the force of gravity and get yourself up . of course , you want to be able to contract your abs and core the entire time , as well as your quads , to keep your body rigid as you rise up .<q>you can start to groove this movement pattern for the front lever by performing the broken down pieces on a bar set in a squat rack . you are much lower to the ground in this set up and have more control of your lower body since you can rest your feet and legs on a bench set up in front of you . learn the pushdown movement by putting your feet on the bench and then simply initiating the lift of your butt off the ground by using your lats .<q>once you can achieve this , take it another step further by adding a pullup or inverted row to the top of the movement . use the straight arm pushdown to have the lats pull you off the ground and then add some more back strength by completing the inverted row . attempt to pull up so that the bar crosses somewhere near the mid to low chest . you do this since you want to simulate the position behind the bar that you will need to have to perform the front lever eventually .<q>next , move onto the static hold progression that i show you in the video . first , decrease the length of the moment by keeping your body rolled up tightly into a ball in the reverse tuck position . when you can hang here with ease , allow the thighs to drift away from the body a bit to a point that they are perpendicular to the ground . next , extend one leg out to make the challenge even harder . when able to do one , extend the other out as well for a real challenge .<q>you are now ready to do the front lever while hanging from a bar . start by using a resistance band for assistance to unweight some of your bodyweight and groove the movement . next , go through the same 6 step progression and the next thing you know , you 'll be banging out rep after rep of this killer bodyweight exercise .<q>for a complete bodyweight only program , head to http://athleanx.com/xero and get the athlean xero program . no bands , no benches , no bars needed at all to do this equipment free workout program .<q>for more bodyweight workout videos and exercises you can do without any equipment like the front lever , be sure to subscribe to our channel here on youtube at http://youtube.com/user/jdcav24

watch more how to take care of an aquarium videos : http://www.howcast.com/videos/509941-how-to-clean-a-fish-tank-filter-aquarium-care<q>to clean your fish tank filter , let 's define the word cleaning . cleaning usually means soap , water , sterilization . that 's not what we 're doing here . our goal is to just free all the waste that 's been trapped in the filter and allow the filter to do what its goal is : to filter the impurities in the water by allowing the bacteria that 's growing in your biological filter free access to the water . remember , all the waste , the particulates in the water , is going to clog the pores of your filtration .<q>so we want to unclog those pores . the best way to do it is to take your biological filter and to squeeze it in water in a bucket from the aquarium . so you 'll take water from the aquarium . stick it in a bucket . take your biological filter , maybe it 's a sponge , maybe it 's some bio-balls , and you 'll clean it inside the bucket of water until that all that waste is out .<q>then you can reuse the filter . put it back in your filter . ever year or two years you 're going to want to change the biological media because it 's just going to start to fall apart .<q>there 's also chemical and mechanical filtration . the chemical filtration would be like carbon . that you 'll change every two to four weeks depending on the needs of the aquarium . if the water 's getting very yellow then you 're going to want to change the carbon more frequently . the mechanical filter would be filter floss , a micron sock , that , depending on the stocking densities and how much you feed , would be changed usually every week , two weeks , three weeks .<q>but the goal , again , is to always make sure that your filtration system is working properly . you do n't want a canister filter to be clogged and the water to be coming out very slowly . you do n't want your wet-dry filter to be almost overflowing because the micron socks are clogged .<q>so , every filter 's a little different , but the goal is to not shock your filter . you do n't want to take the filter , clean it in your sink , use hot water , use bleach ; you do n't want to do that . i like to clean the filtration system in water from the aquarium to just remove a lot of the waste and not shock the bacteria . because , remember , bacteria is what 's breaking down the waste in the water , the ammonia , the nitrite , into less toxic forms . so you want to minimize shock .<q>it 's also good to clean your filtration at different times than when you do your water changes . because when you 're doing water changes and gravel siphoning or sand siphoning you 're removing a lot of the waste , but you 're also shocking the system . so , the less shock you do to the tank the better . remember , we 're trying to maintain a good environment we 're not trying to shock it .

stories of people and animals bringing comfort to one another are a dime a dozen on the internet . but every once in a while , an interspecies communion rises above the din . ron krajewski and his horse , metro meteor , are one such pair . the short documentary " my paintbrush bites , " premiering today on the atlantic , tells their remarkable story -- one of a reclusive failed artist who finds redemption in the most unlikely of places .<q>when krajewski rescued metro , the thoroughbred was on the brink of death . he had once been a successful racehorse , with eight winning races at the prestigious belmont park and $ 300,000 in prize money to his name . but severe injuries forced metro 's stable to retire him . krajewski , looking for an affordable horse for his wife to ride , bought metro in the nick of time ; had he not done so , the horse would surely have been sent to the slaughterhouse .<q>shortly after they rescued him , though , the krajewskis would discover just how severe metro 's health problems were . just one trail ride rendered him unable to walk . the vet gave him a year to live . and to make matters worse , the horse had an attitude ; he would often bite or kick those who attempted to touch him .<q>" everybody had said that metro 's not going to amount to anything , " krajewski says in the film . " well , we found a skill for him , and he 's pretty good at it . "<q>krajewski had always dreamed of being an artist , but his abstract paintings never sold . when he noticed metro had an interesting tic -- he would often bob his head up and down and side to side -- krajewski had what he terms a " crazy " idea . he taught metro to hold a paintbrush . using horse treats as a reward , he then taught the horse to touch his nose to the canvas .<q>" he went to town and just started painting , " says krajewski . read more : https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/580789/horse-artist/<q>" my paintbrush bites " was directed by joel pincosy and joe egender . it is part of the atlantic selects , an online showcase of short documentaries from independent creators , curated by the atlantic .<q>subscribe to the atlantic on youtube : http://bit.ly/subatlanticyt

the sidekick and the wimberley head both offer balanced ease of use and comparable quite functionality ; however , each has its strengths and weaknesses . the tilt mechanism is identical in the two . the wimberley gimbal has a very low friction pan base . the sidekick works in conjunction with your existing ball head to form a gimbal-type tripod head . thus , the sidekick uses the pan base of your ball head . therefor , if the ball head pans very smoothly , the sidekick/ball head combination will work very similarly to the wimberley head . however , if your ball head does not have a very smooth pan base or if it is smooth but has a lot of drag , you may prefer the feel of the wimberley head .<q>most of our customers , who use the larger lenses ( e.g. 600 mm f/4 or 400 mm f/2 .8 , ) prefer the wimberley head . the wimberley head is a more straight-forward piece of equipment and tends to inspire more confidence when using larger lenses . with the wimberley head there are fewer knobs to be concerned about and there is no worry that the ball and socket joint of the ball head will slip or creep under the weight of the lens . the wimberley head allows you to mount your lens with its foot below the lens barrel , and this can make it easier to attach a heavy lens to the head .<q>in general , we recommend the sidekick for lenses the size of a 500 mm f/4 or smaller . however , coupled with a good ball head , the sidekick will work beautifully with the largest lenses . many of our customers use 600 f/4 and 400/2 .8 lenses on the sidekick with excellent results . note : because the sidekick mounts to a ball head , it is critical that the ball head is capable of supporting the weight of your lens in a side-mount configuration . not all ball heads are suited for this type of set up . the sidekick is much smaller and lighter than the wimberley head and is much more versatile because it allows you to keep your ball head mounted to your tripod for landscape or portrait0 work . the sidekick can be easily removed from a ball head for normal ball head use with this type of set up . the sidekick is ideal for people who switch from telephoto to short focal lengths often , and , for many it is more suitable for air travel with the stringent weight limitations that exist .<q>many people feel that it is more difficult to mount and adjust large lenses on the sidekick because of the sidekick 's side-mount attachment . some people never become comfortable mounting their big lens in this sideways fashion ; others have no problem with it . although it may seem counterintuitive , side-mounting your lens does not put any extra stress on your lens or ball head . when using the sidekick on a ball head you must be sure not to accidentally loosen the ball or loosen the quick release holding the sidekick to the ball head . this is usually not a problem once you 're familiar with the sidekick , but if you are using very large lenses this should be a consideration . when you are attaching your lens by the side ( as with the sidekick ) you must support the weight of the lens with one hand while you attach the lens or re-balance the lens . this can be a bit difficult and anxiety provoking if you have a very heavy lens . if you have difficulty hoisting the weight of your lens with one hand or if you are not confident with things mechanical , you will most likely prefer the wimberley head to the sidekick .<q>there is no loss of stiffness or stability with the sidekick as compared to the wimberley head . the sidekick coupled with a good ball head is actually stiffer than the wimberley head , although this makes no practical difference since both heads are much stiffer than the tripods that support them .<q>***<q>wimberley is a father-son partnership dedicated to the design and manufacture of the highest quality professional photography equipment . we make tripod gimbal heads for large telephoto lenses , macro accessories , modular flash brackets , arca-swiss style quick-release clamps & plates , and more ... http://www.tripodhead.com/

ginseng is very susceptible to fungus and as a result , it is sprayed with a variety of fungicides to reduce the chances of the plant building up a tolerance to just one chemical . consumed as a holistic herb taken for general well-being , the residue of fungicides on the root is considered a harmful additive which detracts from its healing properties . robert eidus , owner of eagle feather organic farm , explains how ginseng is not regulated for the presence of fungicides and as a result , much of the ginseng that is sold for public consumption is tainted with harmful chemicals . there is an alternative form of ginseng and that is in a wild-grown or wild-simulated root without the use of fungicides . robert explains the organic method he uses to ` immunize ' ginseng against the soil-born fungus . by steeping goldenseal roots and rhizomes in hot water , he makes a concentrated tea that he uses to wash the soil in the raised beds . once the soil has been washed with the antibacterial and antimicrobial properties of goldenseal , the ginseng seeds are then planted . to combat air-born fungus , robert sprays the ginseng seedlings with horsetail . after it rains , a new coating of horsetail spray should be applied . while this method may be more feasible for smaller patches of ginseng , growing ginseng and goldenseal together may help reduce the spread of fungus such as phytophthora .

this video covers the four season books that are included in the waldorf kindergarten curriculum from live-education .<q>we use the live-education waldorf curriculum as inspiration for grades k-8th . today , i 'm covering three of the seven books that come in the kg curriculum : folk and fairy tales , the first seven years and introduction to kg . you can find the curriculum and more pictures at live-education 's website :<q>http://www.live-education.com<q>the other four books : autumn , winter , spring , and summer are covered in another video :<q>in a waldorf curriculum , the day follows a rhythm as does the week and the season . each day of the week is devoted to a grain , color and activity , for instance monday 's color is purple and the grain in rice . washing and cleaning dominate monday 's activities , while tuesday 's color is red and the grain is oats . tuesday 's breakfast may be oatmeal topped with red strawberries . tuesday 's activity may be bread making or soup making . each week the same pattern is repeated , but instead of strawberries , raspberries top the oatmeal . when the seasons change , so do the activities and celebrations . may day , singing , outdoor activities and gardening dominate spring time , while candle making , baking and holidays dominate the winter .<q>toys are simple and made of natural materials with wool being preferred over cotton and wood being preferred over metal . there is a tendency towards items made from living things over non-living things , so wool is from a sheep while cotton is from a plant and wood is from a tree while metal is inorganic . plastic is highly discouraged . natural light is favored over artificial light and candle light is preferred over oil , as candles are made from beeswax . colors are natural and derived from plants .<q>playthings include but are not limited to silks , faceless dolls ( allows for greater imagination ) , wooden toys and blocks , wooden or felt swords and shields , child-sized versions of tools such as broom , mop , ironing board , kitchen , garden , wood shop , etc. and other dolls like finger puppets or peg dolls .<q>activities and play time are open ended and lend themselves well to creative imagination . art is focused on water-coloring and drawing with block crayons in yellow , blue and red on large pieces of paper or watercolor paper ( typically 22 " x17 " ) . high end supplies are always encouraged and are a staple to the waldorf philosophy .<q>no academics are present in kindergarten .<q>festivals and celebrates mark important milestones in the world of five and six year olds .<q>some books i recommend :<q>children and their temperaments by marieke anschutz<q>storytelling & the art of imagination by nancy mellon<q>healing stories for challenging behavior by susan perrow<q>you are your child 's first teacher by rahima baldwin<q>the education of the child by rudolf steiner<q>the kingdom of childhood by rudolf steiner<q>the following are the materials we got from a child 's dream :<q>art tissue paper -

paul speaks with kristen about early earthen oil lamps and ushabti on abc 's good news show in florida 's panhandle .<q>about ushabti :<q>the ushabti ( also called shabti or shawabti , with a number of variant spellings ) were funerary figurines used in ancient egypt . they were placed in tombs among the grave goods and were intended to act as substitutes for the deceased , should he/she be called upon to do manual labor in the afterlife . they were used from the middle kingdom ( around 1900 bc ) until the end of the ptolemaic period nearly 2000 years later .<q>most ushabtis were of minor size , and many produced in multiples -- they sometimes covered the floor around a sarcophagus . exceptional ushabtis are of larger size , or produced as a one-of-a-kind master work .<q>about oil lamps :<q>an oil lamp is a man-made object used to produce light continuously for a period of time using an oil-based fuel source . the use of oil lamps began thousands of years ago and is continued to this day .<q>oil lamps are a form of lighting , and were used as an alternative to candles before the use of electric lights . starting in 1780 the argand lamp quickly replaced other oil lamps still in their basic ancient form . these were , in turn , replaced by the kerosene lamp in about 1850 . in small towns and rural areas these continued in use well into the 20th century , until such areas were finally electrified , and light bulbs could be used for lighting .<q>grace estate buyers & manor auctions is an industry leader in the acquisition , marketing and sale of original art , timepieces , fine jewelry , diamonds , coins , ivory , jade , militaria , historic documents and collectibles . both grace and manor have representatives available nationwide and offers no cost consignment consultations . from a single item , to a specialty collection or estate - contact grace estate buyers or manor auctions for a consultation .<q>www.manorauctions.com | 850-523-3787

in this video i experiment if a rocket can fly in a vacuum chamber . i use a special method so that we can observe the rocket exhaust thrust in order to make sure that the vacuum chamber stays under vacuum and that the rocket is not pushing off of any chamber walls . in order to do this i use a soda can as my rocket . since the compressed co2 is dissolved in the liquid we can actually observe the expansion of the gas by looking at the liquid in slow motion . this is needed in order to show that the rocket does not push of the walls of the vacuum chamber , but is actually moving because of the momentum of the expanding gas being thrown out the back . this is the same way that rockets work in space . i love this experiment because it shoots down any crazy notion that surrounding air is somehow needed or something to push of is needed in order for a rocket to fly in space !<q>visit my facebook page at :<q>https://www.facebook.com/hydraulicpressfuntoday/<q>send me things to crush or put in my vacuum chamber or pressure chamber at :<q>po box 482<q>north plains or 97133<q>* if you do send me something message me so i know it 's coming !<q>checkout my science channel :<q>https://www.youtube.com/channel/uca19majuryyhbjzhfpqhpca<q>for more awesome videos checkout :<q>perfect oreo separation using a vacuum chamber<q>https://youtu.be/oszx7g0v4xk<q>how to survive being vacuum bagged ! i vacuum bagged myself<q>https://youtu.be/fmcoucb2lmk<q>how long can a fidget spinner spin in a vacuum chamber ? will it spin forever ?<q>https://youtu.be/3v3oohsb-6g<q>a liquid that pours itself ! the self-siphoning fluid : polyethylene glycol<q>https://youtu.be/t3nequhodra<q>what happens when you drop a mentos in coke in a vacuum chamber ?<q>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da2ofkyu6xi<q>what happens when i put my arm in a vacuum chamber ? will it explode ?<q>https://youtu.be/iwggmchu6mq<q>shooting fruit with supersonic ping pong balls | first vacuum cannon test<q>https://youtu.be/ts7v07lxmtq<q>what happens when you put a spider and a fly in a vacuum chamber ? will they survive ?<q>https://youtu.be/ta9jciwvge0<q>if you drop a feather and a metal cube in a vacuum chamber will they hit at the same time ?<q>https://youtu.be/s9zb3xagioy<q>what happens when you put aerogel in a vacuum chamber and hydraulic press ?<q>https://youtu.be/tdgbyo0pioy<q>what happens when you put 16 twinkies in a huge vacuum chamber ?<q>https://youtu.be/vaq2kr5wniy<q>snow turned into clear sheet of ice by a hydraulic press<q>https://youtu.be/fimnrnggnuq<q>what happens when you put a speaker in a huge vacuum chamber ? can you hear it ?<q>https://youtu.be/657cans8nry<q>what happens when you put 6 eggs in a huge vacuum chamber ?<q>https://youtu.be/mzjcsdpmiuc<q>what happens when you put a drone in a vacuum ? can it still fly ?<q>https://youtu.be/g8-pxkaipcg<q>what happens when you put a can of soda in a huge vacuum<q>https://youtu.be/bszmnu4pwf8<q>what happens when you put shaving cream balloons in a huge vacuum chamber ?<q>https://youtu.be/cs7tdht9nmu<q>i made a square balloon by putting it in a huge vacuum chamber<q>https://youtu.be/zyljgxthzpe<q>what happens when you put 30 marshmallows in a huge vacuum chamber ?<q>https://youtu.be/ouhbzk-lk24<q>do n't spray sodium metal with water after flattening it in a hydraulic press !<q>https://youtu.be/xwyvd8mexag<q>extracting cyanide from apple seeds with hydraulic press<q>https://youtu.be/-0lipwuutw8<q>how strong is human hair composite when crushed in a hydraulic press ?<q>https://youtu.be/jvsykrydtsa<q>starburst crushed and folded with hydraulic press into 64 layers<q>https://youtu.be/yk4wksgvrc8

http://www.clutterdiet.com get organized with home organizing tips from professional organizers at the clutter diet . it 's that time of the year ... so , today we are talking about gift wrap . setting up a gift wrap station is really easy and it can save you a lot of time during the holiday season . do you know where your gift tags are ? how about that special bag of bows , or the scissors , or tape ? in this video lorie marrero discusses strategies to create your own gift wrap station . organize your gift bags , tissue paper , bows , wrap , scissors , tape , name tags -- and making presenting your presents a breeze . and would n't stress free holiday giving be a great gift this year ? these clutter video tips are posted frequently here on our clutterdiet organizing channel . you can search twitter for #cluttervideotip also to find comments on our organizing tips . lorie marrero is the creator of clutterdiet.com and the author of the clutter diet : the skinny on organizing your home and taking control of your life . lorie also serves as the national spokesperson for goodwill industries international and ambassador of the donate movement .<q>transcript :<q>hi . i 'm lorie marrero and today 's clutter video tip is about gift wrap stations . now , first i want to dispel [ pop ] a big myth -- that you have to have some kind of beautiful dedicated counter space with a spindle for your ribbons and all of that set aside year-round for your gift wrap station . you do n't have to have that . most people ca n't have that . they do n't have enough space . almost everyone is going to be using a closet , under the bed , or their guest room [ pop ] for their gift wrap station . and that 's exactly what i 'm doing right now . it 's the holiday season , i 'm getting everything out . i 'm putting it out on the bed in my own guest room and i 'm going to show you how i set that up .<q>let 's talk about rolls of gift wrap . first , you want to have fewer rolls to store in the first place by buying some solid colors and even craft paper , and decorating those with ribbons and accessories for the occasion rather than buying lots of different special occasion wraps like this baby gift wrap here . when you 're ready to store those rolls of wrap , there are a couple of different options . one is my favorite , the under-bed storage containers . that keeps these dust-free and really accessible and ready when you want to just pull them in and out from under the bed . [ pop ] and then you can also get a special upright container that are just made for gift wrap , or even use a tall garbage can for a corner of a closet somewhere .<q>i really prefer gift bags and i like to reuse them , which makes them a really eco-friendly option . the best way i found to sort and store these is by category . i have all the holiday bags and then the children 's bags and then the [ pop ] other or all-purpose bags together inside the largest bag of that category .<q>now let 's talk about the tools and accessories you 'll need to wrap your gifts . nothing fancy is required here . all i have are three bins -- one for tissue paper , one for bows , and one for ribbons , and then i have a smaller bin for the little tools and supplies like gift tags , sticky notes , markers and , of course , scissors . i do believe it 's great to have a dedicated [ pop ] tape dispenser for your gift wrap area because it makes it possible to get a piece of tape using only one hand . and finally , i love my collapsible trash can and i keep that up in my guest room all season long for the trash that results from wrapping all of these gifts .<q>if you would like some help this holiday season , especially getting ready for the new year , we have a team of organizing experts available to help you personally in our membership program on-line . we can help anybody from anywhere in an affordable way . you can learn more at clutterdiet.com/learnmore .<q>and remember , especially this holiday season , it 's more important than ever to be happy and grateful for having more than enough .

losing your mind to alcohol<q>i have a question from claire , she says , " hi annie , i 've watched so many of your q & a 's and i 've read your book ( visit https://www.thisnakedmind.com/book to start reading today ! ) and jason vale 's and i consciously get all of it , but it seems that one area that is n't covered is i know alcohol does n't taste nice , i know it 's bad for my body , i know i 'll hate myself tomorrow , but for now , right now , i just want to lose myself and i like that alcohol does that for me . i 'm totally aware that i drink to just f my brain up just for a little while . can you help me with that one ? i 've just done day six . i 'm a regular drinker who would like to cut back or stop . "<q>what can alcohol do ?<q>i can write a book about all the things that alcohol actually does n't do . it does n't relax us , certainly not over time . even though it feels like it in the moment . it does n't increase our pleasure in life . it actually decreases from pleasure in life . all these things i can prove scientifically with tons of internal and external evidence that alcohol does n't actually do . even though a lot of what the advertisements tell us it will do . it does n't increase connection , it does n't end loneliness , all these things , but to your point , can you attribute losing your mind to alcohol ? does it make your brain turn off when your brain wo n't stop ? does it just obliviate you in a way ?<q>alcohol dumbs you down<q>yes . yes . that 's what alcohol does . you are losing your mind to alcohol in every sense . if you drink , you will eventually become unconscious because it makes your neurons fire slower , your thought processes slow down and if you drink enough , it will make you pass out . it erases your ability to think and it numbs you to the point where you can no longer function and you can no longer use your senses . it dulls your senses . so , if you are drinking to erase what 's going on in your head , alcohol will do that for you .<q>numb<q>i want to be really up front and honest about that because i 'm not going to try to convince you of something that alcohol wo n't do . alcohol will numb and obliviate you . it will take away your senses and your memory . it will lessen your ability to be present in reality and ultimately to the point you become unconscious . so , i 'm not going to argue that point . that 's a fact . that 's what alcohol does . you are losing your mind to alcohol .<q>why ?<q>the question is why in your life do you want to do that ? why do you not want to be present in your own life ?<q>what is it about your life that 's going on that is so hard to show up and be present for and why do you want to turn off your thoughts ?<q>keep listening<q>learn more about being present and processing emotions rather than losing your mind to alcohol by tuning in to the complete video .

in this video we tour a traditional icelandic turf house at the islenski baerinn turf house museum ( http://islenskibaerinn.is/english/ ) . turf houses are the original green buildings because they were built using local and natural materials . in southern iceland they used turf from the local wetlands and lava stones to build thick walls that would insulate the houses against wind and cold weather . they imported small amounts of wood , or used driftwood .<q>most turf houses in iceland were torn down after world war ii when people were encouraged to modernize their homes which means there are almost no turf houses left . so we felt really lucky to visit the islenski baerinn turf house museum in southern iceland and meet with hannes who runs the museum and whose grandparents and great grandparents used to live on , and run , the farm .<q>traditional turf houses , and especially turf houses on farms were built in clusters so you 'll see there 's many houses all linked together . only one of them is actually the living space where you 'll find the beds . and then in the other houses you would find things like a horse stable or a food processing area , and they did this to take advantage of insulation from shared walls . each house is joined together with hallways so that people could go from one area of the house to the other without having to go outside .<q>inside the main home you can see that all of the beds were in one room and this was where everyone did all of their work , where they slept , where they ate , where they gave birth . everything in an icelanders life happened in this main living space and it really was communal living .<q>in addition to having really thick walls made with the lava stones and the turf , the houses are also dug and built into the back of a hill so that they 're protected from the cold northerly winds .<q>hannes completely restored this old farmstead with his wife and mother , and while he continued to use the traditional methods using the turf and the lava stones for the walls , he did use corrugated iron for some of the outer walls and some of the newer roofs .<q>it 's really incredible to see how cozy and liveable these small spaces are even though they 're built with such basic natural materials .<q>if you 're interested in turf houses and green buildings ( and if you 're planning a visit to iceland ! ) , we would definitely recommend visiting the islenski baerinn turf house museum - it was probably our favourite part of our trip !!! they have a website here if you want to learn more :<q>http://islenskibaerinn.is/english/<q>you can also follow them on facebook , and instagram :<q>https://www.facebook.com/islenskibaerinn<q>https://www.instagram.com/islenski_baerinn/<q>we also want to say a big thank you to eyvi ( eyjólfur eyjólfsson ) who we met at the vöðlakot cafe at the islenski baerinn turf house museum who fed us delicious coffee & home made pancakes , and who took the time to play his beautiful langspil instrument that you see and hear at the beginning of the video .<q>thanks for watching !<q>mat & danielle<q>-------------------------------------------------------------<q>stay in touch !<q>------------------------------------------------------------<q>blog : www.exploringalternatives.ca<q>facebook : / exploringalternativesblog<q>instagram : @exploringalternatives<q>music & song credits :<q>the music in this video was composed , performed , and recorded by mat of exploring alternatives , except for the opening and closing song .<q>the opening and closing song in this video is called " langspils-kvæðalag " and is partly folksong but mostly composed by örn magnusson . it was performed by eyjólfur eyjólfsson who we met at the vöðlakot cafe at the islenski baerinn turf house museum .
stress hives is also known as a stress rash and occurs when you have too much stress and anxiety in your life . learn which stress hives treatment works best at http://www.hives.org/stress-hives.php<q>what are stress hives ?<q>stress hives are red , raised swollen areas and bumps ( aka stress bumps ) that appear on your skin , that develop due to too much stress or anxiety in your life . stress hives can itch like crazy , giving you the feeling like ants or spiders are crawling over your skin . the only way to get rid of your stress hives is to remove all the stress and anxiety form your life . because this is a near impossibility for most people , there is one stress hives treatment , known as oxyhives , that can be taken that reduces the swelling and itchy feeling within 2 hours .<q>can stress cause hives ?<q>definitely ! a stress rash can occur anytime you are feeling over stressed and anxious . too much stress in your life will adversely affect your immune system which will cause it to start sending histamine to fight what is ailing you . unfortunately , stress is n't something that the immune system can " fight off " , so the end result is that you get stress induced hives . in essence , those itchy bumps all over your face , neck , chest , arms , legs and pretty much your whole body sometimes , are caused by stress . learn what causes hives at http://www.hives.org/hives-causes.php<q>what are the symptoms of a stress rash ?<q>the symptoms of a stress rash include red bumps and swollen areas on your skin that seem to appear randomly . quite often , they are incredibly itchy and can also have a prickly or burning sensation when touched . do n't scratch them ! do n't be surprised if your stress rash appears on your face , neck and chest , as that is where i get mine . others get them on their arms and legs . stress hives can be as small as a pencil eraser or as big as a dinner plate ! often the smaller hives meld with the bigger hives to make one big messy outbreak that looks absolutely terrible . however , with the right over the counter medication , like oxyhives , you 'll be able to get rid of them in no time .<q>how to get rid of hives fast<q>if you want to remove stress hives from your life forever , then all you need to do is remove all the stress and anxiety form your life . if only it were that easy , right ? as i discovered from my dermatologist , the only treatment that will make your stress bumps go away for good is oxyhives . it takes 1-2 hours , but it works for me each and every time . with 2 small kids , i may not be able to remove all the stress form my life , but at least i can remove the rash and hives that appear when i get stressed out . learn more about oxyhives and how to get rid of your hives fast at http://www.hives.org/how-to-get-rid-of-hives.php<q>if this video has been helpful , please give me a thumbs up :-) and feel free to watch the other videos in my channel as well at https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucqg18x4cek_ntcaqhzl4rrq

imagine if there was a perfect number , a single number so ...<q>bonus video @patreon http://www.patreon.com/strangemysteries<q>narration provided by jam advertising new mexico www.tasteofjam.com<q>flawless it formed the basis for all art and music ; a number so important that it could be used across the disciplines of mathematics and physics , and a number so profoundly purposeful that the natural world and the universe would bend to its whims . the fibonacci sequence is a string of numbers that begins with zero and one which can be extended infinitely by adding up any two consecutive numbers to find the next in the sequence . the golden ratio is a mathematical term used to describe the relationship of two figures , whereby the numbers seem to be in some form of complimentary ratio.to link the fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio we must look at the ratio between two consecutive numbers in fibonacci , and observe the pattern this ratio takes as you use ever higher numbers . the golden ratio has fascinated the world 's most knowledgeable people for millennia since its discovery , and we have seen its influence in some of the finest works mankind has ever produced . is the golden ratio a universal law applied by nature ? the evidence seems to suggest so , and the aforementioned leonardo da vinci may have alluded to this in some of his most famous works .

http://www.realmilkpaint.com/products/waxes/clear-carnauba-wax/<q>in this video , dwayne from real milk paint discusses how to use carnauba wax .<q>it 's made from carnauba wax and beeswax , along with paraffin wax and a solvent , turpentine .<q>the reason why it 's made from those additional ingredients is that carnauba wax is too hard on its own .<q>when you open up a can , you 'll see a creamy , paste-like texture .<q>so , let 's take a closer look and learn how to use carnauba wax . dwayne recommends using something simple and soft like an old sock for application .<q>as soon as you start to rub in the carnauba furniture wax , you 'll begin to see a color difference . after letting the wax sit for a bit , you can then buff it away with a rag and you 'll be left with a great sheen after just minutes .<q>once you master the art of how to wax furniture with carnauba wax , you 'll benefit from all of its many advantages .<q>it offers a high sheen , without being tacky or sticky during application . it also wo n't melt in the sun , and it works well on all types of painted surfaces .<q>that includes milk paint over all types of different materials . in the video , you 'll see dwayne work on a stool painted with milk paint as well .<q>put our own carnauba furniture wax to use at home today by making a purchase here : http://bit.ly/1mfdt00

if you ask me a question about : ` what is the one quality that i would want my child to possess ? ' my answer will be : that she should be a great reader and i believe rest of the qualities will follow by itself . like : being creative , aware , confident , leadership , orator , exposed , connected , good communication , witty and the list is unending .<q>we are living in the time of the world where children are exposed to so many things that books get a very less share of their time . these things as we very well know are television , mobile phones , various applications , gaming consoles etc. now imagine a child 's day with an hour of all these things ( 3 ) now add a minimum of three hours of school ( 3 ) , then an hour of park time ( 1 ) , an hour of eating time ( 1 ) ( i am also collaborating eating time with one of these unwanted things time ) and another one hour of homework ( 1 ) . total we get 9 hours . it is a very rough estimate , plus minus here and there is expected . so now imagine how much time will your child be able to give to books ?<q>in our time i remember books used to be our best friends , it was actually a mean to meet new people and go visit new places . but compared to today 's world our children are already there .<q>so i believe that if we want our children to have some time that they willingly involve books in their daily life we need to make some efforts . we need to make books as interesting as the other things and i am confident that once children have got into the habit or should i say tasted the blood of reading books there is no looking back . i also believe in doing this as soon as possible . that is why i started working towards making reading fun for my child at a toddler age .<q>this is the reason i am posting this video for all those who believe in what i have mentioned above and hope it will help .<q>so , how i made reading fun for my toddler ? it was a difficult task to do as initially books were just for eating , tearing and chewing purpose . i could not make her sit at one place to read a book .<q>she was only curious about things that were new , full of adventure , something to touch and feel to . so i thought of adding these elements of novelty , curiosity , hands of learning and adventure to book reading . as her brain at this age or for that matter any toddler 's brain gets attracted to these elements and anything that have these , becomes desirable and fun . once the brain started connecting these elements to book reading ; it too became fun and desirable .<q>i just had to put in some initial efforts and now i have a toddler who loves her books . now i do not have to add these elements mentioned above as once the connection of fun between brain with books are made the element of imagination is born which now empowers all of them and takes care of the process .<q>so what did i do and how did i do this :<q>one : i scattered books everywhere in the house wherever she could reach<q>two : i tried variety of books like sound books , touch and feel , flip flap , follow the trail , bath books , rattle books etc<q>three : a thing that did not work for my child was the educational books like : these are fruits , or vegetables , or farm animals etc. so story books became a great part of our journey .<q>four : the most important part . i did a lot of fun and play activities with my child based on books that i read to her . so initially what used to happen was : for example if i plan to read a book to her and she being a toddler did not sit at one place so i will quickly show her a page of that book read it aloud and then introduce a game/activity related to that page which will interest her . once she was done with that activity , i would wrap it up and show her the next page , read to her quickly and then introduce another activity related to the next page . so this is how i read books to her initially by doing various activities .<q>slowly gradually the activity level came down and book reading became fun as she started enjoying imagining the story .<q>now are the days where she is two years three months old and she herself goes to her library , get a book and ask me to read to her .<q>this video is my first and small effort of showcasing how i made reading fun to my child and i hope this will help more parents to interest their children in reading .<q>hope you all will enjoy and benefit from this video . do let me know if you have any queries regarding making reading fun to your child and i will be happy to help .<q>do try and follow this method and in case you get stuck in thinking of activities related to any book , do feel free to comment below and i will try and help you out with it .<q>happy reading to your child !

save a $ 1,000 off a tesla and get free supercharging using http://ts.la/theodore6632<q>first tesla p100d ludicrous plus with the performance easter egg out at the dragstrip . going back to where tesla racing channel began 2 years ago at the famous piedmont dragway . we even inserted some clips from our p85d when it did its first pass in insane mode running a 7.4 and a 11.6 quarter mile . fast forward two years from then and this car now is a full second faster in the quarter mile running 10.6 s show room floor stock . that 's an achievement not accomplished by possibly any car company before improving their top model by a full second e.t. this car even put down a 2.38 0 to 60 at the dragstrip , murdering the faraday future and its hype .
today we took our baby bird to a certified bird rehabilitator that rescues and nurtures birds . they did very well in our care , but we ca n't teach them how to fly and gather food on their own so through the many volunteer organizations that i spoke with the last 24 hours , i say thanks - the alabama wildlife rescue , staffed by volunteers how take phone calls from 8 am - 9 pm every day , aware the atlanta wildlife area rescue group that has vets on call 24 hours a day to rescue all types of animals , and people like debbie ( in this video ) that nurtures birds and racoons so they can live in the wild . it 's been a great experience but just a reminder that it 's always best if birds can be cared for by their mother - because we all know that moms are the very best at taking care of their little one - feathered or non-feathered ! enjoy

https://www.etrailer.com/tv-install-brake-controller-2013-ford-f150-etbc7.aspx<q>today on our 2013 ford f-150 supercrew , we 'll be installing the universal trailer kit for trailer brake control seven-way rv and four-way flat , part number etbc7 . the etbc7 is a universal kit to allow you to even install a brake controller on your vehicle that already has a four-way flat mounted on it . this kit also allows you to run the 12-volt power supply back to your seven-way as well as you brake controller back to the seven-way . now in this particular vehicle , there 's already a four-way flat from the factory that we 'll be tying in with . also in this installation , we will be running all the wires for the 12-volt power as well as running a wire up for the brake controller but we 'll not actually be installing the brake controller during this installation . we will show all the other connections at the rear of the vehicle as well as how we 'll tie in for the 12-volt hot lead back at the seven-way . we 'll begin back here at the rear of the vehicle .<q>you can see here how the original or factory four-flat was already mounted . we 'll go ahead and remove this from its bracket and we 'll be tying this in with the etbc7 four and seven-way plug . now you 'll see that there 's a bracket that comes with the kit that the seven and four-way will screw to . now this particular customer has asked for us to mount this as high as we could , so we 're actually going to use part of the factory mounting bracket that held the original four-way in place . we 'll go ahead and take the brackets supplied with the kit , line it up , and drill a hole through each side . once the bracket has two holes in it , we 'll then go ahead and put two holes in the factory four-flat bracket on the truck itself .<q>now you may need to bend the bracket on the vehicle itself just a little bit untiloffer some proper clearance of the seven-way door to open up and not hit the bumper cover . we did have to bend it down just a little bit . now that we 've got our holes drilled , we 'll go ahead and connect the seven and four-way bracket to the factory bracket on the truck using two screws and two lock nuts . once that 's done , nowwe 're ready to go ahead and connect our seven andfour-way plug to the bracket we just installed . to do this , we use the four screws and nuts supplied with the kit . the screws and nuts that we connect to seven and four-way to the bracket are the ones that use a flathead screwdriver on one side and a wrench on the other side .<q>once we have this tighten down and we 're sure that the seven-way door opens far enough , now we 're ready to go ahead and make our electrical connections and then run our wire to the front of the vehicle . now you can also see that there 's some other wires that come off of this plug as well . there 's a blue wire which will actually run up to the brake controller , there 's a black wire which is your 12-volt hot power lead . there 's a white wire with a ring terminal on it which is the ground wire and there 's the purple wire which is to the reverse light circuit . now we will not be installing the purple wire so this wire will just get taped up later after we make some other connections . you 'll also notice that the kit comes with a length of wire that has a black and white wire in a gray sheeting .<q>these two wires will be connected to the blue wire and the black wire that are plugged at the rear of the vehicle by the butt connectors already on the plug wires . we 'll then go ahead and strip some wire back so we can connect it to our butt connectors . the black wire will go to the black wire and the white wire will go to the blue wire or essentially become the brake feed if we we 're to put a brake controller in this vehicle . once our butt connections made , we 'll go ahead and put some electrical tape on it to protect it . now for our fourflat , now you 'll noticed on the factory four-way there 's already some dielectric grease on this connection . if there was no grease already here , we would be adding some dielectric grease to give the connection some protection . this is part number 11755 . now , we 'll go ahead and plug the four-way in from the factory as well as to the connection on the back of our plug . once this connection is made , we 'll go ahead and put a zip tie on it to help make sure that this four flat connection stays together . now that that 's done , we 'll go ahead and use some electrical tape to taped up all of our connection back here . now , we 'll leave the white wire wi

stella artois world draught master allaine schaiko takes us through the stella artois 9-step pouring ritual in this beer pouring tutorial .<q>subscribe to stella artois : http://goo.gl/valvfr<q>world 's greatest events : http://events.stellaartois.com/<q>the stella artois 9-step pouring ritual is a series of steps to pour the perfect beer :<q>1 . the purification : the chalice is rinsed with cold water , allowing the glass to reach the same temperature as the beer .<q>2 . the sacrifice : the tap is opened in one swift motion to let the first burst of foam flow away to ensure every drop of your stella artois is fresh .<q>3 . the liquid alchemy : the chalice is held at a 45-degree angle so that when the beer begins to circulate , it creates the ideal proportion of foam relative to liquid .<q>4 . the crown : the creation of the foam head occurs by straightening and lowering the glass . this initial foam is important as it prevents the beer from coming into contact with the air and losing any flavor .<q>5 . the removal : the tap is closed in one smooth action and the chalice is quickly removed to prevent any drops from falling into the glass .<q>6 . the beheading : while the head is flowing over the edge of the glass , your bartender cuts it gently with a knife on a 45-degree angle . this eliminates the larger bubbles , which burst easily and accelerate the dissipation of the head .<q>7 . the judgment : your bartender then checks that the foam is 2 fingers ( 3 cm ) thick . the final head creates a protective " " cap " " that keeps your stella artois from going stale .<q>8 . the cleansing : your bartender then rinses the bottom and sides of the glass . this step keeps the outside of the chalice clean and comfortable to hold .<q>9 . the bestowal : finally , your stella artois is served to you on a coaster , accompanied by the drip catcher at the base . behold the perfect glass of stella artois . cheers to you , and for your patience , a refreshing reward .

accounting for a franchise ( licensing agreement ) as an intangible asset , contract related : ( franchise & licensing agreements , construction permits , broadcast rights , and service or supply contracts ) ,1-amortize the cost of a franchise ( or license ) with limited life as operating expense over the life of the franchise , 2-do not amortize with an indefinite life nor a perpetual franchise , instead carry such franchise at cost on balance sheet , based onfranchise example : on 1/1/20x1 corp-a entered an agreement to operate a franchise of abc services for an initial franchise fee of $ 150,000 , of this amount $ 30,000 was paid when agreement was signed and the balance is payable in ( 4 ) annual payments $ 30,000 discounted at 14 % ( pv = $ 87,411 ) , the agreement also provides a 5 % revenue from the franchise to the franchisor annually , revenue from the franchise during 20x1 was $ 1,800,000 , useful life of franchise estimated at 10 years , for this example the franchise cost is the present value of the four payments of $ 30,000 each plus the initial payment of $ 30,000 = 117,411 , the amortization per year is this amount divided by the useful life of 10 years , there is also a yearly franchise fee , detailed calculations by allen mursau

i am always on the hunt for easy dinner recipes for my kids especially ones full of vegetables . these veggie loaded sloppy joes have about half the sugar of regular sloppy joes and the sugar it does have added is in the ketchup and coconut sugar ! this is a seriously healthy dinner recipe for your kids and your husbands . actually the first time i tested this recipe my kids were asleep and my husband was ripping these sloppy joe bites out of my hand !! this is a really fairly simple recipe to make and if you get your kids in the kitchen to make it with you they will probably be even more excited to eat it . you can choose your own buns but i highly suggest trying out the gluten free/grain free braze bites which is authentic brazilian bread . they are soft and gooey and wonderful and their mini size make them even more fun ! do n't forget to subscribe to our channel for more kid approved easy dinner recipes and hopefully get inspired to cook with your kids , the results are worth it ! xoxo katelyn<q>veggie loaded sloppy joe minisfeaturing brazi bites<q>meat<q>1 medium zucchini ( shredded or chopped )<q>i used my ninja chopper because it is amazing and i use it to chop all my veggies<q>1 medium yellow squash ( shredded or chopped )<q>2 lb ground beef<q>1 med onion ( chopped )<q>sauce<q>1.5 cup water<q>1 cup ketchup<q>1 1/2 tablespoons worcestershire sauce<q>1/2 tablespoon dried mustard or brown mustard<q>1/4 cup coconut sugar<q>1 tablespoon chili powder<q>salt & pepper , to taste<q>1 6oz can tomato paste<q>buns<q>brazil bites ( i used the original )<q>tools<q>ninja chopper<q>2 medium size skillets<q>slow cooker ( if desired )<q>baking sheet<q>for full recipe head over to my blog at www.thebejuledlife.com<q>and do n't forget to follow us on pinterest , instagram , and twitter !<q>my husband has always had a love affair with sloppy joes . i actually had never tried sloppy joes before we got married and then in effort to be a good wife i tried to make them our first year of marriage . i could never enjoy them because they were so overly sweet , messy , and seemed like a waste of calories . i was so happy to come across lauren 's latest veggie loaded sloppy joes : http://www.laurenslatest.com/healthier-crockpot-sloppy-joes/<q>that included tons of veggies . i slightly adapted her recipe to fit our paleo efforts and used coconut sugar and less ketchup ( although not perfectly paleo ) . and then i put them on the gluten free bite size dream buns brazi bites as seen on shark tank ! i am kinda obsessed with these bites that are made with tapioca starch and cheese . they melt in your mouth and they are just so cute . my kids flipped . my husband flipped . and i now have a new fun healthy treat to bring to partys . this is the perfect kids food because they are exciting and oh so mini . i hope you enjoy them as much as we do and get your kids in the kitchen to make these , you are sure to have a bonding blast !<q>graphics powered by @rachelroe_art / / www.rachelroedesign.com
http://www.joecrump.com/youtube<q>read joe crumps blog :<q>http://joecrumpblog.com/<q>read the transcription :<q>joe : hey , it 's joe crump . i 've got another video here for you . this one is from karen smith in columbus , indiana .<q>karen : " joe , can you explain the millionaire matrix ? does it really work and can you do it without down payments or using your credit ? "<q>joe : absolutely , it works . the millionaire matrix is a structure that i teach that shows people how they can actually make a million dollars in equity and in cash within 2 years by buying just one property per month using no credit and no down payment . and instead of just me explaining it in this video with a talking head , i 'm going to pull up a little power point here and show you exactly how this process works .<q>joe : i created this little power point to show you what the millionaire matrix is and how and why it works .<q>joe : before you can understand how it works , you need to understand the principles behind it and why it works . that brings us to the idea of businesses in general . 90 % of all of the businesses that start up fail in the first year , whereas 90 % of all new franchises succeed . why is that ? why would franchises succeed and businesses in general , not succeed ? and the big answer is -- systems . franchises have step by step systems to show the business owner ( the person who 's implementing the tactics in the strategy of the business ) how to do each little system in the business .<q>joe : let 's take the ultimate systematization -- mcdonald 's . if you go to a mcdonald 's , everything is done the same at every mcdonald 's that you go to because each of their processes is spelled out in a specific system . they have a system for making a big mac . they have a button to press when it 's time to flip the burger . they know how many burgers to put on there , they know what order to have with a picture of a hamburger , and how to put it together where it shows you that that 's where the bun goes and that 's where the hamburger goes and that 's where the lettuce goes and that 's where the special sauce goes . and it makes it very easy for people that are not very skilled to put together a hamburger consistently all over the world . whether it 's here in indianapolis or whether it 's in wisconsin or california or berlin or paris or ireland -- it does n't matter -- wherever you go to a mcdonald 's , you 're going to get the same burger -- it 's going to be put together the same way by the same skill level of people . now , mcdonald 's has a 200 % employee turnover every year . that means that they 're constantly trying to train new people . for them to get that consistency , they have to have a system in place to make that business work .<q>joe : and that 's what i 've created in the push button method and the mentor program . i 've created systems so that i can take new people ( people that have never been real estate investors before ) and give them a system and say , ` step 1 , do this . step 2 , do this . step 3 , do this . '<q>joe : that takes us to the next question in the process here , which is what types of deals make you money . you need to understand that as well . in real estate , there 's only two types of deal that 'll make you money . one is properties that you buy substantially under market value , either for cash or as an assignable cash offer . and two is properties that you can buy at market value or below but you can buy them on terms . now , by terms we 're talking about zero down structures that i teach ; subject-to , multi-mortgage , land contract , contract for deed , lease option , assignable cash deals . those are terms and if you can buy properties on terms like that , then you can make money even if you buy them very close to market value .<q>joe : that 's going to take us to the next step which is the beginners millionaire matrix . now here 's what we want to do with the millionaire matrix and the goal of each system . we want to be able to make $ 5,000 per deal . we want to be able to do one deal per month . we want to be able to work 10 hours per month . that means 2.5 hours per week . we want to be able to have $ 200 residual income per deal . that residual income i 'm talking means every month you 're going to get $ 200 . we want to buy 10 % under market value ; it does n't have to be dramatically under market value because you 're buying on terms , and i 'm going to show you why that makes the difference ...<q>to read the rest of the transcript , click here : http://joecrumpblog.com/the-millionaire-matrix-how-to-become-a-millionaire-in-two-years-buying-one-house-per-month/ ? utm _ source = youtube & utm _ medium = endlink & utm _ campaign = youtube130808

http://www.drstrings.com here 's my quick change method for restringing your acoustic guitar . i prefer dr brand strings , but you can use anything you want . i used a snark clip on headstock electronic tuner for the demonstration . the guitar is a circa 1948 gibson j-45 that i 've had for around 12 years now , and is my # 1 acoustic . it looks like its about to fall apart , but the tone is amazing . i shot this demo after realizing that many of my drinking buddies have purchased guitars for their kids the last few years , and have no idea how to string or tune it . kind of a public service ... plus , a chance to show off my my mad string changing skills . yep !

we ask ... where are the safety chains ? where is the battery back up ? the breakaway cable is hooked up wrong ? st rated tires not even mentioned !!!! we know what is needed to put a safety video together correctly along with our safety expert ! yet nobody has asked us !<q>home<q>news<q>new video promotes horse trailer safety<q>new video promotes horse trailer safety<q>20 july , 2012<q>a new video promoting the importance of horse trailer safety and maintenance ahead of this summer 's show season has been specially produced by south west-based rural insurance firm cornish mutual .<q>the short-film highlighting the potential issues around maintaining and towing boxes and trailers has been commissioned and launched by the company , which insures horse owners across cornwall , devon , somerset and dorset .<q>there are more than 216,000 horses in the south west and wales , according to the british equestrian trade association ( beta ) and each year cornish mutual deals with third party and horse insurance injury claims involving horseboxes and trailers .<q>last august , a cyclist in devon suffered broken bones and a number of cuts after he was involved in a crash with a horsebox on the a386 near plymouth and in april this year , a horsebox toppled over in an accident on the a30 near okehampton in devon .<q>the insurer is now raising awareness of the risks involved in transporting horses to help reduce the number of incidents and costly insurance claims which could be avoided .<q>naomi phillips , senior insurance inspector with cornish mutual in dorset and somerset is the presenter of the new video . she has five of her own horses and regularly takes part in regional and national dressage championships , travelling extensively across the country .<q>she says : " i 've ridden from a young age and been involved in breeding , showing , eventing and dressage for many years . if , like me , you 're a responsible owner , you 'll understand the importance of spending the time regularly maintaining and looking after your horsebox or trailer . sadly there is a small minority of people out there who simply do n't carry out standard and simple checks on their vehicles and this is when accidents are more likely to happen .<q>" general maintenance is fairly easy and can be done by you or by a mechanic quickly and cheaply . keeping your horsebox , lorry or trailer in the best condition possible will help avoid accidents , unnecessary costs and long-term damage . it is just as essential as looking after your stables - it ensures your horse 's safety , welfare and comfort , as well as the safety of you and your vehicle . "<q>the video and safety advice from cornish mutual has received the backing of the british horse society .<q>sheila hardy , senior executive ( safety ) , at the british horse society adds : " the british horse society would urge all trailer owners to undertake regular checks of their trailer to ensure that it is safe in every respect , particularly in relation to the floor , ramp and tyres . have an annual service on the trailer and also take out breakdown cover so that you know you have done everything you can to keep you , others on the road and most importantly , the horse you are transporting as safe as possible . do n't exceed the speed limit when you are towing , choose the correct towing vehicle for the trailer you are using and do n't over fill it ! be safe at all times when you are on the roads "<q>cornish mutual has also issued some general safety advice for horse owners :<q>like all vehicles , towed horseboxes and trailers should be checked before each journey to make sure they are safe - this should include oil , tyres , indicators , brakes and brake fluid . it is essential to make sure the hitching is secure - do this by ensuring the brake is off , the jockey wheel is raised and the breakaway cable is securely attached .<q>check the towing limit for your vehicle and ensure the combined weight of your trailer and horse does not exceed this . all trailers need to have the registration number of their towing vehicle clearly visible , so make sure it is correct and visibly attached .<q>keep the interior maintained and in good condition . clean out the rear of the horsebox and trailer , make sure there is enough food and water and ensure the horse is fastened securely before every journey . floors and walls should be in good condition and checked regularly to make sure they are not damp , mouldy or have insects on them .<q>make sure the horsebox or trailer is safely parked and preferably undercover , especially if you have a trailer , to stop the contents getting damp or damaged and to protect the exterior from wear .

this might seem like pretty basic information but it is important and often overlooked . if you have noisy brakes you might want to try this . also , if you feel your brake performance is n't as good as it could be this might be something you could try . it 's also a good idea to do this to your vehicle every so often to make sure things are working as they should . this can prevent sticking caliper slides as well as the noise i mentioned . the honda service interval is about every 30,000 miles . i think that 's a good number to start with for servicing brakes .<q>here are some useful links for you .<q>silicone paste : http://www.jbtoolsales.com/3m-08946-silicone-paste-8-oz/#oid=1002_1<q>anti sieze : http://www.jbtoolsales.com/3m-08945-brake-lube-anti-seize/#oid=1002_1<q>pry bar set : http://www.jbtoolsales.com/performance-tool-1911-3-pc-pry-bar-set-8-12-18/#oid=1002_1<q>safety glasses : http://www.jbtoolsales.com/gateway-safety-4675-amber-temple-amber-lens-safety-glasses/#oid=1002_1<q>disc brake pad replacement video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laviogxzeuk<q>replacing rear disc brake pads : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kf8c4qxu-a<q>brake caliper replacement : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uqtgygd0mk<q>how to replace brake fluid : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5o_pbc8r2e<q>discussion about this video : http://www.ericthecarguy.com/kunena/18-the-ericthecarguy-video-forum/48302-disc-brake-service-basics#80630<q>the best place for answers to your automotive questions : http://www.ericthecarguy.com<q>facebook : https://www.facebook.com/ericthecarguy?fref=ts<q>twitter : https://twitter.com/ericthecarguy<q>google + : https://plus.google.com/100195180196698058780/posts<q>information on premium membership : https://www.ericthecarguy.com/premium-content-streaming-etcg-content<q>stay dirty<q>etcg<q>due to factors beyond the control of ericthecarguy , it can not guarantee against unauthorized modifications of this information , or improper use of this information . ericthecarguy assumes no liability for property damage or injury incurred as a result of any of the information contained in this video . ericthecarguy recommends safe practices when working with power tools , automotive lifts , lifting tools , jack stands , electrical equipment , blunt instruments , chemicals , lubricants , or any other tools or equipment seen or implied in this video . due to factors beyond the control of ericthecarguy , no information contained in this video shall create any express or implied warranty or guarantee of any particular result . any injury , damage or loss that may result from improper use of these tools , equipment , or the information contained in this video is the sole responsibility of the user and not ericthecarguy .
link to full article here : http://fourandhalf.com/property-management-marketing-ideas-divide-conquer-strategy/<q>our website : http://fourandhalf.com<q>today we are going to borrow a lesson from the ` art of war ' by sun tzu to help your property management business thrive if you service a competitive area . say your property management company is in sacramento , los angeles , denver , san antonio , or any of the other big metro areas . in a perfect world , it would be best for your company to have a physical presence in the center of one of those big metro areas that you service . however , your time and effort can be better spent for your business by focusing on the smaller markets surrounding those major cities .<q>having big audacious goals can deplete your resources by giving you little to no results in return - not getting enough leads , not making as much traction on google 's ranking , and not getting the visibility you desire , can leave your property management company in trouble .<q>no matter how hard you work , you may just be like sisyphus , pushing his boulder up the hill . in our blog for today , we 'll explain the reasons why you may not rank as high , and give you a strategy to build your business without focusing all your energy on the overwhelming task of getting your website in front of thousands and competing with hundreds . ladies and gentlemen , we introduce the divide and conquer strategy .<q>major metro areas and property management competition<q>let 's use sacramento as an example . there are 2,400 monthly online searches for sacramento property management . that 's great , but there are about 150 property management companies competing for the first page of google , or the top 10 positions . it 's tough to get in there , and usually the top-ranking companies are businesses that manage over a thousand units , or companies that have been in business for 20 or 30 years . these companies have lots of reviews and activity on their websites . on the surface , the amount of searches is a great sign , but the multitude of companies in that specific service area is an uphill battle for a new company - one not worth fighting .<q>google 's ranking formula<q>google changes their ranking formula all the time , but two things are consistently important in their algorithm :<q>how to implement the divide and conquer strategy<q>create city-specific blog content on your website - this does not mean you should describe the flowers and the gardens in the area . talk about investment property how-to tips in your town . make it property management specific and teach your trade to local people .<q>your website content must reflect your strategy - elk grove property management needs to be shown everywhere for your company . have it on your facebook , google business page , yelp page , etc. everything must say elk grove property management so google gets the signal that you do property management in elk grove .<q>reputation and reviews are critical - focus your work on asking happy customers to speak on your behalf . if they do n't use the name of your chosen city in their review , leave them a response thanking them , and mention the town .<q>finally , get out of your office and do a bit of networking . connect with people . look for a rental housing association in elk grove , and become a member . join the chamber of commerce and the local toastmasters . be known as an expert in the area of property management and investment properties . people like that are hard to find , and people will want to work with you . all of that networking will pay big dividends , especially if those organizations add a link to your website . that will help you rank faster in elk grove property management . become a leader in elk grove , and with those 260 searches , you will be able to command half of them .<q>if you 'd like to check out some examples of how some property management companies we work with have done this successfully , check out the following :<q>estey real estate in benicia , ca . eric hoglund and candi swanson have done an amazing job of becoming part of that community .<q>t.j. guyer in chehalis , washington . fred lofgren dominates the small washington market because his is the only company it makes sense to hire .<q>navy to navy in jacksonville , florida . mario gonzales does some amazing things and his angle is actually not location-based . instead , he specializes in military rentals ; his mission is to help veterans get to the right properties . his strategy follows a clear and concise goal .<q>divide and conquer needs to be your next move as a small business . if you have any questions about this blog or how we can help , please contact us at fourandhalf .

if your intermatic pool timer has stopped working , swapping it out is pretty easy . here i show you how to change a t101 120 volt model . if at any time you feel like it is too dangerous or you are unsure call a pool service tech or an electrician . but as you can see from the video this is pretty easy .<q>website : http://www.swimmingpoollearning.com/<q>youtube video index -- a list of all of my videos : http://poolmandave.blogspot.com/2014/03/swimming-pool-tips-reviews-how-to-video.html<q>before you change it out , test it by replacing the " on " and " off " trippers . that maybe all that it needs as those wear out and it appears the timer is n't working . if you change those and the timer still is not working then it is probably bad .<q>one thing to note is to make sure the power is completely off at the main breaker . a kill switch or a sub panel may not turn off the power to the timer completely . so make sure all power is off from the main breaker .<q>i like to mark the wires with tape as i do this job as not to lose track and make a wiring mistake . if you wire the timer incorrectly it wo n't work and may short out the breaker . so this is an important and crucial step .<q>then it is just a matter of swapping out the wires for each wire set . pretty easy . on this 120 v timer there is just one neutral white wire , one line wire and one load wire . if you are changing timer mechanism from another brand like g.e. or paragon timer make sure you line up the load and line wires correctly . refer to the schematic inside the old timer so you know which wires are which . you know that the intermatic wire order so it is just a matter of matching the wires up as the other timer may not have the wires all in the same location as the intermatic one here .<q>you can simply buy the timer mechanism without the box if you are not replacing the box or if it goes in a panel like the one in the video . this one was held in by torx star shaped screws but an allen wrench worked fine . at the end of the video i show you how to get the timer out of a box type set up .<q>related videos :<q>intermatic pool timer , tips & troubleshooting : http://youtu.be/p7ioh_plh2g<q>how to replace an intermatic t104m 240v ( 208 277 v ) pool timer : http://youtu.be/mpgicvcu7go<q>mrdgvb1 social media links :<q>google + : https://plus.google.com/+mrdgvb1/posts<q>blogger : http://poolmandave.blogspot.com/<q>facebook : https://www.facebook.com/pages/youtube-mrdgvb1/381257741926763?ref=hl<q>for a more tips and troubleshooting on your cleaner click here for that playlist

http://crosstrainingenduro.com http://tractionerag.com<q>just one of 80 free enduro training vids with traction erag , bunny hops and gap jumping are useful for clearing unexpected ruts , ditches and small creeks . learn how to ride dirt bikes using dirt bike techniques and enduro skills - just like the top dirt riders . this is an advanced enduro technique used by the world 's top extreme enduro and endurocross riders - taddy blasuziak , jonny walker and graham jarvis .<q>visit our youtube channel and subscribe here : https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucjavmhgp0h1aeky8vtejpjg<q>the bunny hop is a trials move where riders can leap the bike in the air on level ground and land some distance away . this can be adapted to allow a dirt bike to clear ditches and ruts even where there is no bump or rise to provide a take off point .<q>just before you reach the ditch , go through the usual steps for a wheelie . jump on the footpegs to compress the suspension , then as the suspension rebounds apply throttle and pull back on the bars . just before the rear wheel starts to clear the ditch , back off on the throttle and de-weight the footpegs to encourage the rear wheel to come up . remember to read traction erag too .<q>with good timing and luck you should at least get the front wheel over , and momentum should ensure that the rear wheel comes up and over the opposite side of the ditch .<q>using the clutch<q>one way to get some extra lift is with the zap technique we have already covered in our log hopping technique . try dropping the clutch at the critical point to get extra acceleration . this can be particularly useful on smaller capacity bikes as you are storing extra energy in the flywheel - trials bikes can do some incredible leaps into the air from a stand still using the zap . remember to keep your rear brake covered in case you overdo it and the bike starts to flip .<q>using a kicker<q>you need every bit of help you can get , so look for a " kicker " . in trials , this is small rock , log , bump or ledge that can be used as a launch point for your bike . it is very useful for jumping ditches as if you lift the front wheel high enough , keeping power on as the rear wheel hits the kicker will ensure your bike gains plenty of altitude for the crossing . try practicing with a suitable kicker - just make sure it 's not likely to move and deflect the front wheel . a kicker does n't need to be big - even a one inch high ledge can make a big difference .<q>start with a nice shallow ditch so that you ca n't get into trouble . progress to deeper gullies , ruts and ditches as you gain confidence .<q>#howtoridedirtbikes #crosstrainingenduroskills #howtoride #enduro #tractionerag #crosstrainingenduro
burns can heals in different ways , we classify them depending on the area involved at large areas involved of small areas involved and depending on the depth which is involved , that is a first degree burn where only the top layer of the skin is involved , second degree burn where the top two layers of the skin are involved and third degree burns where the areas below the skin like fat , muscle , tendons etc. are involved . so if you have first degree burn it heals only with the dark mark or whitish mark called as pigmentation or hyper pigmentation . if it 's a second degree burn it heals with a scar , sometimes these scars there are hard and they called as hypertrophic scars . third degree burns heal with largest scars and then they develop something called as contractures . contracture in limits movement for example if a person develops up an burn above the elbow area and developer contraction his hand is permanently in a position . so at that would require plastic surgery to release that contracture , so that he is able to again in the full moment . now coming to burn marks , burn marks are commonly dealt with by dermatologist , very superficial burn leave pigmented marks which is always there one in about 6 months to 1 years or if a person wants quick results we can give them depigment creams or do procedures like chemical peels which peel of the dead skin and make new skin to grow faster . if they develop something called as hypertrophic scar which are thick scars present on the skin , we give them certain injection into the scar to make it soft and come back to the level of the skin , these injections a given once in a month , 2 or 3 times in general but some patients my requirement more sessions . there are the procedures like lasers like a carbon dioxide laser or pulse light laser or a machine known as ipl in case of very red mark to reduce the redness of the marks . the best person to judge and how to treat it would be either a dermatologist or plastic surgeon . in case of very severe burns a plastic surgeon would be the ideal person to help you treat burns and their marks .

tune your guitar to eb tuning using a capo . put the capo on the first fret , and tune your guitar to standard or regular tuning , take off the capo and , voilà , your guitar is tuned to eb tuning , or in other words a tuning 1/2 step down from standard tuning .<q>there is a small problem . usually a guitar that is tuned in this way is a little out of tune when the capo is taken off , so re-tune your guitar at this point . just fine tune the altered notes to make sure your guitar is perfectly in tune ! have fun with the eb tuning .<q>after doing a search at ulimate-guitar i found this thread and these comments about who plays/played in eb tuning . i love reading these comments :<q>most grunge and 90s rock bands played in e flat , especially alice in chains and the smashing pumpkins .<q>most weezer songs are in e flat as well . jimi hendrix played in it a lot too .<q>green day did for a while , at least on dookie .<q>i believe van halen did at some point as well .<q>stevie ray vaughan used it alot/always .<q>coheed and cambria does it on their third album .<q>slayer , metallica on load and reload i believe were in flat . cannibal corpse on some songs too .<q>metallica used e-flat from reload to s & m.<q>pantera used e-flat on vulgar display of power .<q>slayer , candlemass , cannibal corpse .<q>tool , but that 's not much . at least on parabola .<q>ccr uses it in quite a few songs<q>not tool , they tune drop d 95 % of the time . saxon do on some of their older stuff and all their new stuff , van halen do , disturbed do on perfect insanity , maybe some others , black sabbath do on most things from heaven and hell on , megadeth on youthanasia album , nirvana on in utero and that acoustic album , and a lot of ozzy osbourne . oh yeah , yngwie malmsteen does too .<q>rise against does/did for a couple of their albums . they alternate between e flat and drop d<q>smashing pumpkins , afi , slaves to gravity , muse ( some of the new songs live ) , lostalone ... there 's more ... ... oh , and me .<q>ac/dc did on their first two or so albums on songs like for example whole lotta rosie , etc. .<q>morbid angel<q>protest the hero , afi , older kalmah .<q>wow , i really did n't think anyone else knew about lostalone<q>alter bidge use it on some songs . and also a fair amount of their songs are in e-flat but with the e droped to a b.<q>sonata arctica , all their songs are in eb tuning .<q>extreme use e flat , if i 'm not mistaken .<q>sikth and protest the hero<q>most grunge and 90s rock bands played in e flat , especially alice in chains and the smashing pumpkins .<q>most weezer songs are in e flat as well . jimi hendrix played in it a lot too .<q>fixed<q>kamelot<q>did n't yngwie malmsteen use it ? or am i imagining things again ?<q>x japan !<q>there you go . a list of bands that have used or do use eb tuning . i could n't have come up with it myself . a big " thank you " to all contributors .<q>your support is always welcome and appreciated :<q>support me or take lessons :<q>https://www.patreon.com/quail_studios<q>products i use and recommend : https://www.amazon.com/shop/quailstudiosguitar<q>follow me :<q>https://www.instagram.com/halstead_qst/<q>twitter :<q>https://twitter.com/hal_stead<q>gear<q>guitars :<q>blueridge br-73<q>yamaha 120 sd<q>ibanez andorra classical 2862<q>baby taylor<q>ukulele kala ka -- cg<q>tuners :<q>polytune clip<q>tuning apps -- cleartune , istrobosoft , n-track tuner<q>keyboards :<q>yamaha p22 acoustic piano<q>yamaha cp33 electric piano<q>amps :<q>crate gfx 15 w/dsp<q>effects :<q>tc electronic hall of fame 2<q>tc electronic ditto x2 looper pedal<q>cameras :<q>canon 70d<q>apple iphone se 64gb<q>sound recorder :<q>roland r-26<q>daw<q>reaper<q>video editor :<q>movie studio platinum 14<q>sound editors<q>sound forge 10 & 12<q>music notation software :<q>finale 25<q>playlists :<q>sacred sunday - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plhi97que-w-kgvdigzqr6wkqi0ur44d5u<q>mail monday - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plhi97que-w-la_-oegai2y_5macb1hl-o<q>advanced tuesday - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plhi97que-w-i6zbumarm3h2stlyj23xr0<q>beginner wednesday - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plhi97que-w-kumxmrffvfvvcd-9x_qihc<q>theory thursday - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plhi97que-w-iqofghx06pplzom16a81z7<q>fun friday - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plhi97que-w -<q>isfrejrd1d4whcem5nkpx _<q>song saturday - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plhi97que-w-lsyba903p6trpbxl0ptmb -<q>other playlists :<q>simple open position chords https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plhi97que-w-kbcc2enulwpylascusvtl6<q>songs with simple melodies https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plhi97que-w-kkq5_f2lqulqya8qunsits<q>video guitar lessons https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plhi97que-w-kv4nmkf6gy7l6r8iop4hcr<q>cover songs - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plhi97que-w-kj5wzuictcqt4rnpdf1lrr<q>exit music - standing stone written and played by eric blood - bass and vocals , hal stead - acoustic guitar , and zach reinhard - cajon . hal and zach are just along for the ride , eric is the real mastermind behind this song .<q>take care ,<q>hal stead
a duct tape boot is often used to cover a horse 's foot that has a sole abscess , bruise or wound to the sole . at times , a vet or farrier might create a hole in the sole to promote drainage of an abscess . a bandage is applied to keep the sole clean and dry , and possibly maintain contact between the wound and an antiseptic or poultice . how long the hoof should be bandaged depends on a number of factors and should be determined by your vet . there are a variety of commercial hoof covers and boots that are durable and convenient , but costly . being able to construct a foot bandage out of duct tape is a valuable and simple skill . thank you , dr. riddick for sharing your expertise with us !

( i will usually find one diaper that has a new stain or smudge ) grab the diaper or diapers that you have set aside and rub a little bit of oxiclean and hot water on them . if the stains have set in , soak it in your sink or a tub for an hour or two . after your spot cleaning or soaking , toss the diaper into your diaper pail for the next laundry day . this is a quick and easy way that i keep all of my cloth diapers spotless !<q>monthly - cleaning cloth diapers :<q>rinse and wash your stained diapers on a light cycle to quickly get them clean . then proceed to rub the stained areas with oxiclean and dawn dish soap . proceed to soak them in your washing machine ( or bath tub ) and add a couple scoops of oxiclean . add more scoops if you have a lot of diapers or inserts . after they have soaked , wash them on your normal cycle . you can also add half a cup of vinegar in place of a softener to help rid your diapers of odors .<q>before you sell - cleaning cloth diapers<q>stains may or may not be an issue with you . some people will only remove stains when they are pretty bad or they will wait until they are ready to sell their diapers . if that is the case then you will want to follow the steps in my video below to get them looking brand new again . that way , you make the most bang for your buck when you are ready to list them for sale ! please note , the stains will be a lot harder to remove if you do n't spray your cloth diapers or spot clean them from time to time .<q>how to get stains out of cloth diapers<q>https://youtu.be/bfkiowqflaw

things i forgot to say :<q>* plastic canvas can be glued over a cut hole for your ventilation , in place of window screening . it 's just as sturdy , cheaper , and can be cleaned easier .<q>* a plastic food storage container with an access hole cut in the lid or one side or even one side cut completely off , is a great place to put damp moss , or the cheap alternative moist paper towels , in for a humid hide to help reptiles shed . to make it fit your theme , just hot glue construction paper on the outside .<q>* if you have a very large animal to house , it can be cheaper to hand build your own terrarium out of wood if you ca n't find a secure lidded plastic container that 's big enough . use the cheapest wood ( do n't use any wood from evergreen trees as they contain a natural insect repellent that can cause respiratory problems and no flake or compresses saw dust board/wood either ) available ( like ply wood ) and use the thinnest cuts available . use heavy grade rubber coated chicken wire for screened areas instead of metal screening , as this tends to be cheaper . the more wood you have to use the more building a terrarium will cost so do n't get too fancy . use leftover pieces of wood to make climbing areas , ramps , hides , etc inside the cage . research to see what terrarium building methods different people have used successfully for their various animals . now building your own terrarium allows you to have whatever size and shape you need to fit your house and you can build in your own climbing areas for your pet . so have fun and it may be worth your while to build your own terrarium even if you 're not doing so to save money .<q>* paper and fabric towels make great substrates . paper towels come w / different things printed on them and towels come in all kinds of colors to match any theme . they 're easy to clean ( swap out paper towels for fresh or towels you just hand wash w/o detergent or you can just shake them off outside for a quick spot cleaning ) . eco earth is a cheap substrate you can buy for any type of environment . it holds moisture well for pets that need humidity or it can be used dry for desert dwellers . you can plant live plants in it and it 's made from natural recycled materials , coconut shell/husk . it 's usually cheaper than bark substrates or sand and poop can be easily shifted/scooped out of it to extend the life of the substrate . if you really want sand , you can pick some up at a garden center cheaper than at a pet store but it does n't come in any colors there and you have to make sure it was made chemical free and stored away from chemicals . bake it in the oven in a disposable tin pan at 250 degrees , like i said to do w / wood , before using it . rinsing it out w / water before baking would n't be a bad idea either to check for twigs in it and to get out the sand dust .<q>* clay gardening pots make great cheap , attractive hides and they come in a variety of sizes to meet any pet 's requirements . you can also get ones that are painted different colors or have a design on them .<q>* water bottle caps with the connector pieces filed down make great dishes for small pets like insects . lids from glass sauce jars are great for somewhat larger pets . you can also cut down any cleaned out plastic container food came in or use a food storage container . you can often buy stainless steel pet dishes for cats/dogs cheaper than you can the dishes sold for reptiles . plastic dishes made for human use are another cheap alternative and to add weight to them to prevent tipping just put a sanitized ( bake it ) large rock in the bottom or glue weights to each of the four sides ( across from each other ) of the bowel 's top or across the bottom to balance the dish . stoneware crock/casserole dishes make excellent weighted pet dishes for snakes , but are pricey unless you can pick some up at a thrift shop or yard sale .<q>* for many pets an appropriate wattage home light bulb will provide enough heat as a store bought pet bulb . a home bulb will need to be replaced more often , however . you can get energy saving light bulbs ( these do n't give off as much heat though as a normal incandescent bulb but they do last longer w/o burning out ) and i found my anole favored the more natural looking light given off by a halogen bulb . be sure to temperature check the hot spot often until you find what wattage and type of home light bulb you need to achieve the right temperature . you can also buy colored party bulbs in a home lighting section to use as a night time bulb . human electric hot pads are a great alternative to under the tank heaters , only if it will be used only at night . if you want to leave it on all day as your only/main heat source , you 'll have to buy a reptile under the tank heater or gardening ( flex watt ) heat tape .

here you can see colorful , blinking diwali lamps . these lamps are readymade -- perhaps made in china but you could buy some leds and 3-volt button cells and make them yourself . the leds have two legs -- the longer one is positive and the shorter one is negative . the led should be attached correctly to the battery otherwise it will not light up . this as you can see is the correct orientation . these lamp holders can be salvaged from old paper cups or plastic bottles . this readymade holder has a slit which houses and stands the led vertically . on placing the led correctly it will light up . these leds have a built in mechanism to blink . you can decorate your lamps by filling them with colored sand . this diwali we must not light crackers but burn our prejudices and biases . we must respect all life and pray for peace on earth .<q>this work is supported by iucaa ( www.iucaa.in ) and tata trust ( http://www.tatatrusts.org/ ) and ( www.tata.com/aboutus/sub_index/tata-trusts )<q>tata trust : education is one of the key focus areas for tata trusts , aiming towards enabling access of quality education to the underprivileged population in india . to facilitate quality in teaching and learning of science education through workshops , capacity building and resource creation , tata trusts have been supporting muktangan vigyan shodhika ( mvs ) , iucaa 's children 's science centre , since inception . to know more about other initiatives of tata trusts , please visit www.tatatrusts.org<q>credits : , ashok rupner , manish jain , pradnya pujari , shivaji mane , jyoti hiremath , arvind gupta , gunjan rupner , gargi rupner

i 've finished making the doors for the upper cabinets in my kitchen , and it 's time to sand them . and sanding is as important as the rest of the steps involved when making something from wood , if you want professional looking results .<q>since i will be finishing these with clear water based polyurethane , i do n't have to be as careful as i would if these were going to be stained . stain magnifies scratches and defects that generally do n't show with a clear finish , so extra time need to go into the sanding .<q>i used my ultimate sanding block :<q>https://ibuildit.ca/projects/ultimate-sanding-block/<q>and my flat sanding file :<q>https://ibuildit.ca/projects/wood-shaping-files/<q>along with my random orbit sander with a 220 grit disk to sand and level the faces of the doors .<q>notice i 'm sanding on something soft that wo n't mark the wood . i have an old towel on a piece of foam rubber gym floor mat .<q>a router can be used to either chamfer or round over the edge , but again can result in tear out or burning . the safest route is to just sand it , starting with coarse grit paper and move up to a finer grit .<q>you can help support the work i do in making these videos :<q>project plans for sale : https://ibuildit.ca/plans/<q>support this channel on patreon :<q>https://www.patreon.com/user?u=865843&ty=h<q>my main channel :<q>https://www.youtube.com/user/jpheisz<q>my home reno channel :<q>https://www.youtube.com/c/ibuildithome<q>my " scrap bin " channel :<q>https://www.youtube.com/c/ibuilditscrapbin<q>#ibuildit<q>website : https://ibuildit.ca/<q>facebook : https://www.facebook.com/i-build-it-258048014240900/<q>instagram : https://www.instagram.com/i_build_it.ca/

http://www.b2review.com/growing-jerusalem-artichoke-helianthus-tuberosus-in-january/ i was first introduced to jerusalem artichokes from my " substitute " grandma lois pratt who has since passed . they did not seem very impressive at the time but after witnessing how easy and fast they grow , i would suggest them to any novice gardener in a similar environment .<q>the tubers of the " sunchoke " as they are also called have been said to have inulin as the carbohydrate and is high in potassium ( 650 mg potassium in 1 cup ! ) . it would seem this along with many other nutrients make it a great addition to your diet however if you do not keep adding organic compost to the soil or replant the tuber the stems will still grow and may take over your garden like a weed !<q>growing jerusalem artichoke in january<q>i planted the jerusalem artichokes just a month ago and they are growing very well in january ! i ordered my tubers online but i would suggest finding a friend with them growing already because there will inevitably be extra to give away . while many of the other plants are dormant these " sunchokes " are growing tall and strong through the december frost and short days in january .<q>i planted these in containers so that i can easily control where they grow and can maintain quality soil with organic compost that i have created from kitchen scraps and leaves from the yard . i suggest making sure you soil does not contain other contaminates since the tubers that you will be eating are growing directly in the soil . i do suggest growing these as a novice gardener and i hope you enjoy eating them as well !
rolling and tipping paint can be hard to get right . in this video we have called on boat painting pro , hillary , from the total boat tech team . with proper preparation and lots of patience and the right method , your topside paint job will look like it was sprayed on by pros in a paint booth .<q>the totalboat wet edge topside paint is a great paint for topside use and also for cabin tops , cockpit and bulkheads and even down below . get your wetedge paint at totalboat.com and choose from 20 colors to make your boat looks its best .<q>video note : we painted the entire hull of this sailing dinghy . both topsides and the " bottom . " this is acceptable use of topside paint because the boat will never be left in the water when not in use - discounting any need for an antifouling bottom paint .<q>wet edge topside paint should not be used on boat 's bottoms if the boat will remain in the water unused for any period of time .<q>thanks for watching .

memorial day is just around the corner and i am intent to have my pool to 80 degrees f if the sun cooperates . i live in williamsburg virginia , and it was about 80 degrees outside temperature today with full sun hitting the deck . this setup is only temporary to warm up the pool from its winter hibernation . the tube is a 6mil black food-safe polyethylene 1000 feet long . do n't know how long it will last , and pinholes quickly formed when i kinked it during unrolling , but it was only $ 50 . i realize now that i should probably space the coils out so the deck can see the sun and transfer heat to the individual runs instead of the grouping .

continuous use steam room ceilings can be a challenging part of a steam room installation . this video shows you two different options to create a fully waterproof , vapor tight steam continuous use steam room ceiling . first things first , always follow all of the details provided in the schluter ® shower system handbook , as well as industry requirements during installation . the first option is to install kerdi-ds directly over cement backer board . the kerdi-ds is a waterproofing membrane that exceeds the perm rating to install in steam room application , without a vapor barrier . the kerdi-ds is installed in a simple thin-set mortar application . the membrane can be overlapped 2 inches between sheets , or kerdi-band can be used at these areas to ensure a fully waterproof envelope . another option is to install kerdi-board directly to metal studs . in commercial applications , the 5/8 " kerdi-board is appropriate . the kerdi-board is fastened to the studs using self-tapping metal screws and the kerdi-board washers . once the kerdi-board is installed , kerdi-ds is installed over the kerdi-board to meet the requirements for a steam room application . check out the video for all of the details !<q>for further information on our products please visit our website :<q>http://www.schluter.com<q>subscribe to our channel : http://www.youtube.com/schlutersystems1<q>facebook : https://www.facebook.com/schlutersystems
episode description :<q>unsure why every time naiane is present , everything starts to revolve around food , haha . this girl eats way more than i do and has a greater affinity for junk food than i.<q>in this episode , i talk of the qualitative aspects of the stock market 's price discovery while waiting on the shake shack buzzer to vibrate ! it is a topic that could spur a discussion that is many hours in length ! but the goal of these short video is to introduce both concrete and abstract philosophical elements that are so evident in so many facets of our interactions , with the markets merely being one of them . perhaps it is obvious to many that my optics for the market really derives from my own unique romanticism for life and developing my own framework of understanding that is rarely limited to the functionality of the markets - rather , my heartfelt belief is that the often the things you witness and experience in the markets are the manifestation of the things you often witness in life - just dressed differently . to be able to reduce and make sense of things , as to continuously extend the tapestry of life & markets , and as you see the two intertwine further , you hopeless fall in love with that process .<q>my desire to make the videos stem from my promise to the students : to spark curiosity in a manner of delivery that differs from the insipid nature of the sterile public school classrooms . i 'm still tweaking and constantly changing the forms of delivery in every episode . but this " price discovery " of my own process , is also the most fun aspect of it all , just as it is for the markets .<q>#trading #wallstreet #vlog #hedgefund #stocks #forex #commodities #globalmacro #options #models #fashionmodel #miamibeach #investing #photoshoot #foodie<q>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<q>channel description :<q>once youngest global-macro trader and portfolio manager at a $ 20 billion hedge fund , and a macroeconomics & political science teacher .<q>i want to marry the applicable real-world optics and actionable mechanics of my background that allowed so many of my students to reimagine their world .<q>the vision is to compose a short weekly vlog that takes the viewers on a journey across many subjects and events around the world within those short minutes .<q>the second parallel journey to the first one above , is a financial one where together we wrestle with the task of making money simply armed with passion for wanting to deconstruct the very world we breathe within and perpetually approach it with wonder .<q>i want my efforts to give birth to something special , one that always remain pure midst of many predatory things that only rob your time and money . i want my efforts to be a positive force to many when the opposite seems to sometimes overwhelm .<q>instagram : @hedgefunddropout

for more information such as a cutlist and materials used visit : http://www.simplyeasydiy.com/2014/06/diy-small-backyard-chicken-coop.html<q>what goes into designing a chicken coop ? it depends on your needs . our needs were the following :<q>1 . must be small and accommodate 2 to 4 chickens .<q>2 . easy set up and take down .<q>3 . must double as a transport carrier .<q>4 . must have a large access so it can be cleaned easily .<q>most of the following information can probably be filed under the " no brainer " category for most . of course if you do n't know it then it is n't a " no brainer " , so here goes :<q>1 . as is the case with many small and mobile chicken coop designs , sacrifices have to be made . usually in the form of security . this one is no different .<q>2 . this chicken coop is designed with an urban setting in mind .<q>3 . predators such as a fox , coyote or even dogs can dig underneath the run area . you could try to combat this by extending the wire completely underneath the base and run area . usually the wire is dug into the ground 6 to 12 inches but then the coop ceases to be mobile .<q>4 . generally speaking chickens are only inside the coop at night and when laying eggs . with that in mind i estimate the size of this coop can accommodate up to 4 chickens . however , the run area depicted in the video is way to small for four chickens . we let our chickens run the entire backyard during the day and are only enclosed in the run area when we are away . if you intended to keep 4 chickens enclosed in a run i would recommend doubling if not tripling the run area you see in the video . chickens get bored just like you and me . if that happens and their space is to small , they will start to peck each other , sometimes to death . this is why their beaks are often times cut off in commercial operations .<q>5 . be kind to your chickens and they will be kind to you . if you care for them , they will care for you and your family . they will provide not just nutritious eggs but also quality entertainment .<q>much better than whatever junk is on cable tv these days .<q>----- music by -----<q>" world music " by jason farnham<q>downloaded from the youtube music library
do you watch tv ? or play videogames , or browse facebook for hours at a time , or engage in other somewhat addictive behavior ? do you do it so much that it subtracts from your life experience ? and so sometimes you think you have to give it all up forever , or else ? but then you 're confused , because , why would you have to give up something you seem to enjoy so dearly ? the solution is the daily practice - once you have done your work , and engaged your potential for the day , you are free to do whatever your heart desires ! just do n't stay up too late ! [ wink ]<q>a daily practice is important because it gives you something solid to balance against when you feel the aching need to indulge your ravenous mind and senses . in other words : it gives you something to do besides just pretending you 're a child while you wait to die . many , maybe most people do n't feel like there is anything wrong with their routine : you work , you play . but some of us are so obsessed with the meaning of work and play and become so weighted down with thought that work becomes unthinkable and the mind is so heavy that play itself becomes work . there is hope : a daily practice can guide you to making sure you 're putting in the necessary work , which in turn frees your mind to enjoy play .<q>my daily practices : water , yoga , meditation , reading , writing and exercise . i had an opportunity to start doing this recently because i just moved into an apartment after living in a tent in the woods for a while .<q>what matter to you ? what are your intentions ? answers to these questions will guide you towards determining a personally effective daily practice . if you need some inspiration in determining your intentions , watch my last video . i intend to live slowly , so my daily practice includes water , meditation and yoga . i intend to make youtube videos and write books , so my daily practice includes as well reading and writing . other people have other intentions ; for instance , if you intend to be a magician , your daily practice should include magic tricks . the beautiful thing is , once the daily practices are finished , i am free to let my mind wander !<q>too long i was slamming back and forth like a box of fragile goods loose on a cargo ship during a hurricane : i would first insist that i would do nothing but work for the rest of my life , until i realized that the reason i was working was to build an eternal playtime , at which point i would decide to merely begin the playtime immediately , and constant indulgence would follow for some overextended time thereafter . no longer , as i intend to engage in daily practice that instills a balance in my life of getting the work finished , and still having space for play .<q>if you flex your muscles too long , at some point you have to let go , and take prolonged time to recover . on the other hand , if you never flex , you become weak . the daily practice is a smooth , balanced approach of flexing and releasing at a steady pace . after all , it 's no race to the finish , because what 's the finish ? death . but do n't get too upset about that , because you still have ample time left on earth . so , what is the balance between doing the work needed to truly live and the play needed to truly die ? a daily practice that engages your unique intentions and when finished , lets you have the mental space for taking off the leash and letting the wind carry you for playtime .<q>one final note : if you have no time to carry out a meaningful daily practice that aligns with your heartfelt intentions , it may be time to realign your priorities , or , it could be an opportunity to delve deeper into understanding why you want to do what it is you want to do .<q>thanks for listening , have a great day !

nursing standard precautions and isolation precautions ( nursing ) review for the nclex exam . this review will cover standard precautions for infection control and transmission-based precautions ( also called isolation precautions ) such as contact , droplet , and airborne precautions . in addition , i will give you 3 isolation precaution mnemonics on how to remember droplet , contact , and airborne precautions . standard precautions are precautions we follow with every patient at all times because we do not know if the person has an infectious disease or not . this is to protect ourselves and other patients . standard precautions include : hand hygiene , wearing appropriate ppe ( personal protective equipment ) , injection safety , respiratory/cough etiquette , patient room placement , handling of patient laundry and equipment . isolation precautions are precautions we follow when we know or suspect a patient has an infectious disease . depending on the type of infectious disease the patient has we will place the patient in the appropriate precautions . for example , if a patient has pertussis ( whooping cough ) we will place the patient in droplet precautions . as the nurse , we would continue to follow standard precautions along with always wearing a surgical mask during patient contact . for a patient in airborne precautions , we would wear an n95 mask along with following standard precautions and place the patient in a special aiir room ( which is a negative pressure room ) . for a patient in contact precautions , we would always wear gloves and a gown during patient contact and follow standard precautions . please watch the video for details on what diseases are included with each precaution and the mnemonics to help you remember the material .<q>isolation precautions quiz : https://www.registerednursern.com/isolation-precautions-nclex-practice-quiz/<q>lecture notes : https://www.registerednursern.com/standard-and-isolation-precautions-nclex-review/<q>subscribe : http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=registerednursern<q>nursing school supplies : http://www.registerednursern.com/the-ultimate-list-of-nursing-medical-supplies-and-items-a-new-nurse-student-nurse-needs-to-buy/<q>nursing job search : http://www.registerednursern.com/nursing-career-help/<q>visit our website registerednursern.com for free quizzes , nursing care plans , salary information , job search , and much more : http://www.registerednursern.com<q>check out other videos : https://www.youtube.com/user/registerednursern/videos<q>all of our videos in a playlist : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pahhxt663pu&list=plqrdx7rrskfxmvercn4df0bad3ugeaqnk<q>popular playlists :<q>nclex reviews : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plqrdx7rrskfwtwcdmlhyx2uehofcicgo0<q>fluid & electrolytes : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plqrdx7rrskfwjsz9pl8l3q1dzdlxuzekv<q>nursing skills : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plqrdx7rrskfuhd_qqyebp0eab3uukhgkb<q>nursing school study tips : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plqrdx7rrskfwbo40qedmmamwmhjewc9ms<q>nursing school tips & questions " https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plqrdx7rrskfvqok-t1x5zmggqr3imby9m<q>teaching tutorials : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plqrdx7rrskfukw_dpjekn_y0lfkvnfyvf<q>types of nursing specialties : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plqrdx7rrskfw8drd72gufa5w7xdfoxarp<q>healthcare salary information : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plqrdx7rrskfvn0vmep59tx2biab_3qhdh<q>new nurse tips : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plqrdx7rrskfvtqh6lioad2zrouzx9gxzy<q>nursing career help : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plqrdx7rrskfvxjptwyvj2sx1k1587b_pj<q>ekg teaching tutorials : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plqrdx7rrskfu-a9utcli0toyrnj1n5snt<q>personality types : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plqrdx7rrskfu0qhnojj2jf4hw8ajaxbtm<q>dosage & calculations for nurses : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plqrdx7rrskfuydl0tzq0tc2-hllxlhnxq<q>diabetes health managment : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plqrdx7rrskfxtex17d7zc1efmwix-iis9

fake bellies - https://www.fakepregnantbelly.com/<q>hi , my husband and i bought a third trimester baby tummy from fakepregnantbelly.com and were surprised that it arrived in just a few days ! the feel and look of this belly is just so natural . the velcro strap is tight and holds my belly no matter what i do . we are in the middle of the adoption process and we hope everything will go just fine . i have already tried faking my pregnancy and it worked . i had such a great talk with one woman in the mall about what my 3rd trimester was like , she had no idea i was wearing my fake belly . i personally recommend this silicone baby bump because it is the most realistic i ever seen .
the bore boss is a bore cleaning system with a bronze brush and braided mop . however , it has a handle that helps to more easily pull the system through the bore . even more importantly is that it has its own built-in case that makes storing the system much more compact and keeps any oil and grime from getting on anything else .<q>ten different calibers will be initially available , and these will have a msrp of only $ 9.99 for each regardless of caliber . i 'm looking forward to trying these out and see if i can replace my box with something more compact .<q>https://goo.gl/m5xewr<q>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<q>check out ammoland.com for more reviews and breaking news !<q>ammoland shooting sports news , is the web 's leading shooting sports news service for the ammunition , firearms , shooting , hunting and conservation communities . we publish a constant stream of related news that is read by our 10,000 's daily readers on our website and through email , rss , social media and our many syndication partners .<q>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<q>please like and subscribe to get breaking firearms related news as well as reviews as soon as they come out !<q>you can also find us on :<q>facebook.com/ammoland/<q>instagram : @ammoland<q>twitter : @ammoland

https://www.etrailer.com/tv-install-brake-controller-2004-ford-explorer-90885.aspx<q>today on this 2004 ford explorer we 're going to install part number etbc7 we 're going to use this to install brake controller part number 90885 from tekonsha , the prodigy p2 brake control . so we 'll start off our install by installing a mounting bracket onto the hitch . now this bracket does not come with the kit and we 'll be using part number 18140 . now the bracket is a little on the short side , so we have to make it a little bit longer . what we 're going to do is just add a couple more holes to the end of the bracket .<q>we use a 7 pole bracket to locate our holes . then we 'll go ahead and drill it out and then attach it to our 7-pole bracket . then we 'll attach it to our hitch . before we install our 7-pole connector we 'll go ahead and take a few moments to connect our gray wire that comes with the kit up to our 7 pole connector . what we 'll do is wind these wires up in electric tape and leave out the leads that we 'll need later , such as the 4-pole , the brake wire , which is blue and our black wire which is for our 12 volt power supply .<q>then we 'll wrap up our purple and white wire . the white wire will be attached to the frame for ground while the purple wire is for reverse lights if it is ever needed . onto our black and blue wires . we 'll install the gray duplex cable , which has a black and white wire . we 'll peel away the gray sheet to reveal the wires and strip them back to make our connections .<q>we 'll go black to black and then white to blue . we 'll put some tape around those connectors , as well . next we 'll install the loom around the wires like this and then tape it up . with our 7-pole connector installed onto the bracket we 'll turn attention to the 4-pole . now we 'll have to remove the original 4-pole from its original bracket right behind the hitch and we 'll go ahead and make our connection .<q>to make the 4-poles go together we 're going to cut the sheath off the adapter side and then we can plug into the factory 4-pole harness . apply a little bit of electric grease on the inside to protect the connections and make it a permanent connection after that . with our 4-pole connected up we 'll go ahead and run our white wire with a ring terminal tot he body for ground . we 'll be using a number 14 self-tapping screw to accomplish this . then we 'll go ahead and take our gray cable and run it up to the front of the vehicle . we 'll make sure we 'll stay away from anything that 's moving , like the suspension , or anything hot , like the exhaust . we 'll go ahead and route this cable up through the engine compartment up to the battery . at this point we 'll go ahead and install the circuit breaker . with the cable ran up to the battery we 'll go ahead and run it past a little bit , maybe about 3 to 4 foot and then cut off the excess . our black wire in its sheath is going to be connected to the circuit breaker and then ran to the positive post of the battery . when we run our black wire through the circuit breaker we 'll run it from the end going out from the 7-pole , we 'll run it up to the silver post . then the copper post will go to our positive power supply . in this case we 're going to actually tap off the power supply going into the power junction box . and the white wire 's going to be , actually , ran back underneath the vehicle and up through a grommet to get to the inside . we 'll cut the grommet from the inside underneath the dashboard and then use a piece of air tube to stick through it to the outside towards the engine compartment . we 'll go back outside and pull the air tube up and connect it through our white wire with some electric tape , then pull it back into the vehicle from the inside . next we 'll route a piece of air tube over to the passenger si

i found out there was no output in my laptop 's battery after replacing the cells . i had to reset laptop battery 's protection circuit in order to make it work again . in many " how to recell laptop battery " tutorials , there is warning that battery might get bricked when cells are removed . i 've found that in many cases this kind of jump starting process can fix that .<q>i 've received feedback from multiple users saying this has worked for other brands too , not just ibm thinkpads . and i 've noticed the same thing . sometimes the switch is in positive side , but sometimes it has been in negative side ...<q>here is a blog post i wrote for this hack , telling you why i did this and how :<q>http://jaforeck.wordpress.com/2012/07/24/t40-recelling/<q>disclaimer : this is n't tutorial or " how-to " video . this video was made and published only to document my personal project . i take no responsibility if someone tries to replicate this .<q>few additions that are needed , according to the comments/pms :<q>- the resistor and fan are n't needed . they are there just to prove there is some kind of ouput .<q>- the internal switch can be in the negative side . in that case i would have needed to connect the jumper wire from negative side of the battery pack to the negative side ( - ) of the outputconnector , instead of positive sides .<q>- if the voltage of each cell is ~ 3v or more and this method does n't work , the problem is somewhere else ... most likely in the battery 's pcb .<q>if you liked the video , please show it and hit the like-button !<q>check out my other videos :<q>https://www.youtube.com/user/hugatry/videos<q>subscribe :<q>https://www.youtube.com/user/hugatry?sub_confirmation=1

shinto is one of the two major religions of japan ( the other is buddhism ) . shinto is often considered to be the native religion of japan , and is as old as japan itself . the name shinto means " the way of the gods . " shinto is a pantheistic religion , in which many thousands of major and minor gods are thought to exist . the japanese have built thousands of shrines ( jinja ) throughout the country to honor and worship these gods . some shrines are huge and are devoted to important deities . other shrines are small and may be easily missed when strolling along roads in the countryside .<q>shinto gods are called kami . kami are thought to have influence on human affairs , and for this reason many japanese make regular pilgrimage to community shrines in order to offer prayers to local kami . the act of prayer involves approaching the shrine structure , passing through the gate-like torii , cleansing the hands and mouth with water and possibly ascending stairs to the main entrance of the shrine . usually without entering the shrine the worshipper will throw some coins into a stone or wooden collection box and then rattle the suzu bell which is at the top of a long hemp rope . the worshiper grabs hold of the rope and shakes it back and forth causing the copper bell at the top to rattle . this is thought to get the attention of the shrine god . the worshipper then bows twice , claps his or her hands twice and then bows again . in addition , the worshipper may clasp their hands together in silent prayer . shintoism and buddhism have managed to find a comfortable coexistence in japan . evidence of this harmonious relationship is found in the fact that that most japanese are married in a shinto shrine , but buried by a buddhist priest .<q>--<q>welcome to the the japan shrine and temples blog . exploring japan 's spiritual infrastructure .<q>find us on youtube at the following url :<q>http://www.youtube.com/user/shrinesandtemples<q>please visit our blog at the following url :<q>http://shrinesandtemples.wordpress.com<q>follow us on twitter :<q>https://twitter.com/#!/shrinestemples<q>interested in talking with others about japan ?<q>please visit our forum at : http://softypapa.net

hello fellow youtubers ! this here is my first actual video that involves me in it . this video will teach you how to make a lightsaber with around thirty dollars to spend .<q>if there are any questions on anything that i may have missed during the recording , feel free to ask . i may sound as though i rushed during some spots , so i 'll explain here .<q>as you can tell , we decided to record this video outside in order to break the mold . it was a sunny/rainy day , but the issue we faced was this sunny patch was going to be the last one of the day , so we were short on time .<q>it did drizzle for a bit during the video as i point out . also , the person that is sniffling during the video is the cameraman , he was sick with something .<q>one thing i forgot to say was that the steel coupler was 3/4 inch diameter . like i said , i had to rush some stuff .<q>if anyone has any info on where to find special effects for movies like this , please let me know . we need some new things !<q>cast :<q>lightsaber assembler : alex k.<q>cameraman/editor : chris o.<q>sith : jeremy o.<q>editing software : lsmaker .
today chubby turner and i are visiting about the advantages ( find this complete video on the dennis moreland tack blog at https://www.dmtack.com/horse-might-perform-better-light-weight-bit-less/ ) of aluminum shanked bits http://bit.ly/2fmh1ky . aluminum shanks are lighter weight than steel shanks which helps to make the aluminum shanked bits milder than steel shanked bits . the lighter weight puts less pressure on the mouth compared to bits with steel shanks .<q>chubby is a cutting horse trainer from weatherford tx . he has been inducted into both the national cutting horse association ( ncha ) open rider hall of fame and member hall of fame . he is a multiple time ncha world champion and limited aged event champion and has won $ 2,500,000 .<q>follow along on the video as chubby explains when and why he likes to use a lightweight bit with aluminum shanks , or transition back to an aluminum shanked bit from a bit with steel shanks , on many of the horses he trains and shows . he 'll also explain why he likes these bits to have shanks that swivel so he can help direct a horse through a turn .<q>because you want your horse to continuously respond to the bit with the lightest cue on the reins , you may want use an aluminum shanked bit http://bit.ly/2fmh1ky . in addition to being useful on sensitive horses , aluminum shanked bits are good mild bits to use when you transition your colt from a snaffle . the wide flat shape of the shanks also helps to guide a horse 's nose in the direction of the turn during a direct rein pull . in addition , you can really pull a horse around with 2 hands with these bits without putting too much pressure on their mouths . they 're excellent for training horses to move on cattle .<q>the mouthpieces in my aluminum shanked bits are made of mild steel with copper strips inlaid in the steel . the copper tastes better to a horse than steel and will help promote salivation . even the most subtle cue on the reins will be transferred to the mouthpiece via the bit shanks if a horse 's mouth is moist . many horses can be ridden continuously in this bit .<q>dennis moreland tack makes balanced aluminum shanked bits with both 7 inch shanks http://bit.ly/2ubbvdo and 8 inch shanks http://bit.ly/2pyxeel . they are available with a variety of steel mouthpieces with copper strips to suit the individual horse 's needs . i also make a rubber mouthpiece for horses that need the ultimate in a mild bit . check the aluminum shanked bits out here : http://bit.ly/2fmh1ky . call or text 817-312-5305 or write to us at dmtack@vrfmail.com with any questions .<q>we 're a full line manufacturer of handmade tack and we 're here to help you !

how to identify bug bites and avoid health problems . with so many different insects that transmit all kinds of nasty diseases through their bites and stings , it 's really important to be able to identify your attacker . it might seem hard to know what exactly bit you with so many possible options but you 'll be able to protect yourself and know how to avoid serious health issues if you follow some simple tips we 've put together . our guide will make you an insect expert so you 'll be able to identify bee , wasp , tick , flea , lice , bed bugs bites and others .<q>timestamps<q>how to know a hornet stung you 1:01<q>how to identify a bee sting 1:50<q>how to find out if a wasp stung you 2:49<q>how to tell an ant bite from others 3:40<q>how to know it was a mosquito that bit you 4:35<q>how to tell if a tick bit you 5:35<q>how to identify a flea bite 6:27<q>how to identify a horse-fly bite 7:13<q>how to prevent lice bites 8:18<q>how to know bed bugs bit you 9:10<q>music :<q>geographer - idcidk<q>rondo brothers - magnum<q>https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music<q>summary<q>- when hornets sense danger , they get super aggressive and sting harder than bees . the stung area becomes red and severely swollen . sometimes blisters can even appear .<q>- in case you or someone nearby has been stung by a bee , you need to act fast . remove the stinger immediately if it 's broken off in your skin . the affected area gets red and swollen from the get-go .<q>- the area stung by wasps becomes red and swollen , the victim feels pain and burning , and terrible itching ensues a bit later . you might even be left with a bruise .<q>- ants keep a grip on you in order to pierce your skin with his stinger , making it one of the few ant species that actually stings . blisters appear on the stung spots that later turn into scars .<q>- mosquito bites look like swollen red spots about the size of a dime , and they usually appear on open areas of the body . mosquitoes bite where the skin is really thin because it 's easier to get to the blood vessels .<q>- ticks can easily relocate between humans and their pets . blood rises towards the upper layers of the skin around a tick bite , making the area appear reddish .<q>- flea bites are very painful , and the itch is even worse . fleas usually attack the legs and prey solely on sleeping people . one insect can bite several times , so the red spots they inflict are usually from 0.5 to 1 inch apart .<q>- unlike the common housefly , horse-flies bite painfully and drink human blood . at first , a small red spot appears no more than a millimeter wide . then it gets swollen and starts to itch .<q>- if you notice small red dots that look like a rash on your scalp , the back of your neck , and behind your ears , that means you 've got a case of head lice . keep yourself and your house clean , and wash your clothes regularly to keep lice away .<q>- bed bug bites are very close to each other and look like little dotted roads on the skin . they are more painful than those from mosquitoes , and they 're mostly noticed in the morning since these bugs hunt at night .<q>subscribe to bright side : https://goo.gl/rqtjzz<q>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<q>our social media :<q>facebook : https://www.facebook.com/brightside/<q>instagram : https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/<q>5-minute crafts youtube : https://www.goo.gl/8jvmuc<q>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<q>for more videos and articles visit :<q>http://www.brightside.me/

here is a little review about my 2 pairs of chanel ballets flats .<q>i purchased the first pair ( lambskin beige ) in april 2013 ( 450 € ) and the classic quilted ( calfskin black ) in april 2014 ( 485 € ) .<q>lambskin require more care , especially in light colors but i 've worn them quite a lot and they still look new . the tip is : store them in their box with the tissue after each use and be genuinely careful ( no rain or mud of course ) . and remember , the light ones are more luxurious to me because the sole is velvet rather than hard leather !<q>if you have any further question , just ask and i 'll be happy to help :)<q>http://instagram.com/miy_u<q>http://smileinthebrightstyle.blogspot.com

a mezuzah is a parchment scroll on which the shema , the biblical passage declaring the oneness of g-d , is handwritten by an expert scribe . the torah commands us to affix the mezuzah to every doorpost of our home as a constant reminder of our belief in g-d and his watchful care and protection over us .<q>but why every door ?<q>each room in our home has a specific purpose , houses certain activities , inspires particular moods or thoughts . our inner selves , too , are comprised of many seemingly disconnected roles , responsibilities , emotions -- even identities . we may sense a resulting feeling of fragmentation , a lack of direction and focus , which can drain our energy and zest for life .<q>the mezuzah reminds us that there is in fact a unifying force that binds together all of the disparate parts of our lives . that unifying force is our mission as jews to reveal g-d 's oneness in the world .<q>as we traverse the thresholds of our lives -- be they physical , intellectual , or emotional -- we remind ourselves of the words of the shema : " the l-rd is our g-d , the l-rd is one . " by infusing a g-dly awareness into everything we do , and by using our g-d-given tools to make the world a brighter , kinder , more g-dly place , we unite the fragments of our lives -- and of the world -- under the cosmic , divine calling of shema yisrael .<q>-<q>for more information , please visit : https://goo.gl/5rkfss<q>to find a location near you , visit : http://www.myrcsociety.com/index.php/locations<q>the rosh chodesh society • simple truths • lesson 2

computer for a family member ... decided to try something i have been thinking about for a while . case is antec three hundred two . enclosed the harddrive cage with aluminum sheet metal . used a non-ferrous blade to cut the metal . the antec three hundred two is well suited for this . has large volume for getting speaker response . has nice flat surfaces to put sheet metal on . internal volume was 0.179 cubic feet . speakers are tang band w3-881sj 3 " full range neodymium driver . amplifier is from parts express " tda7492 digital audio amplifier board 2x50w " part # 320-606 . the voltage booster is yuan-jing adjustable boost converter board . part # 320-6546 . initially the voltage level of the headphone was too high for the amplifier input and so i had to turn the volume way down . i used a voltage divider for a 4:1 ( 10.5 k to 2.5 k ) ratio and it did have just about exactly a 4x volume decrease in windows volume slider . i would probably go with a 5 or 6:1 ratio if doing it again . had horrible ground loop noise when the headphone plug was plugged into the back of the motherboard . was a little skeptical , but a $ 8 ground loop isolator ( 3.5 mm to 3.5 mm ) fixed it perfectly .

fish is purchased from dorian 's seafood market , 1580 york ave , new york , (212) 535-2256 . lily orders pike and whitefish ( approx 1 1/2 lbs ) . she does n't know the exact proportions , but it is one fish of each . they give her the fish off the bones and very finely chopped ( possibly ground ) . in a separate package they give her the bones as they are needed to make the broth .<q>put fish bones in a soup pot with enough water to almost cover . add salt , pepper , 1/4 cup sugar , and a half teaspoon of almond extract . simmer for an hour or so until you have a flavorful broth . remove bones and add sliced carrots .<q>in a large bowl , mix together chopped fish , one large onion finely grated , 2 eggs , and a cup of matzo meal . blend well and then add 1 tsp salt , 1 tsp white pepper , and 1/2 tsp almond extract . set aside a bowl of water to dip your hands into as you form the balls , this will help prevent the fish mixture from sticking to your hands . form the mixture into balls about the size of a slightly flattened very large egg . ( the day we made them the mixture made 13 servings . ) as they are ready lower them into the broth that you have waiting on a low boil . reduce heat to a simmer and cover pot . let cook for half an hour .

i used common pvc pipe , a shower curtain , and some rope to create my own rear projection screen for home use and the occasional special events . i misspoke a few times during the video . i 'm not working with a script . the drape set are two 72 inch wide fabric shower curtains . i used two to keep " pleats " when both are drawn together . it looks better that way .<q>it works equally well as a front projection screen ; especially when the black curtains are drawn . i think it helps minimize the light that passes through the screen material from illuminating the area in back of the screen . that light could detract from the picture quality . it also keeps the area in back of the screen darker , which helps hide any bags or other storage stuff tucked in back of the screen .

http://driveredinabox.com/blog/driving-tips-how-to-keep-your-vehicle-centered-in-the-lane/<q>it 's real important to be able to keep your vehicle in the center of the lane . that 's why it 's one of the first things a new student learns in the parking lot , after they learn the basics of how to start and stop the vehicle .<q>just in case you and/or your student are having a bit of trouble with keeping the vehicle in the center of the lane , here some quick tips to get you back on track ( pun ! ) .<q>first , you need to remember is that it 's not you that needs to be in the center of the lane , it 's your vehicle . the driver 's seat is on the left side , not in the middle . if you try and center yourself in the lane , the vehicle 's going to be way over on the right !<q>also , one of the most common things that may cause you to drift away from the center of your lane is if you 're looking down over the hood of the vehicle , focusing on things that are too close . you want to make sure you 're looking as far up the center of your intended path as you can , which generally means you 're looking at the horizon . what 's right in front of your vehicle ( that you can see ) is available to your peripheral vision . and your peripheral vision can alert you to a problem . keep your focus far ahead , and you 'll still see what 's in front of your vehicle .<q>one last pointer , to help you keep the center of the vehicle in the lane , it helps to know where the center of your vehicle is . the vehicle 's forward pivot point is at the center of the wheelbase and that 's the point that tracks over your intended path .<q>know where that forward pivot point is , keep your eyes up at the horizon , and see that forward pivot point tracking over the center of your intended path that extends through the horizon . these pointers will keep you in the center of your lane and on track .<q>watch this video to see patrick barrett , the driver education guru , explain more about how to stay in the center of the lane .

in this tour through merida , mexico in the yucatan peninsula we will discover the best this city has to offer , in particular , the merida cathedral & paseo de montejo . those two landmarks of merida are two of the reasons why this city is considered the cultural and intellectual hub of the peninsula .<q>click here for our merida food tour : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22npuadwu9e&t=7s<q>this merida street food tour allowed us to try sample of fruits , juices , walk along to tasting spots where you can try native dishes such as ` cochinita pibil ' ( slow-roasted pork ) , ` panuchos ' ( tortillas stuffed with refried black beans ) , empanadas , and seafood tacos . end your tour with a sweet stop at a gelato shop specializing in local flavors .<q>more mexico : https://goo.gl/bzn0j8<q>------------------<q>subscribe ! - http://bit.ly/1m4etco<q>------------------<q>merida cathedral ( catedral de merida )<q>constructed from the stones of the mayan temples , this cathedral is the oldest on the mainland of the americas ( there is a cathedral in the dominican republic that is a couple of years older ) . the cathedral is huge , elegant with soaring stone ceilings . for a couple of pesos , you can get a guide to show you the features , or you can wander around on your own . a must see when visiting merida .<q>merida cathedral , known locally as catedral de san ildefonso , in mexico is a sixteenth century cathedral built by spanish colonialists .<q>in fact , constructed from 1556 to 1598 , merida cathedral was the first such cathedral to be built in the inland americas .<q>not only was merida cathedral built on the site of the former maya city of tiho , it was also constructed from the stones of maya pyramids .<q>paseo de montejo<q>following the henequen boom that thrived in the region in the late nineteenth century , a group of ruling yucatecans decided to launch a project to build a public promenade that " was worthy of merida " , and modernize the capital of the late nineteenth century . today this is called paseo de montejo and was built between 1886 and 1905 . it was inspired by the champs elysees in paris and named after the founder of the city of mérida , francisco de montejo and leon , " el mozo " . in this beautiful avenue you can find some of the most famous landmarks of the city such as the twin houses or casa camara , the imposing canton palace , the peon del minarete house , the peon de regil house , the quinta montes molina , the monuments to justo sierra and felipe carrillo puerto , and the famous homeland monument ( monumento a la patria ) which is one of the most important symbols of the city , conducted by the colombian master rómulo rozo .<q>merida :<q>mérida , mexico is the largest city in the yucatan but it does n't carry a big-city vibe at all . it 's a delightful town and there are so many fun things to do in merida . the city gives off almost more of a european feel yet is still very much mexico . here , colorful pastels blend with historic charm along merida 's grid-like streets . you 'll always be only a few blocks away from a plaza ( city square ) where there is likely some event going on .<q>the locals in mérida are very friendly , the food is delicious , and the nightlife is often jamming . if planning a trip to mérida , we would recommend trying to stay during the weekend , as the entire city tends to come out to play then .<q>yucatan :<q>mexico 's yucatan peninsula is one of the most popular tourism destinations .<q>major attractions include cancun , the islands of cozumel and isla mujeres , coral reefs , white-sand beaches , emerald-green waters , and perfect weather ; all of them strong magnets for international travelers .<q>the peninsula is also home to a large grouping of mayan archeological sites ; major ones include chichen itza , coba , edzna , kabah , tulum and uxmal .<q>many areas of the peninsula are blanketed by a thick jungle , and in the southeast , tropical rain forests merge into the borders with belize and guatemala .<q>---------------<q>• instagram - https://www.instagram.com/delightfultravellers/<q>• twitter - http://www.twitter.com/deltravellers<q>• facebook - https://www.facebook.com/delightfultravellers/?fref=ts<q>• snapchat : deltravellers<q>• website www.delightfultravellers.com<q>music<q>https://soundcloud.com/dandrum/taste-like

irshad ullah khan is a symbol of hope for the people of pakistan -- young , middle-aged and older . he was a successful businessman in singapore at top peaks . in 989 , he returned to pakistan with a few unique business ideas to support the country 's bankrupt economy and serve the poor . he pioneered the deep sea fishing earning a name for pakistan . the country whose sea products have now been banned in europe and other parts of the world was importing tuna fish to japan at that time . gem stone business and a luxurious housing society were other two enterprises that he launched in pakistan . but he did not know that a nightmare is waiting for him -- the corrupt , immoral and greedy politicians and bureaucrats made his life miserable . they hijacked his business . he fought a legal battle against them for 20 years facing tremendous harassment , threats to life and a heart ailment . all he had was faith in allah , strong willpower , hope , love for humanity and poetry . he was offered a british passport during this period . but he loved his country and wanted to serve the people . he never complained . he always looked happy , resolute and relaxed . people like him are rare in our society . any person with average nerves would have succumbed to the threats , coercion and pressures that the evil system had subjected him to . nothing could shake him . he crossed every hurdle courageously and now he is back to the path of prosperity . he is a slice of history . his story has a great lesson i.e. how one could live with dignity , honor and pride in difficult times . he narrates it in this interview to mohammad shehzad , editor , politics & development magazine , www.pol-dev.com . please visit the link below to read the full interview :<q>http://www.pol-dev.com/?p=560

2000 kawasaki super sherpa<q>the cool thing about most dirt bikes is that even though they get beat up on the regular , general maintenance and upkeep is typically pretty easy . most jobs can be done by even the most average of garage mechanics . for example , in this video , we 'll walk you through a simple valve inspection on a 2000 kawasaki super sherpa , a mule of a bike that has gained a cult following for its light weight , durability and ease of use . while we 're at it , we 'll replace the bike 's worn-out valve cover gasket , too .<q>as with most any maintenance work that requires access to the engine , the first thing we 'll do is remove the bike 's side covers and seat . next up , the fuel tank is removed to provide clean access to the valve cover and gasket . on most dirt bikes , all of these steps can be done via the removal of less than a handful of bolts . easy enough .<q>now that we 're ready to dive into to valve cover , start with removing the plug cable and the valve cover bolt caps . at this point , the valve cover should be easily removed by backing out the cover bolts . we can now begin the valve inspection .<q>in order to get an accurate read on valve clearances , we 'll need to verify the engine is at top dead center . to do this , remove the timing inspection and rotor bolt plugs . using these ports , rotate the motor to align the top dead center marks . once at tdc , use a set of good feeler gauges ( http://goo.gl/e1dy2 ) and verify clearances . for the super sherpa , exhaust clearances should be between .14 mm and .23 mm . intake valves should be between .10 mm and .19 mm . our bikes valves checked out ok and we 're well within spec . just what we like to see .<q>after giving the valve cover a good scrub down , we 're ready to install the new valve cover gasket . apply a thin layer of silicone to the contact surface for the gasket on the engine casing . this will help ensure a good seal once everything is reinstalled . the final steps are remounting the valve cover and gasket , tightening to spec and reinstalling the tank and body panels .<q>there ya go . while the super sherpa is admittedly even easier to work on than most dirt bikes , the principle remains the same . with some decent tools and basic mechanical aptitude , simple maintenance of your dirt bike can be done right at home .

click on the link below for a free video guide to dietary supplements and herbal medicine !<q>http://utahtexans.com/<q>in this video i want to share some treatments for a whooping cough that could help .<q>so what is a whooping cough . all around you is something called germs . right now there are more germs on your body than people living in the united states . germs are things that are bad and you ca n't see them such as viruses , bacteria , fungus 's and protozoa .<q>if a person breaths in the bacteria it will attach itself to the respiratory system and grow . the immune system responds with swelling and inflammation creating the cough .<q>other signs would be nausea , wanting to vomit , a runny nose , perhaps a fever . if you are wondering if it 's contagious then the answer is yes it is . people get it from breathing and its most dangerous in children .<q>a whooping cough sucks , it 's embarrassing so what do we do about it ? well , the first instinct is do buy some cough medicine so you can go out in public without infecting everyone . dr. weil feels that this can lessen the frequency of the cough and intensity but it can make it linger for a longer period of time .<q>if diagnosed in the first week antibiotics could lessen the severity or duration of the infection . antibiotics carry their own problems such as killing helpful bacteria in your digestive system , which many people do n't know , and abusing them leading the enemy to become resistant to them .<q>instead of antibiotics believe it or not there are natural antibiotics . herbal remedies that kill harmful bacteria that is causing the cough . that is the real goal right ? not just mask the symptoms .<q>one idea is garlic , which you can take a supplement or eat raw . you breath will stink with eating it or chopping it up in a drink , but that is the least of your problems .<q>a study at washington university shows that garlic is 100 times more effective than two top antibiotics in fighting campylobacter , the bacteria responsible for much of the world 's intestinal illnesses .<q>another herb is turmeric it 's the same as curcumin . turmeric is the yellow powder and curcumin is the ingredient in it . again you can sprinkle the powder in a drink or take a supplement .<q>according the u.s. national library of medicine animal experiments have demonstrated that curcumin applied at high doses has strong antibacterial activity .<q>lastly eat honey . if you have a kid with a whooping cough these 3 ingredients you can make in a drink and try to get the kid to drink it .<q>in a study at oxford journal they tested honey on antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria . at 40 % vol honey completely killed the bacteria at 20 % had potent bactericidal activity .<q>there really are tons more herbs that can really help . the cool thing is they have supplements that combine a crap load of these herbs that boost your immune system . if you click on the link below i talk about them and compare these types of products . to learn more simply click on the link below .<q>http://utahtexans.com/
