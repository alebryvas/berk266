[CLS] hey , everyone , welcome to garden fork . [SEP] [CLS] today , should you use pressure treated lumber in your garden , specifically raised vegetable beds . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m go ##n na answer that today in garden fork , all right ? [SEP] [CLS] first , we got ta throw the ball . [SEP] [CLS] as far as we can . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ve built raised beds with pressure treated lumber , and without . [SEP] [CLS] the regular southern pine ones , i coated with lin ##see ##d oil , and t lasted about 10 years . [SEP] [CLS] you can see here , of what the inside of the bed looked like as i took that one apart . [SEP] [CLS] but there is a new kind of pressure treated lumber out there , that is copper infused , rather than arsenic infused . [SEP] [CLS] and reading online , with some people that actually know what t ' ##re talking about , i think it ' ##s actually okay to use this new copper infused , pressure treated lumber in your vegetable beds . [SEP] [CLS] a 2007 study of the safety of ac ##q published in human and ecological risk assessment concluded that exposure to copper from contact with ac ##q treated wood is not expected to have adverse effects on the health of adults or children . [SEP] [CLS] this is the new copper infused kind , it ' ##ll have a label on the side here telling you about it . [SEP] [CLS] i do n ##' ##t think there ' ##s any of the older , arsenic based stuff for sale anymore , to tell you the truth . [SEP] [CLS] first i wan na say that i am not a scientist . [SEP] [CLS] , i ' ##m just your average gardener guy . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] you look like a scientist . [SEP] [CLS] i am not a scientist . [SEP] [CLS] ( chuckles ) ( woman laughs ) but i am a real ##ist , all right ? [SEP] [CLS] so here ' ##s a couple of points that i , doing some research , found out . [SEP] [CLS] the copper in the new copper infused treated woods , deter ##s insects . [SEP] [CLS] and copper is actually used as a fungi ##cide in vegetable gardening . [SEP] [CLS] is that the right word ? [SEP] [CLS] anyway , we use now copper as a fungi ##cide for vegetable gardening . [SEP] [CLS] so copper in the wood , i think is okay . [SEP] [CLS] and if a plant absorb ##s too much copper , it ' ##ll die . [SEP] [CLS] so you ' ##re not go ##n na eat it anyway , because it ' ##s dead . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] it ' ##ll regulate it for you . [SEP] [CLS] the fungi ##cide

[CLS] hey , it ' ##s me , how you doing , welcome to garden fork . [SEP] [CLS] today i ' ##m working on my new maple syrup eva ##por ##ator and i wanted to show you a tool . [SEP] [CLS] i have that if you ' ##re thinking about you ' ##d like to do some welding from time to time , you do n ##' ##t need to spend a huge amount of money buying gas and a mig we ##lder and stuff like that . [SEP] [CLS] you can also get an inexpensive flux core we ##lder . [SEP] [CLS] and before everyone piles on me , this is just for occasional stuff . [SEP] [CLS] you wan na fix your mo ##wer deck or something like that . [SEP] [CLS] just wan na show you what i do . [SEP] [CLS] and maybe you guys might wan na try it as well . [SEP] [CLS] alright , let ' ##s go . [SEP] [CLS] , i am an amateur we ##lder . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ve taken a welding class . [SEP] [CLS] , i learned a lot , but i am , by all means , an amateur . [SEP] [CLS] this is more me trying to get you guys interested in maybe trying welding for yourself , if you ' ##ve never done it , or if you just wan na have a we ##lder rig that from time to time you wan na fix something . [SEP] [CLS] i think this will make you happy . [SEP] [CLS] this is my favorite part , the hood . [SEP] [CLS] this is a 90 amp flux core we ##lder that i got from harbor freight . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s about $ 100 , you might be able to catch it on sale . [SEP] [CLS] what flux core means is that there is flux inside the metal welding wire that comes out of the tip here . [SEP] [CLS] that also means that this thing puts off a lot of smoke , so do this in a well vent ##ila ##ted area . [SEP] [CLS] i usually do it outside or in my garage here . [SEP] [CLS] do n ##' ##t do this inside in a basement shop , okay . [SEP] [CLS] but the beauty of this is it ' ##s inexpensive , it ' ##ll we ##ld thin metals , and with a little practice , you can get really good at this . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m just kind of a rank amateur , but this will really with my eva ##por ##ator . [SEP] [CLS] so i wanted to show you just this welding that i ' ##m go ##n na do . [SEP] [CLS] and we ' ##ll go from there , alright . [SEP] [CLS] this is some of the gear . [SEP] [CLS] i have safety glasses on , underneath
[CLS] we ' ##re here in a hallway . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s actually the top of my house , my hallway . [SEP] [CLS] i wan na show you how i get up into the top of this hallway to do painting or repairs . [SEP] [CLS] so , first off , i use one of these adjustable extension ladder ##s . [SEP] [CLS] t come in various brand names , but you can move these up and down . [SEP] [CLS] , t ' ##re adjustable , t bend all sorts of ways . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re go ##n na just use it as a straight extension ladder . [SEP] [CLS] you could also just use an extension ladder as well . [SEP] [CLS] so if we wan na get up into the top of the hallway you would think oh i ' ##ll just put the ladder . [SEP] [CLS] , i do n ##' ##t wan na poke a hole in the ceiling , like this right ? [SEP] [CLS] here ##s the problem with that . [SEP] [CLS] the problem is this , if you put down the ladder on the stairs cross ##ways one leg sits on the stair , this other leg has nothing to hold onto . [SEP] [CLS] so i ' ##ve got a solution for that . [SEP] [CLS] first measure across how far out this leg sticks out into the air here , and then add an inch or two . [SEP] [CLS] and then measure how far down it is to the step from that leg as well and write down those two numbers . [SEP] [CLS] so take that width measurement and cut it out of a nice piece of wood . [SEP] [CLS] i used common pine here . [SEP] [CLS] so this is the width again , from the one step of the ladder to the other step of the ladder here . [SEP] [CLS] then that rise or that height measurement , right here . [SEP] [CLS] i cut another piece of wood . [SEP] [CLS] so we have our rise and our width , and i secured it with a two by three here . [SEP] [CLS] out of some scrap pl ##ywood , i made some triangles . [SEP] [CLS] ( sound of drill ) to give some added strength ( sound of drill ) to our step . [SEP] [CLS] ( sound of drill ) so then figure out where you want to place your ladder and place your step right there . [SEP] [CLS] by the way the usual safety rules apply be very careful with ladder ##s , always have somebody helping you . [SEP] [CLS] this is a use this information at your own risk . [SEP] [CLS] place your ladder , find your step , make sure its secure . [SEP] [CLS] ( music ) ( climbing the ladder ) now i can get

[CLS] everyone this is our mate i was all set bee ##keeping . [SEP] [CLS] this is our maple syrup update . [SEP] [CLS] this is our second year making maple syrup . [SEP] [CLS] i just want to show you this new system . [SEP] [CLS] i have i ' ##m still using prop ##ane . [SEP] [CLS] but i ' ##ve got kind of a two stage system here . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ve got a deep fry ##er turkey deep fry ##er with a big pot on it . [SEP] [CLS] and this one takes the cold sap and brings it up to a boiling temperature you pour cold snap in here . [SEP] [CLS] and you bring it up . [SEP] [CLS] and then i slowly lad ##le this after it ' ##s boiling . [SEP] [CLS] i label it into this bigger one this is a kind of a higher power prop ##ane burn ##er . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s a 54 , 000 bt ##u . [SEP] [CLS] this is a big metal salad ball i bought for 10 bucks at the dollar store and this is our finishing . [SEP] [CLS] you can say you really ca n ##' ##t see it . [SEP] [CLS] but it ' ##s starting to turn a maple color here . [SEP] [CLS] so i heat up everything in the first one . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s kind of like a primary boil . [SEP] [CLS] and then i scoop it into this one here . [SEP] [CLS] so this is where i finish it off you can also if you want to get it very close to your proper boiling point which is seven and a half degrees above your boiling point around here . [SEP] [CLS] you can also finish it on your stove top a lot of times . [SEP] [CLS] i just finish it here . [SEP] [CLS] well it ' ##s kind of carbon intensive . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re using prop ##ane you get a little expensive a lot of prop ##ane we ' ##re going through . [SEP] [CLS] but this is what we do on our second year . [SEP] [CLS] here we are just a quick update on our sat boiling this . [SEP] [CLS] is a big kind of metal salad bowl i got at the dollar store . [SEP] [CLS] and as you see the way it ' ##s foam ##ing here . [SEP] [CLS] this means that it ' ##s very close to being syrup . [SEP] [CLS] and we want it to be seven and a half degrees above boiling boiling here . [SEP] [CLS] is 210 degrees and we ' ##re at 212 213 . [SEP] [CLS] you see the way it ' ##s foam ##ing up this . [SEP] [CLS] is a clear sign that you are near sap . [SEP] [CLS] i want two hundred seventeen and
[CLS] today , i wanted to show you an inexpensive way to change clear glass to frost ##ed glass . [SEP] [CLS] these are some french doors between two bedrooms . [SEP] [CLS] and instead of buying frost ##ed glass to put in here , for privacy between the two rooms , you can frost it with this frost ##ed glass material . [SEP] [CLS] that you basically lay on the existing glass . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s pretty simple , my sister and i have been doing it , so i wanted to show you how to do it . [SEP] [CLS] [ man ] so first you pre ##cut the frost ##ed material to the size of the window . [SEP] [CLS] this has a cardboard backing on it , and that pulls forward like that , right ? [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] right , and there ' ##s no glue . [SEP] [CLS] , it ' ##s not sticky . [SEP] [CLS] right , so then you have a spray bottle , this is just an old glass cleaner bottle we had . [SEP] [CLS] spray some water on there . [SEP] [CLS] and then , we have the texture ##d side facing out . [SEP] [CLS] and we tuck this up in there . [SEP] [CLS] you can pull it back up and lay it back down . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s not like an instant glue or anything . [SEP] [CLS] you can res ##pr ##ay it with water if you want . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] it ' ##s very for ##giving , thank goodness . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] i ' ##ve been doing the cutting . [SEP] [CLS] ( calm music ) and i think old glass pan ##es are imp ##re ##cise , right ? [SEP] [CLS] yeah , these are old . [SEP] [CLS] this is really old , and it ' ##s got a lot of junk on it . [SEP] [CLS] make sure the window is clean first . [SEP] [CLS] and then we take some sort of sq ##ue ##ege ##e . [SEP] [CLS] this is an old pastry sq ##ue ##ege ##e , we have . [SEP] [CLS] and we go across , like that . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] you ' ##re squeezing out the water ? [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re doing this , and i just wanted to share with you all . [SEP] [CLS] so , if you have a big window in a bathroom , and you ' ##re like . [SEP] [CLS] you know , you can still have the beautiful light . [SEP] [CLS] but you ' ##re go ##n na frost it , and you have the sunlight , but it ' ##s diffuse ##d . [SEP] [CLS] so people do n ##' ##t need to see your fine ph ##ys ##ique through the window .

[CLS] this is a very cool animated illusion i ' ##m going to show you how to make your own at home now at first . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s a little difficult but once you get the hang of it . [SEP] [CLS] it becomes a lot easier . [SEP] [CLS] and then you ' ##ll be able to come up with your own designs . [SEP] [CLS] so in order to make the animation that we just saw you ' ##ll start with one ball and then copy it five more times for a total of six ball now that ' ##s very important to remember all these animation ##s will consist of six frames and you will use that number throughout this process so we have the six balls in any order that you want you can have them straight across or bouncing . [SEP] [CLS] i just did mine in a straight line to keep it easy the next step will be to create this pattern . [SEP] [CLS] now remember the number six because that will come into play in this design right here you have the black bars . [SEP] [CLS] and you have the white space in between one of these black bars . [SEP] [CLS] equals six of these white spaces so if you were to take one of these white spaces and lay it out six times it would equal the width of one of these black bars . [SEP] [CLS] so once you make this you make it all the way across as long as you want as tall as you want . [SEP] [CLS] but i have enough space to move . [SEP] [CLS] and just make sure and keep that in mind you have to be very accurate or the other work now once you have this pattern . [SEP] [CLS] and you have your objects laid out like this . [SEP] [CLS] and you lay it over your objects in whatever program you ' ##re using like photos ##hop . [SEP] [CLS] so this would be on one layer this would be on another layer and basically you want to crop out each ball with this pattern and . [SEP] [CLS] when you move to the next ball you move this pattern over six spaces again . [SEP] [CLS] so let ' ##s say we lay this pattern over the first ball . [SEP] [CLS] crop out this image on this ball so while you ' ##re left with is what looks like this on the first ball . [SEP] [CLS] then you move this image over six spaces to the right one two three four five six crop the second moment then you move this image over six more spaces one two three four five six crop the third ball and you keep moving six spaces and crop ##ping each object until you get to the end in which you ' ##re left with a

[SEP] [CLS] but i know on this truck that it means that the front wheel bearings are going bad pay no attention to the dogs and frank . [SEP] [CLS] who ' ##s that so this is something you can do you need to have some tools you need to set aside an afternoon to do this you need a track you need a truck or car this is for a rear wheel drive vehicle if you have a front wheel drive vehicle you can apply these same how to ' ##s to replacing the rear wheel bearings because the front wheel drive car does n ##' ##t have an axe on the back . [SEP] [CLS] so you can do that . [SEP] [CLS] i know what i ' ##m talking about alright start off with let ' ##s go first . [SEP] [CLS] you have to get your car off the ground you have to take the one in the front tire . [SEP] [CLS] so if you take it off one at a time and i use a regular floor jack for that you can also use a bottle jack . [SEP] [CLS] this is a bottle jack . [SEP] [CLS] t ' ##re a little more inexpensive that a lot more portable than a floor jack floor jack ##s are kind of big . [SEP] [CLS] you just keep that in your car all the time . [SEP] [CLS] the first thing that you do is you loosen the lu ##g nuts on your tire . [SEP] [CLS] and then you jack the car up . [SEP] [CLS] but then when you want to go work on your car . [SEP] [CLS] you lower the jack and put the car on a jack stand . [SEP] [CLS] the jack stand is under here . [SEP] [CLS] so you do n ##' ##t get crushed . [SEP] [CLS] this is your jack stand . [SEP] [CLS] you see it ' ##s right underneath the wheel i ' ##m going to be working on . [SEP] [CLS] and that ' ##s holding up the weight of the car . [SEP] [CLS] cu ##z i can lower my jack here . [SEP] [CLS] let ' ##s see that jack stand is holding up the car because hydraulic jack ##s every once in a while will let go . [SEP] [CLS] and you do n ##' ##t want to be underneath your car truck when that
[CLS] but now the challenge here is to stain these doors . [SEP] [CLS] and it ' ##s a little complicated by the fact that these are pine doors , and this is oak trim . [SEP] [CLS] and we went with the pine doors , really for budget reasons . [SEP] [CLS] oak doors are wicked expensive . [SEP] [CLS] but now we wan na stain them , and i wan na show you guys how i do wood stain ##ing . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m pretty much novice wood stain ##er , but again it was an opportunity to show you guys how to do something , and the best way to do that is by doing it . [SEP] [CLS] you do n ##' ##t wan na stain these in place , because people are living here . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re go ##n na take these into the shop , and stain them there . [SEP] [CLS] alright , here we go . [SEP] [CLS] ( upbeat music ) stain ##ing wood is not hard , but what ' ##s key is the prep . [SEP] [CLS] and i ' ##m not one for details , and this is very detail oriented , but i ' ##m go ##n na make it happen , and i ' ##m go ##n na show you guys how you can do it too . [SEP] [CLS] couple of key things you need . [SEP] [CLS] first of all , the stain ingredients , i call them . [SEP] [CLS] if you ' ##re go ##n na be using pine , or a soft wood , you need a pre stain condition ##er . [SEP] [CLS] i skipped this the first time i did it , and i paid the price . [SEP] [CLS] the stain is really b ##lot ##chy , on pine and soft woods , if you do n ##' ##t use this first . [SEP] [CLS] you want the stain itself . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##ll go into this more as we ' ##re applying it . [SEP] [CLS] and then , a poly ##ure ##than ##e . [SEP] [CLS] this will go on a couple days later , after the stain is dried . [SEP] [CLS] to prepare this , we ' ##re going to use a 220 grit sand ##paper . [SEP] [CLS] this is this new sand ##paper i just got at the store . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s like sand ##paper on a flexible film . [SEP] [CLS] be really good for getting around the corners and stuff here . [SEP] [CLS] some gloves , always good . [SEP] [CLS] some blue tape is handy to have . [SEP] [CLS] these are called tack cloth ##s . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s cheese ##cloth ##s that is imp ##re ##gna ##ted with . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s for pulling up the saw ##dust from the sand ##paper

[SEP] [CLS] this is a normal deck of red card except for the very bottom card which is blue in this case is five of diamonds you go through the regular red pack and find the other five diamonds . [SEP] [CLS] so you have two five of diamonds put your red . [SEP] [CLS] buy the diamonds on the bottom . [SEP] [CLS] and then you take the blue bottle diamond to put it on the very bottom next . [SEP] [CLS] you spread the card down . [SEP] [CLS] try out to show the red bottom card which is blue and have them pick a card okay to pick this one there cases . [SEP] [CLS] take that next thing we ' ##ll do is call hindi couple . [SEP] [CLS] it looks like you ' ##re making the cards up .

[CLS] everyone welcome to garden fork . [SEP] [CLS] today we ' ##re go ##n na put in an outdoor motion sensor light on our garage . [SEP] [CLS] and we picked the cold ##est day of the weekend to do it what are we go ##n na train a motion sense . [SEP] [CLS] well you know when you pull up in your car . [SEP] [CLS] and it ' ##s just kind of dark . [SEP] [CLS] so when we pull the truck up that the lights turn on and we can see where we ' ##re walking and everything . [SEP] [CLS] well snow the idea the motion sensors light turns off after like . [SEP] [CLS] five or ten minutes bring the ball here bring it here . [SEP] [CLS] annie bring it come on . [SEP] [CLS] so i am not a licensed electric ##ian . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m a home ##own ##er if you have doubts about whether you can do . [SEP] [CLS] this do n ##' ##t do it hire electric ##ian check with your local building codes . [SEP] [CLS] so what you ' ##re allowed to do in your house all right and let ' ##s go . [SEP] [CLS] motion sensor fixture you can buy all sorts of different kinds at the store i like this kind . [SEP] [CLS] these have the inca ##nde ##scent bulbs the ones that have the halo ##gen bulbs t tend to burn out . [SEP] [CLS] kind of t ' ##re more difficult to replace the first thing you have to think about where you want to put it on your garage i ' ##m going to put these . [SEP] [CLS] so i do n ##' ##t have to climb a ladder to change the bulbs . [SEP] [CLS] so i ' ##m going to put it right up here . [SEP] [CLS] well it ' ##s a small . [SEP] [CLS] i do n ##' ##t know so . [SEP] [CLS] but the i think the best way to do this is to wire this whole unit while you ' ##re on the ground . [SEP] [CLS] and then you can climb up there and put the whole thing in what you ' ##re going to need is an outdoor electrical box you ' ##re going to need your motion sensor you ' ##re going to need some wire . [SEP] [CLS] this is 14 it should be an outdoor great if you can if you ca n ##' ##t is n ##' ##t first off start off is your outdoor outlet comes with a bunch of plug ##s to plug the side holes . [SEP] [CLS] i mean you can put your outlet coming out of whatever we ' ##re going to use the one . [SEP] [CLS] so i put silicon seal and screwed all these in alright . [SEP] [CLS] this is n ##' ##t
[CLS] ( smooth music ) he ' ##s busy . [SEP] [CLS] today , we ' ##re going to put in a bathroom fa ##uce ##t . [SEP] [CLS] the pup ##s are going to help . [SEP] [CLS] ours we ' ##re going to have to do a little bit of extra work on because it ' ##s very old . [SEP] [CLS] but i just want to show you if you want to replace the fa ##uce ##t , is it leaking or something . [SEP] [CLS] this is your kitchen or your bathroom , your utility room , or wherever you want to go . [SEP] [CLS] as long as you have a milk jug . [SEP] [CLS] this is a very inexpensive play toy for pup ##pies that t like . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s a milk jug . [SEP] [CLS] you just give it to them , and t go . [SEP] [CLS] do you know have your mr ##. mag ##oo glasses on ? [SEP] [CLS] yeah , i got my mr ##. mag ##oo glasses on because i need to see close up today . [SEP] [CLS] usually , underneath your sink , you already have these turn ##off valves like this . [SEP] [CLS] in our house , we do n ##' ##t have them . [SEP] [CLS] so we have to put these on first . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re going to have to de sold ##er this joint right here . [SEP] [CLS] then we ' ##re going to put on a fitting , and then i ' ##m going to put these on here . [SEP] [CLS] what ' ##s up with the tin foil ? [SEP] [CLS] that ' ##s not usually in our bathroom . [SEP] [CLS] no , but the tin foil is here to protect the paint . [SEP] [CLS] because we ' ##re going to be using a prop ##ane torch fairly close to the wall . [SEP] [CLS] you should have your fire ex ##ting ##uis ##her close by . [SEP] [CLS] if you do n ##' ##t feel comfortable doing this , perhaps you should have a professional do this , alright . [SEP] [CLS] this is not part of the official how to , this is just eric doing it . [SEP] [CLS] because prop ##ane near a wall can start a fire . [SEP] [CLS] should we hire a professional ? [SEP] [CLS] oh you are a professional ! [SEP] [CLS] i am a pro ; no i ' ##m not . [SEP] [CLS] ( laughing ) i ' ##m a master of the obvious . [SEP] [CLS] how ' ##s that going moose ? [SEP] [CLS] ( cr ##ink ##le ) what i forgot to mention is we need to remove these copper pipes that are going up into the fa ##uce ##t . [SEP] [CLS] you want to disco ##nne ##ct them before you try to
[CLS] super easy , free wood , big bin . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera operator ] o ##oo ##wee ! [SEP] [CLS] these guys are obsessed with the tennis ball . [SEP] [CLS] t love the cold weather . [SEP] [CLS] and i ' ##m go ##n na have to throw the ball the whole time we ' ##re building this thing . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera operator ] you must be exhausted . [SEP] [CLS] because t know when we whip out the camera . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s time to play ball . [SEP] [CLS] ( laughing ) ( leaves rustling ) all right , four pal ##lets . [SEP] [CLS] you can find them probably at a hardware store or big box store . [SEP] [CLS] just ask them , do you have any pal ##lets ? [SEP] [CLS] and t ' ##re go ##n na say , oh yeah out in the back . [SEP] [CLS] t might need the pal ##let for something . [SEP] [CLS] but , sometimes t ' ##re recycling , but if t ' ##re throwing them out , go get them , all right ? [SEP] [CLS] [ camera operator ] is that made out of a particular kind of wood ? [SEP] [CLS] uh , i do n ##' ##t know . [SEP] [CLS] a lot of times it looks like t ' ##re made out of oak or pop ##lar or whatever t have . [SEP] [CLS] save the nice ##st looking one for the front of the bin . [SEP] [CLS] this is the nice ##st looking one , so we are going to set this one aside . [SEP] [CLS] so what we ' ##re go ##n na do is we ' ##re go ##n na build a box out of pal ##lets . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s go ##n na be a tall box . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s go ##n na be a little off level because we ' ##re on a sl ##op here . [SEP] [CLS] but that ' ##s the way it is . [SEP] [CLS] so first , we ' ##re just go ##n na tie these together lightly . [SEP] [CLS] and we ' ##re just go ##n na put some screw ##s in through the pal ##lets here from the side pal ##let to the end back pal ##let . [SEP] [CLS] ( drilling ) just to hold it there so we can work on it . [SEP] [CLS] then we ' ##re go ##n na make a little stronger connection with some shelf brackets i found off the street . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera operator ] you ' ##re very economical . [SEP] [CLS] well , people throwing them out , and i was like , oh yeah let ' ##s use them . [SEP] [CLS] all right these are some brackets that i found on the street . [SEP] [CLS] somebody was throwing
[CLS] i want to show you a really cool simple rain ##water collection system that she has here you can adapt this to your house a shed a barn but simple is good . [SEP] [CLS] that ' ##s what garden fork likes . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s really simple maybe give you some ideas about how to collect rain ##water at your house but just stuff t had laying around here . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s a tin roof . [SEP] [CLS] it does n ##' ##t have to pretend you could be shed . [SEP] [CLS] but t have a gut ##ter running along the whole edge here and that collects a ton of water so instead of having just just kind of you know a lot of barns it just kind of runs off the edge t put a gut ##ter here . [SEP] [CLS] but there ' ##s no downs ##po ##ut you see . [SEP] [CLS] instead t have a little divert ##er which is another piece of recycled gut ##ter pipe that t got from the town dump pretty cool at the end of our gut ##ter run . [SEP] [CLS] we have this piece of brown gut ##ter pipe that runs across and connects to a tank . [SEP] [CLS] so this runs from the roof line in that gut ##ter over to here and goes into just a big tank t had laying around and because one tech might fill up with one storm here t have connected a second tank . [SEP] [CLS] and t ' ##re slowly filling the second tank . [SEP] [CLS] just have that open a little bit . [SEP] [CLS] so our primary tank has a gut ##ter pipe running into it . [SEP] [CLS] then we have a small valve that ' ##s just slowly filling up this tank here and . [SEP] [CLS] the beauty of this is this is all gravity fed . [SEP] [CLS] we have an outlet with a regular garden hose here . [SEP] [CLS] and this is all gravity fed for the farm of course that so your tanks are back there . [SEP] [CLS] gravity feed water comes out . [SEP] [CLS] i mean it ' ##s not gus ##hing out . [SEP] [CLS] but you could water your plants . [SEP] [CLS] you can water your cows whatever you want so alright . [SEP] [CLS] oh this is called drip irrigation method videos all sorts of cool stuff if you like what you ' ##re saying here . [SEP] [CLS] would you hit the sub ##scribe button . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s free to sub ##scribe . [SEP] [CLS] we put out new videos every week cooking gardening . [SEP] [CLS] i got a ton of stuff to edit and show you guys . [SEP] [CLS] just i do n ##' ##t know i ' ##d like to share alright . [SEP] [CLS] if
[CLS] today , how to run a sewing machine or how to repair your pants . [SEP] [CLS] believe it or not i actually know how to run a sewing machine thanks to my mom . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] ( laughs ) t would rather not se ##w . [SEP] [CLS] t would rather go for walks . [SEP] [CLS] t wan na go outside , it ' ##s pouring rain . [SEP] [CLS] but my mother in law gave us a really cool sewing machine . [SEP] [CLS] and i thought , well , i ' ##m go ##n na fix my pants because my pants have some huge holes in them . [SEP] [CLS] my point here is that sewing machines are expensive new but you might find one at a garage sale or a tag sale . [SEP] [CLS] this one is really super nice in that this thing , comes out . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] i bet all these things have names for them . [SEP] [CLS] so this arm makes it really easy to fix pants and sleeves . [SEP] [CLS] so the first thing you wan na do is you have to make a patch to go over the big hole in your pants . [SEP] [CLS] ( laughs ) and the way to do that is you have to have a sac ##ri ##fi ##cial pair of pants that are beyond repair and i wear black car ##hart ##ts , right . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] you think t noticed ? [SEP] [CLS] yeah , so , i took a ##. , i have my car ##hart ##ts that are no longer wear ##able . [SEP] [CLS] i cut a piece out and i made a rec ##tangle . [SEP] [CLS] and i hem ##med it here , folded over the cloth and then se ##wed it here . [SEP] [CLS] so this is our patch . [SEP] [CLS] and that will be the outside of the patch . [SEP] [CLS] all right you have your patch . [SEP] [CLS] this is where the patch is go ##n na be on the outside of your pants . [SEP] [CLS] and then you are using some little pins to hold this in place to do the sewing . [SEP] [CLS] now the trick here is you wan na attach your patch to your pants but not the back of the pants . [SEP] [CLS] okay , so i usually put my hand inside and push the cloth up . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] and not stick yourself . [SEP] [CLS] right , do n ##' ##t stick yourself . [SEP] [CLS] you want this as flat as possible . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] and that ' ##s pretty thick material . [SEP] [CLS] yu ##p , but there you go , you just wan na hold it in place . [SEP] [CLS] and then we ' ##re
[CLS] , i think that ' ##s what it ' ##s called . [SEP] [CLS] today i ' ##m going to show you how to hand split fire wood . [SEP] [CLS] we also have a video about using a hydraulic split ##ter to split fire wood , but there ' ##s also , if you just feel like getting some exercise outdoors you can split wood by hand . [SEP] [CLS] ( dogs panting ) this is a bunch of birch from a birch tree dropped last year . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ve cut it in to , what i call a fire place length . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s a width that fits in our fire place nicely . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] ( laughing ) and then i let it dry for a year . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s much easier to split , i think , after a year . [SEP] [CLS] this is how i split wood other people may do it differently but just wanted to show ya an outdoor activity . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s kinda cat ##hart ##ic to swing an ax . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] so when you say it ' ##s been drying for a year , what do you mean by that ? [SEP] [CLS] well we cut this down last fall . [SEP] [CLS] and then we stacked it in our wood shed here to dry . [SEP] [CLS] in other words , wood that is wet or green has a lot of sap in it . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s difficult to split and it wo n ##' ##t burn either in your fire place . [SEP] [CLS] you have to let it season . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s called season ##ing the wood as well . [SEP] [CLS] so you see here how this has cracks in it now [ woman ] yeah that ' ##s signs that it has been drying [ woman ] de ##hy ##dra ##ted there you go a couple of tricks here . [SEP] [CLS] i always split the wood upside down . [SEP] [CLS] you can generally get a feel for which way the tree was pointing . [SEP] [CLS] and were going to do . [SEP] [CLS] is turn it upside down to split it . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] hey how do you know ? [SEP] [CLS] i just have a feel for wood . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] ( laughing ) i ' ##m the wood talk ##er . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s easiest , i think , to split wood when the ground is frozen . [SEP] [CLS] because you ' ##re slamming wood in to the ground . [SEP] [CLS] i always put a big piece of wood down here . [SEP] [CLS] ( metal ringing ) when you ' ##re splitting wood you ' ##re going to be throwing an ax in

[SEP] [CLS] ( engine shut ##s down ) first thing you wan na do is heat this puppy up because we ' ##re go ##n na change the oil . [SEP] [CLS] so let it run for about ten minutes .

[SEP] [CLS] first thing we ' ##re go ##n na do is we ' ##re go ##n na drain out the oil , put in a new oil filter , and put in fresh oil . [SEP] [CLS] so we start with that by draining it . [SEP] [CLS] i had a little piece of pipe on here that makes it a lot easier to drain this oil . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ve got a plastic milk cart ##on . [SEP] [CLS] and a funnel to drain this out . [SEP] [CLS] this is go ##n na be hot , so , careful . [SEP] [CLS] maybe you should wear some gloves . [SEP] [CLS] clean off a little bit of that drip . [SEP] [CLS] i really like this little pipe i added on here . [SEP] [CLS] see how dirty that is ? [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s been running your engine .

[CLS] alright , so you just got your new flat panel tv . [SEP] [CLS] and you want to put it on your dry ##wall or sheet ##rock wall using one of these tv mounts . [SEP] [CLS] today i ' ##m going to show you how to do that , it ' ##s really easy , even i can do it . [SEP] [CLS] and if i can do it , you can do it . [SEP] [CLS] is you want to figure out where on the wall you want this to be . [SEP] [CLS] this really helps to have two or maybe three people help you . [SEP] [CLS] you want to figure out roughly where you want it and then using a pencil , a light pencil ideally , you ' ##re going to mark , and i dropped the pencil , hold on . [SEP] [CLS] like i said , this is better with a couple of people . [SEP] [CLS] so , you want to mark with your pencil the outside edges , on both sides . [SEP] [CLS] so , we know in this area here , ideally , we need to find a stud . [SEP] [CLS] and a stud is the two by four , wood two by four , or a metal stud that is behind the sheet ##rock that we can drive into . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m going to show you how to do it into a stud . [SEP] [CLS] and if you ca n ##' ##t find the stud , what to do . [SEP] [CLS] this is a pretty cool stud find ##er , you can buy a bunch of them at the store . [SEP] [CLS] ( knocking ) i think that there is one here . [SEP] [CLS] ( bee ##ping ) ah , there we go . [SEP] [CLS] you can also sometimes look along , if you have your eye and you shine a light back this way you can see where the wall kind of mounds out a little bit . [SEP] [CLS] where the joint compound went over the joint and that ' ##s where a stud is , as well . [SEP] [CLS] another way you can do it , is , since this is going to be covered by a big tv panel , is you can just drill holes until you hit the stud . [SEP] [CLS] ( drilling ) ( knocking ) what do you think , about right there ? [SEP] [CLS] ( drilling ) it feels like it . [SEP] [CLS] lets get a screw and see . [SEP] [CLS] dry ##wall screw , lets see . [SEP] [CLS] ( drilling ) yeah , that ' ##s a stud . [SEP] [CLS] if it ' ##s not a stud , it does this . [SEP] [CLS] ( drilling ) just spins . [SEP] [CLS] so we ' ##re lucky in that there
[CLS] hey everyone , today on garden fork , how to replace a screening on a window or door . [SEP] [CLS] i did n ##' ##t do this . [SEP] [CLS] ( relaxing guitar music ) ( barking ) usually in the summer , this becomes screen door , but somebody blew through it last year . [SEP] [CLS] who broke through the screen door ?

[SEP] [CLS] , you just fix it , like i do , ready ? [SEP] [CLS] here ' ##s what you ' ##re go ##n na need : some screening sp ##line , a sp ##line tool , a really sharp brand new blade utility knife and some screen material . [SEP] [CLS] ideally , you want a big flat works ##pace as big as whatever screen you ' ##re replacing . [SEP] [CLS] use your knife and dig out a piece of the existing sp ##line here . [SEP] [CLS] and you just pull this out . [SEP] [CLS] and take that to the store and match it to the sp ##line t have , there ' ##s a couple different . [SEP] [CLS] there we go , be better if it looks like that . [SEP] [CLS] there ' ##s a couple different diameter ##s of sp ##line , it ' ##s like rubber ##y string . [SEP] [CLS] well , it ' ##s rubber . [SEP] [CLS] ; rope like , maybe that ' ##s the right word here . [SEP] [CLS] anyway go to the store and get that , get your sp ##line tool and again sharp utility knife . [SEP] [CLS] and then start taking this out . [SEP] [CLS] that comes out and then this comes out very easily . [SEP] [CLS] un ##roll your screen , can be a little tricky . [SEP] [CLS] make sure you have enough . [SEP] [CLS] these are called bulldog cl ##amps , i mean use what you got . [SEP] [CLS] i make sure the screen is overlap ##ped the corner and then i take this . [SEP] [CLS] and i snap that on like that . [SEP] [CLS] so this is the opposite corner that we just clamped . [SEP] [CLS] so pull this tight like that and take another cl ##amp slip that on like that . [SEP] [CLS] so i got four corners now , with the little cl ##amps . [SEP] [CLS] now we ' ##re go ##n na use our sp ##line tool . [SEP] [CLS] now on the sp ##line tool there are two ends ; two wheels . [SEP] [CLS] one of them is rounded like this and the other one has a groove

[CLS] to connect some tile , i wanted to share with you this cool tile cutter that i borrowed from my neighbor . [SEP] [CLS] this is a little portable tile cutter . [SEP] [CLS] it has a water reservoir down here . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera person ] oh cool ! [SEP] [CLS] that keeps the saw blade cool . [SEP] [CLS] it has a little handle over here , so you can just carry it around . [SEP] [CLS] and if you ' ##re thinking you have to do a lot of tile work for a project . [SEP] [CLS] instead of rent ##ing a big tile saw with a big bash tray and all that , maybe one of your neighbors has this , or you can buy it or rent it . [SEP] [CLS] but i just want to show you this easy way . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s like cut ##tin ' butter . [SEP] [CLS] i ca n ##' ##t find the mark , hold on . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera person ] your measure mark ? [SEP] [CLS] i might have to measure again . [SEP] [CLS] oh , there it is . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera person ] you have your ear mu ##ffs on ? [SEP] [CLS] i have ear protection on . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s really cold out . [SEP] [CLS] but this works really nicely . [SEP] [CLS] just a simple fence here . [SEP] [CLS] oh , i bumped it . [SEP] [CLS] just lock your fence down . [SEP] [CLS] now when you turn this thing on , the saw blade ' ##s go ##n na whip water at you , okay ? [SEP] [CLS] ( cutting noises ) nice , really simple . [SEP] [CLS] so i just wanted to share with you . [SEP] [CLS] i avoid tile at all costs , but sometimes i have to cut tile . [SEP] [CLS] all right , more cool stuff . [SEP] [CLS] di ##y garden for it go to sub ##scribe , the sub ##scribe button . [SEP] [CLS] and set up for our email . [SEP] [CLS] i ca n ##' ##t hear because i have the ear protection on . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera person ] ca n ##' ##t speak either ! [SEP] [CLS] no , i ca n ##' ##t . [SEP] [CLS] all right get our email news letter .

[CLS] this you ' ##re go ##n na use somewhere else , right ? [SEP] [CLS] ( lively music ) today we ' ##re go ##n na replace a ra ##dia ##tor steam valve and the ra ##dia ##tor itself . [SEP] [CLS] first , i need coffee . [SEP] [CLS] ( lively music ) today , brian and i are go ##n na replace the steam valve . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re also go ##n na switch out the ra ##dia ##tors . [SEP] [CLS] we talked about this in a previous video , but this is a giant ra ##dia ##tor here , and i ' ##m go ##n na switch it out with this little ra ##dia ##tor that i got at the scrap yard . [SEP] [CLS] ' ##ca ##use this hallway area here is just really small , so my help ##er is complaining about the pipe wren ##ch size . [SEP] [CLS] [ brian ] it ' ##s a little big , okay . [SEP] [CLS] basically this is a video about how to replace steam valves , in case you ' ##re wondering , and also we ' ##re go ##n na switch out the ra ##dia ##tor . [SEP] [CLS] so step one , is you need a big pipe wren ##ch on the nut that connects the valve to the ra ##dia ##tor . [SEP] [CLS] you need a lot of leverage to make this work . [SEP] [CLS] ( metal cl ##unk ##ing ) that works very nicely . [SEP] [CLS] i like how i run the camera and you do the work for my videos . [SEP] [CLS] [ brian ] i wonder about this . [SEP] [CLS] ( metal squeak ##ing ) [ narrator ] all right , that ' ##s the easiest part of this job , is removing that . [SEP] [CLS] [ brian ] well , it ' ##s not always easy , though . [SEP] [CLS] [ narrator ] no , it ' ##s not . [SEP] [CLS] [ brian ] a 100 year old . [SEP] [CLS] [ narrator ] hand truck . [SEP] [CLS] [ brian ] yeah , t ' ##re very heavy . [SEP] [CLS] [ narrator ] this is the valve i want to take the valve off . [SEP] [CLS] so brian is going to do that , while i hold the camera . [SEP] [CLS] [ brian ] i ' ##m not sure if i can . [SEP] [CLS] [ narrator ] yes we can . [SEP] [CLS] [ narrator ] so we ' ##ve got the back pipe . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##ve got the supply pipe braced by that one pipe wren ##ch which is on the ground . [SEP] [CLS] we have another large pipe wren ##ch here . [SEP] [CLS] [ brian ] it ' ##s actually working . [SEP] [CLS] [ narrator ] yeah , that ' ##s a three
[CLS] i ' ##m go ##n na put some wooden blinds in these windows . [SEP] [CLS] and i thought i ' ##d make a video and show you guys how to do it . [SEP] [CLS] there ' ##s a couple things you need to pay attention to when ordering and installing blinds . [SEP] [CLS] , i ' ##ve learned from , let ' ##s just call it experience . [SEP] [CLS] but another di ##y project , if i can do it , you can do it . [SEP] [CLS] ready , here we go . [SEP] [CLS] most of the time , you ' ##re go ##n na be ordering blinds at a store and online , and you ' ##re go ##n na have to provide some measurements . [SEP] [CLS] learn from my mistakes here , okay . [SEP] [CLS] you wan na measure your window , the width of it , in at least three places . [SEP] [CLS] i suggest the bottom , the middle , and the top . [SEP] [CLS] the reason we ' ##re doing this is we want to find the narrow ##est width of the window opening , because you do n ##' ##t wan na install blinds that you just measure down here , and then maybe , the trim bows in half way up , so that , when you drop your blinds and kun ##ck , t get stuck . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s a bad thing . [SEP] [CLS] again , learn from me , someone that ' ##s done that . [SEP] [CLS] you can even just kind of move this all the way up , looking for the narrow ##est width , and that is the number that you provide to the blind ordering people . [SEP] [CLS] you also wan na measure from top to bottom . [SEP] [CLS] that ' ##s a little more straight forward . [SEP] [CLS] go to the top , measure all the way to the bottom . [SEP] [CLS] that number is pretty straight forward . [SEP] [CLS] all right , your blinds have been delivered . [SEP] [CLS] if you have more than one window . [SEP] [CLS] you ' ##re doing , you ' ##re probably wondering which blinds go where , because a lot of the windows are similar , but the dimensions might be slightly different . [SEP] [CLS] the blind company that i ordered these from puts a label right in here , with the dimensions that you gave for that window . [SEP] [CLS] if you wrote those all down somewhere , on a piece of paper , left window is this , right window is that , you can correspond to this . [SEP] [CLS] you ' ##re also going to get a bag of hardware . [SEP] [CLS] now , usually , you ' ##ll use all the hardware that ' ##s in here .
[CLS] he ' ##s a g ##la ##zier he does this for a living and . [SEP] [CLS] my windows are in really really bad shape . [SEP] [CLS] um so he was so nice to come here and show us how to do this because i ' ##ve tried this and i ' ##ve screwed it up so really badly . [SEP] [CLS] actually i bought this thing that ' ##s called a put ##ty chase ##r . [SEP] [CLS] and you put a drill out of any garden . [SEP] [CLS] and it destroyed the wood i guess maybe if you were careful you could do a good job . [SEP] [CLS] and i i did not few things that we need to start with you . [SEP] [CLS] need to get get yourself a put ##ty knife . [SEP] [CLS] i find the ones that are have a little bend like this work . [SEP] [CLS] um kind of just what i ' ##m i ' ##m used to using and also the thing about put ##ty nights and to get a really nice job . [SEP] [CLS] the the key is to have a stiff a stiff put ##ty knife . [SEP] [CLS] you do n ##' ##t want one that has a lot of flex or bend to it because you ' ##ve got to apply constant pressure to the put ##ty as your treasure running it to make the bea ##d nice and smooth and . [SEP] [CLS] another thing you need is either a gas ##ke ##t scrape ##r or a put ##ty knife with like a sharpened edge just something that you can not to lose put ##ty . [SEP] [CLS] oh this put ##ty is is really old and dried out and as you can see it ' ##s kind of chip ##ping off and fl ##aking so this is going to be really really easy to clean out just trying to get in there . [SEP] [CLS] that ' ##s a bad shape t want to go nice and easy because you do n ##' ##t want to break the glass that ' ##s in there . [SEP] [CLS] um then if you do break it it ' ##s not a big deal to replace it . [SEP] [CLS] but if you can avoid it you want to you want to avoid it . [SEP] [CLS] and when you ' ##re scraping this out you got to be careful because if you look there are points t actually block the glass up . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s a little piece of metal like right there a little triangles . [SEP] [CLS] and that ' ##s called a point . [SEP] [CLS] so again you just bus all the old buddy out and sometimes it goes little hardness . [SEP] [CLS] this is when you ' ##re doing a just a reg ##laze like this . [SEP] [CLS] the most

[CLS] there ' ##s a big crack that goes through the whole floor . [SEP] [CLS] and we ' ##ve been trying to figure out how to deal with . [SEP] [CLS] there ' ##s a number of methods . [SEP] [CLS] and i told her if she chip ##ped out the crack . [SEP] [CLS] i show her how to use hydraulic cement um to fix it . [SEP] [CLS] so here we are she has chip ##ped out the crack which is the really pain part of this thing . [SEP] [CLS] and uh you can see here . [SEP] [CLS] this is a very good job you want that all clean . [SEP] [CLS] if you see anything loose in here you should just pull it out like these little pieces here . [SEP] [CLS] and like there you know just got that just pull that out . [SEP] [CLS] it sounds like you ' ##re cleaning somebody ' ##s teeth . [SEP] [CLS] but the more loose material you get out the better this is called hydraulic cement now most cement ##s when you pour them out . [SEP] [CLS] t contract a little bit in hydraulic cement . [SEP] [CLS] very well you have to use it in small batch ##es . [SEP] [CLS] so we ' ##re going to show you how to do that okay by the way this is a wood chi ##sel you do n ##' ##t use that for concrete . [SEP] [CLS] this is a really good chi ##sel for cleaning out stuff because it has a protector . [SEP] [CLS] so when you ' ##re hitting with a hammer you do n ##' ##t hit your hand . [SEP] [CLS] if you miss you get the plastic instead of hitting your hand you know when you ' ##re going to be chi ##sel ##ing . [SEP] [CLS] use the safety glasses because concrete will chip up and hit you in the eye that ' ##s a bad thing get out the loose stuff we ' ##ve got wire brushes you can clean out the crack with that . [SEP] [CLS] you know just be creative you could use a screw ##drive ##r as well . [SEP] [CLS] but you know screw ##drive ##rs your screw ##drive ##r but safety . [SEP] [CLS] first you have to wear gloves when working with this stuff do not use cement without wearing gloves on . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m going to use these fancy blue gloves the ni ##tri ##le gloves t ' ##re called . [SEP] [CLS] but t work really well or . [SEP] [CLS] a heavy rubber glove do n ##' ##t use the late ##x ones . [SEP] [CLS] have i think t had lie in them and that hurts your hands . [SEP] [CLS] so if you like a doctor here . [SEP] [CLS] this one hurt a good sam here . [SEP] [CLS] you
[CLS] i could n ##' ##t pass it up . [SEP] [CLS] neighbor had this out in front of his house . [SEP] [CLS] and i said does it work ? [SEP] [CLS] and i did n ##' ##t wan na drag it all the way home if it did n ##' ##t work . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m like you sure it works ? [SEP] [CLS] he said that the people that had it in their apartment did n ##' ##t want it anymore , well it was in their backyard , not in their apartment , and that ' ##s like three , four hundred dollars . [SEP] [CLS] so it ' ##s like well . [SEP] [CLS] but it does n ##' ##t work . [SEP] [CLS] here ' ##s my issue here . [SEP] [CLS] you turn this on , press the button , and this flames up . [SEP] [CLS] and then the flame goes out in about 10 seconds . [SEP] [CLS] so there ' ##s clearly something wrong . [SEP] [CLS] and then it ' ##s not getting gas . [SEP] [CLS] so the regulator , it regulates the gas flow coming from the tank going into your grill and sometimes it needs to be reset or replaced . [SEP] [CLS] so i ' ##m go ##n na show you a little trick to try and rest the regulator . [SEP] [CLS] now if that does n ##' ##t work , then you can just go and buy replacement regulator at your lo ##cat hardware store , drop it in , and you ' ##re ready to go . [SEP] [CLS] alright , watch this little trick , see what happens . [SEP] [CLS] so i think the cu ##lp ##rit here is the regulator . [SEP] [CLS] that ' ##s the little gi ##z ##mo here . [SEP] [CLS] those things die out kind of just whenever t want . [SEP] [CLS] turn the tank valve off and disco ##nne ##ct the regulator from the tank like that . [SEP] [CLS] now open your hood , turn all your valves to high . [SEP] [CLS] now with the valves open and the tank disconnected .

[CLS] your formal introduction to framing look good today . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re go ##n na know all right today . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re go ##n na cut down a tree . [SEP] [CLS] and we ' ##re go ##n na use the chains ##aw to do it . [SEP] [CLS] maybe we should do the opening later . [SEP] [CLS] okay say to the camera . [SEP] [CLS] today we ' ##re going to chop down a tree using a chains ##aw but . [SEP] [CLS] first some safety precautions cool eric why are you wearing those jets . [SEP] [CLS] so i do n ##' ##t cut my leg off by accident or bleed all over bill ' ##s lawn here . [SEP] [CLS] so right when you ' ##re using a chains ##aw chains ##aw . [SEP] [CLS] is the most dangerous tool you can own without having to have a permit or a license to use this thing these things . [SEP] [CLS] will t wo n ##' ##t cut your leg all the way off . [SEP] [CLS] but t ' ##ll t ' ##ll cut in deep enough that you can bleed to death if there ' ##s been a lot of injuries with chains ##aw ##s people go to the store and t buy one . [SEP] [CLS] and t do n ##' ##t take the time to learn about it . [SEP] [CLS] and t do n ##' ##t wear the proper safety equipment . [SEP] [CLS] the most important thing i think you need to own is a pair of chains ##aw cha ##ps . [SEP] [CLS] so these are t ' ##re not always orange . [SEP] [CLS] but t ' ##re a tough nylon material . [SEP] [CLS] and then t have a ke ##v ##lar fiber in them . [SEP] [CLS] and what happens is if you ' ##re cutting and you accidentally get near your leg . [SEP] [CLS] the chain will cut into this . [SEP] [CLS] and then what looks like a just bunch of giant milk ##weed pod things bursts out and jam ##s the saw and keeps you from cutting your leg . [SEP] [CLS] so basically these things will cause the chains ##aw to stall . [SEP] [CLS] a while ago i was kneeling down like this . [SEP] [CLS] and i was cutting a limb and the saw dropped down and got near my knee . [SEP] [CLS] and i do n ##' ##t did n ##' ##t really know how close it was and . [SEP] [CLS] all of a sudden a bunch of this white puff ##y material comes out of the chains ##aw cha ##ps and jam ##s the saw and all the sudden . [SEP] [CLS] and i realize that i almost cut into my knee ##cap here with the chains ##aw . [SEP] [CLS] so even people like me who think t
[CLS] ( laughs ) are you ready to go ? [SEP] [CLS] do you wan na learn about the eva ##por ##ator ? [SEP] [CLS] [ announcer ] make , fix , grow , cook . [SEP] [CLS] ( instrumental music ) drop . [SEP] [CLS] so , i made kind of a quick ##ie video about this a while ago . [SEP] [CLS] but , i want to give you a detailed walk through of improvements i ' ##ve made and some improvements that you could make when you build this thing . [SEP] [CLS] and i always learn from you guys . [SEP] [CLS] so comments or questions below . [SEP] [CLS] let ' ##s take a look . [SEP] [CLS] so our first eva ##por ##ator was steam table pan ##s dropped in a file cabinet . [SEP] [CLS] a bunch of people made them and that was really kinda cool . [SEP] [CLS] and actually i decided to upgrade . [SEP] [CLS] so i gave my version one cabinet to my neighbor down the road who ' ##s very happy with that . [SEP] [CLS] but let ' ##s walk through some of the improvements i made . [SEP] [CLS] first of all i just left the pieces of metal between the drawers in here to support the new tray . [SEP] [CLS] and then i put in . [SEP] [CLS] , i kept the expanded steel gr ##ating here and you might want to consider using straight sheet metal here instead of the expanded steel . [SEP] [CLS] and i ' ##ll talk about that a little more later . [SEP] [CLS] the other thing i did was , when you were boiling with version 1 . [SEP] [CLS] 0 the steam tunnel trace . [SEP] [CLS] when this thing was whom ##ping , you could n ##' ##t get too close to the cabinet ' ##ca ##use it would melt your pants . [SEP] [CLS] ( laughs ) so i bought inexpensive fire ##brick . [SEP] [CLS] i got these at the blue store . [SEP] [CLS] t ' ##re thin , t look more like a patio brick . [SEP] [CLS] but t ' ##re used for align ##ing wood stove ##s and t were about three bucks a piece if i remember correctly . [SEP] [CLS] t were n ##' ##t really expensive and i put those in here just being held in by gravity . [SEP] [CLS] i did n ##' ##t wire them in or anything . [SEP] [CLS] but that helped a lot in reflecting the heat back in to the cabinets instead of out and melting my clothes . [SEP] [CLS] , you would be like [ female ] then you ' ##d have more sewing to do . [SEP] [CLS] ( laughs ) we have a video about sewing machines . [SEP] [CLS] the sewing machines is the original 3 d printer . [SEP] [CLS] ( laughs

[SEP] [CLS] ( relaxed jazz ##y music ) if you got some cement on the end of a brick , you can usually just break it off . [SEP] [CLS] wear some safety glasses , okay ? [SEP] [CLS] and then this will chip off . [SEP] [CLS] ( hammering ) ( scraping ) nice . [SEP] [CLS] ( relaxed jazz ##y music ) so i keep the fire burning in the middle of the oven .

[SEP] [CLS] ( laughing ) the cool thing is , what i ' ##ve done , is i ' ##ve attached a indoor outdoor wet dry va ##c that someone was throwing out , with a little adapt ##er i bought , at the home improvement store , connected to the back of the saw .

[SEP] [CLS] what i like about this ( chuckle ) is i can roll this into the corner , when i ' ##m not using it . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s kinda big , but it just makes it a lot easier . [SEP] [CLS] and you do n ##' ##t have a big table

[CLS] basically have a stick with two sides both sides contain six colors the colors are the same on both sides . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ll ask you to pick a number between one and six . [SEP] [CLS] now let ' ##s say that you that you picked three . [SEP] [CLS] so i ' ##ll start with the blue and . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ll count three one two three your magic color is going to be orange . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ll give the stick a couple more flip ##s rub the orange a little more and magical ##ly the stick turns orange . [SEP] [CLS] now we ' ##ve got one side with our six colors . [SEP] [CLS] and we ' ##ve got the other side that ' ##s on inch . [SEP] [CLS] if we rub the orange side a little bit then both sides turn orange if we tap it . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re back to six colors with the ones on one side six cl ##ove ##s in the other tap it again . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##ve got multi colors on both sides . [SEP] [CLS] this dick has six colors on one side and one color on the other side so to make it look like it ' ##s got six colors on both sides when you turn the stick you twist it at the same time . [SEP] [CLS] so you ' ##re actually just showing the same sign when you twist it to do it fast enough . [SEP] [CLS] it looks like you ' ##re showing both signs you want to force the audience to always pick orange .

[SEP] [CLS] oh if t pick the number three one two three so let ' ##s say t pick the number five will spell it out . [SEP] [CLS] fi ve your magic number your magic color is going to be orange . [SEP] [CLS] so we give the stick a couple of turns we rub the magic color . [SEP] [CLS] give it another flip and it turns orange .

[CLS] ( hammering metal ) are you tired of breaking apart your pal ##let ' ##s like this ? [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] i am . [SEP] [CLS] stay tuned for a new tool on garden fork . [SEP] [CLS] ( light piano music ) first i wan na give credit where credit is due . [SEP] [CLS] i did n ##' ##t in ##vent this . [SEP] [CLS] my design is a modification of two different designs that i found in ins ##truct ##able ##s from rib ##its ##ky and darren , so a big thank you for them for giving me the genesis of the idea . [SEP] [CLS] here ' ##s what i built . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m using angle iron and some black pipe here . [SEP] [CLS] so , to start out with , i have a piece of 3 4 inch , three foot pipe with a 3 4 inch right angle here and . [SEP] [CLS] my idea with the right angle was that this would be increased leverage when you ' ##re pry ##ing and then i took an angle bracket here . [SEP] [CLS] and i laid it about where i thought it should go . [SEP] [CLS] and i marked it here . [SEP] [CLS] and then i drill pressed . [SEP] [CLS] i drilled these two holes . [SEP] [CLS] ( light piano music ) ( drilling ) i ' ##m just go ##n na make sure that these are all truly 1 4 here . [SEP] [CLS] ( machinery sounds ) so to assemble this , i ' ##ve got two 1 4 inch , these are grade 5 bolts , which is a little higher quality bolts . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ve got some 1 4 inch ny ##lock nuts and some oversized 3 8 nuts to act as space ##rs , some regular wash ##ers and some smaller bolts here with lock wash ##ers . [SEP] [CLS] lock wash ##ers are the key here for everything . [SEP] [CLS] so our 1 4 inch bolts go through two of the pieces of angle bracket . [SEP] [CLS] [ eric ] and then i slide on two of the oversized 3 8 nuts here , one 3 8 nut here and three wash ##ers . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] so two on one side and one on the other ? [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] oh , okay . [SEP] [CLS] [ eric ] so you space here . [SEP] [CLS] and i put it on backwards . [SEP] [CLS] this should be pointing the back . [SEP] [CLS] ( metal scraping ) ( light piano music ) then we take a lock wash ##er and one of these ny ##lock nuts . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] t ' ##re the key , i remember . [SEP] [CLS] so we ' ##ve got these two brackets on each side and t

[CLS] hey everyone , welcome to garden fork . [SEP] [CLS] today i ' ##m go ##n na give you a tour of my homemade greenhouse behind us here . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##ve had this house . [SEP] [CLS] well the greenhouse was here when we moved in . [SEP] [CLS] but i just wanted to show you , if you got a bunch of windows laying around , you could make something like this . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] ( laughs ) i was preoccupied by that . [SEP] [CLS] ( dogs talking ) alright , let me give you a tour . [SEP] [CLS] these are these giant windows that were in the garage actually when we bought the house . [SEP] [CLS] you might find these at a junk ##yard or something or maybe someone ' ##s throwing them out . [SEP] [CLS] and then the roof is actually fairly new . [SEP] [CLS] it is a corrugated greenhouse plastic that we bought at one of the home improvement stores . [SEP] [CLS] so , that ' ##s the new thing . [SEP] [CLS] it did have this kind of old style [ woman ] green , it was green . [SEP] [CLS] it was like a faded green roof but . [SEP] [CLS] a couple of tree limbs went through it and some ice . [SEP] [CLS] and so we upgraded and got something that ' ##s a little more robust . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] oh , i think this is where you say , we have a video about that . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s a lot of snow . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] you barely put a dent in it . [SEP] [CLS] yeah , well that ' ##s all i can reach . [SEP] [CLS] but it ' ##ll take some of the weight off . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] you wan na tell them about the ( woman screaming loudly ) ( woman and man laughing ) wow . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] it worked ! [SEP] [CLS] ( woman laughing ) see it ' ##s very simple . [SEP] [CLS] there is a bit of a snow load on here . [SEP] [CLS] so i ' ##ve upgraded the bracing of our roof here . [SEP] [CLS] so where the greenhouse meets the clap ##board of the house , i put in a big piece of flashing at an angle . [SEP] [CLS] so water does n ##' ##t get between the greenhouse and the clap ##board and rot that wood . [SEP] [CLS] it hits the metal flashing and then goes onto the roof ##ing of the greenhouse there . [SEP] [CLS] so , however your house is clad , think about that if you ' ##re attach ##ing your greenhouse to the wall of the house . [SEP] [CLS] i tried to build a new door and it did n

[CLS] everyone welcome to garden for today . [SEP] [CLS] of course we ' ##re going to show you today how to make a window box a window box or . [SEP] [CLS] like i guess i call it a flower box sometimes but a box that you can build to put flowers outside one of your windows and usually flower boxes you buy them . [SEP] [CLS] and t ' ##re kind of pretty . [SEP] [CLS] and then t rot and fall apart the promise . [SEP] [CLS] is because you ' ##re putting dirt into wood . [SEP] [CLS] so i have this kind of . [SEP] [CLS] i do n ##' ##t know if i invented it akin with this idea . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ve had to make a flower box that wo n ##' ##t rot . [SEP] [CLS] so we ' ##re go ##n na take it downstairs . [SEP] [CLS] well i do n ##' ##t know i came up with this idea . [SEP] [CLS] that i ' ##m sure other people have cu ##z . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ve rarely have an original thought in my head but the trick to these is what she makes your box . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s a cr ##ammed full of plants as we ' ##ve heard in a garden show once to cr ##am them in like a city bus city vet crime . [SEP] [CLS] so you want kind of over ##flow ##ing amount of flowers in there that ' ##s . [SEP] [CLS] like it ' ##s rush hour . [SEP] [CLS] so let ' ##s go in the shop . [SEP] [CLS] me pup ##s in china do this here . [SEP] [CLS] is the secret to your wooden flower box . [SEP] [CLS] this is a plastic insert this is you can buy this at any garden supply store . [SEP] [CLS] get one of these and get yourself a 1 by 8 . [SEP] [CLS] this is a 1 by 8 by 6 . [SEP] [CLS] you can also use a rough cut wood which is what the ones we showed you outside are made of . [SEP] [CLS] and you ' ##re going to make basically a rec ##tangle box . [SEP] [CLS] a wood box that goes around this plastic box that ' ##s all we ' ##re go ##n na do . [SEP] [CLS] so we ' ##re go ##n na measure these dimensions . [SEP] [CLS] cut a piece of wood and screw it together and show you how to do this . [SEP] [CLS] so this is 24 by 8 . [SEP] [CLS] so we ' ##re go ##n na make two pieces at 24 plus 1 and a half because 1 by 8 is . [SEP] [CLS] so we ' ##re go ##n na have two long pieces that stick out . [SEP] [CLS] so we can put
[CLS] every one today we ' ##re in the basement i came down here before and the washing machine was running and there was water all over the floor . [SEP] [CLS] what has happened now because we always are having water leaks in the basement which we ' ##ll talk about in future shows . [SEP] [CLS] but i realized that the over ##flow not the over ##flow pipe but the the drain pipe for the washing machine was just dumping water as you see here . [SEP] [CLS] and we have to figure out what ' ##s wrong . [SEP] [CLS] so my first thing is i ' ##m thinking that one of the traps are cl ##og ##ged or there ' ##s a cl ##og in the main line . [SEP] [CLS] so we use a thing called a sewer snake or a drain snake or a snake drain drain snake to get that out . [SEP] [CLS] so i just want to show you a little bit about if you have a cl ##og ##ged drain how to fix it all right those cl ##og ##s in your drain system happen at what ' ##s called the trap . [SEP] [CLS] the trap is a little little loop at the bottom of the sink and if you ' ##ve ever looked underneath the sink and you see that the pipe come down and go like this and then out called a p trap that trap is there . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s called a trap because what it does is it traps any gases that might be coming from the sewer line it keeps them from going up into your sink and then making the house smell not nice um . [SEP] [CLS] so but when that bend is there hair can collect in there so . [SEP] [CLS] for grease you know marble ##s weird stuff can get stuck in the trap to clean out a trap you can if you ' ##re in a sink or a toilet you can use a plunge ##r . [SEP] [CLS] which is you know fairly effective . [SEP] [CLS] but if we ' ##re at the washing machine here or something like that you need a snake and if your plunge ##r does n ##' ##t work also . [SEP] [CLS] you have to move to a snake a snake is basically a wire like this . [SEP] [CLS] this is a snake it has kind of a spin ##y end on it here . [SEP] [CLS] and it is long and . [SEP] [CLS] as flexible this particular one is really cool because it rotate so you can rotate this and this goes out and this clean ##s out the drain . [SEP] [CLS] the pipe in other words . [SEP] [CLS] and it has a little hook on the end . [SEP] [CLS] and it will grab hopefully what ' ##s on the dogs
[CLS] i hate throwing out tools , especially tools that i think i can probably fix . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re doing a stain ##ing video right now , i ' ##m stain ##ing some pine doors and i made a huge mistake . [SEP] [CLS] here ' ##s our first coat , looks really nice . [SEP] [CLS] then we have a problem . [SEP] [CLS] i do n ##' ##t know what happened here . [SEP] [CLS] there ' ##s a link below to watch that video there . [SEP] [CLS] and i need to sand down one of the doors again , and i was like , well i need my palm sand ##er . [SEP] [CLS] both my palm sanders are broken . [SEP] [CLS] long story , but we were dry wall ##ing a 12 foot high ceiling and one of my team liked to sand down the butt joints with a palm sand ##er , and so he used my sanders . [SEP] [CLS] and i think i can fix them . [SEP] [CLS] t ' ##re broken now , i think it ' ##s an easy fix , and i thought let ' ##s just show people do n ##' ##t throw out your tools , take them apart , try and fix them . [SEP] [CLS] so today on garden fork , power tool repair . [SEP] [CLS] ( upbeat music ) i picked up a spray can of electronic cleaner . [SEP] [CLS] this stuff ' ##s handy to have around . [SEP] [CLS] and i got a phillips . [SEP] [CLS] these are really deep screw ##s here . [SEP] [CLS] do this on an area that it ' ##s okay to make a mess on . [SEP] [CLS] my counter is perfect for this . [SEP] [CLS] that comes off , put that somewhere safe . [SEP] [CLS] if you look down in here , you can see these are phillips screw ##s , so that works . [SEP] [CLS] sometimes t ' ##re torque ##s , which makes things a little more difficult sometimes . [SEP] [CLS] these are coming out , well this one comes out easy . [SEP] [CLS] so we ' ##ll take these out . [SEP] [CLS] you know , we had a tool bucket video the other day . [SEP] [CLS] today on garden fork , the tool bucket tour , blah . [SEP] [CLS] and i talked about these little different sets of drill bits i have , drill points , and this is go ##n na come in very handy for this ' ##ca ##use it ' ##s kind of hard to get out . [SEP] [CLS] so i ' ##m go ##n na take my deep , long , put it on my screw gun . [SEP] [CLS] this , to here , it ' ##s nice . [SEP] [CLS] ( drill buzzing ) there might be a screw

[CLS] everyone welcome to garden fork . [SEP] [CLS] today i want to talk to you about the troy built for cycle grass trim ##mer . [SEP] [CLS] plus i would call it . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m part of the saturday six blog ##ging group with troy both this year . [SEP] [CLS] and t sent us me . [SEP] [CLS] and t said would you like to check out a string trim ##mer . [SEP] [CLS] and i did n ##' ##t realize it . [SEP] [CLS] but it has a bunch of cool attachment ##s as well . [SEP] [CLS] so we ' ##re going to run through his paces today and show you what we think about it . [SEP] [CLS] this is a troy built for cycle string trim ##mer . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ve never owned a four cycle string trim ##mer for i was really intrigued by that because to cycle as we know you have to mix the oil and the gas and then put it into here . [SEP] [CLS] you never quite know if you ' ##ve got it mixed . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##ve done a video about that action . [SEP] [CLS] there ' ##s a link in the show notes um but this puppy . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s gas that you put in your tractor . [SEP] [CLS] you can put it in your four cycle trim ##mer always use gas stabilize ##r by the way that some oil in the crank case here boom it starts up you ' ##re ready to go . [SEP] [CLS] so it ' ##s more efficient runs cleaner easier to use all big plus ##es for me . [SEP] [CLS] the attachment ##s are easy to connect and disco ##nne ##ct pop this little button t come apart . [SEP] [CLS] and what ' ##s nice here is your string trim ##mer and become an edge trim ##mer just by putting this back in at a 90 degree angle like that . [SEP] [CLS] so now your trim ##mer is an edge trim ##mer for your sidewalks and . [SEP] [CLS] this has what ' ##s called a click and trim string head on it . [SEP] [CLS] you know sometimes you have to kind of it ' ##s just a pain basically to run the line through this this one while you ' ##re trim ##ming if the trim the line gets too short . [SEP] [CLS] you just tap this on the ground and this pops in this comes out more . [SEP] [CLS] and then it ' ##s trimmed to the right length by this blade right here . [SEP] [CLS] and i ' ##ve also i have n ##' ##t really used i ' ##ve been all around the yard . [SEP] [CLS] have n ##' ##t used much twin ##e at all it ' ##s not twin ##e string sorry

[CLS] today on garden ##for ##k , sharpe ##ning lawn ##mo ##wer blades . [SEP] [CLS] you ' ##d be surprised how dull these blades get , and if you have n ##' ##t sharpened them in a while , it ' ##s time to do it . [SEP] [CLS] i do it actually a couple times a year . [SEP] [CLS] the labrador ##s love the lawn ##mo ##wer because i throw the ball while i mo ##w the lawn . [SEP] [CLS] if i can do it , you can do it . [SEP] [CLS] first thing you wan na do , get some food plastic wrap from your kitchen . [SEP] [CLS] so make sure this is sealed really well . [SEP] [CLS] if that could screw back on , that would help . [SEP] [CLS] so take a look at your mo ##wer . [SEP] [CLS] whatever side of the mo ##wer has the gas cap on it , that side is go ##n na be tilted up so we can get to the mo ##wer blade . [SEP] [CLS] we do that so if there ' ##s any gas , it does n ##' ##t spill out the cap . [SEP] [CLS] it gets tilted like that . [SEP] [CLS] alright , inside this mo ##wer is a little dirt ##ier than i usually like . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m the one that prof ##esses you should always be cleaning the underside of your mo ##wer . [SEP] [CLS] but anyway , i ' ##m go ##n na show you how to take off the blade . [SEP] [CLS] get yourself a piece of scrap wood and a cl ##amp . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re go ##n na put this down here to keep the blade from moving when we undo the bolt , un ##sc ##rew the bolt . [SEP] [CLS] so this goes in here like this . [SEP] [CLS] put your wren ##ch on this bolt . [SEP] [CLS] do n ##' ##t use an adjustable wren ##ch . [SEP] [CLS] use the wren ##ch that ' ##s the right size . [SEP] [CLS] if i throw this , will you leave me alone ? [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s in okay shape , but definitely needs sharpe ##ning . [SEP] [CLS] so we ' ##re go ##n na go in the shop , do this up . [SEP] [CLS] this is really brilliant ##ly simple , and the sharpe ##r your blade , the health ##ier your grass because it cuts it clean rather than wa ##cki ##n ' it with a dull piece of metal . [SEP] [CLS] the ball ' ##s coming back . [SEP] [CLS] ( dog barking ) so the easiest way i found to sharpe ##n mo ##wer blades is with a right angle grind ##er that has a grinding wheel attachment .

[CLS] ( light music ) ( water splash ##ing ) ( dog panting ) she ' ##s heavy . [SEP] [CLS] hey everyone , welcome to garden fork . [SEP] [CLS] today , lawn mo ##wer tune up . [SEP] [CLS] yeah , believe it or not , you have to tune up your lawn mo ##wer , and if you do , it ' ##ll last a lot longer as well . [SEP] [CLS] and it ' ##s actually really .

[SEP] [CLS] you have to tune it up every year , change the oil a couple times that season and also every time you ' ##re done .

[SEP] [CLS] cause when you warm it up , you ' ##re getting the debris and mu ##ck out of the bottom of the engine . [SEP] [CLS] you ' ##re getting it all stirred up , and the oil will carry it out , because we ' ##re go ##n na drain the oil . [SEP] [CLS] so even if it ' ##s a warm day , it needs to be warmed up more ? [SEP] [CLS] right , you got to warm up your engine . [SEP] [CLS] ( lawn mo ##wer engine running ) you ' ##ve run your lawn mo ##wer

[SEP] [CLS] [ camera man ] yeah . [SEP] [CLS] this is a solar panel set up . [SEP] [CLS] i helped a buddy of mine put together , probably 10 years ago . [SEP] [CLS] is it 10 years , you think ? [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] i do n ##' ##t think it ' ##s been 10 years , but whatever . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s totally di ##y , and it works great . [SEP] [CLS] the most expensive thing is the solar panel and the batteries , but like the wiring and all that , it ' ##s low voltage , we did it ourselves . [SEP] [CLS] so i wan na walk you through it . [SEP] [CLS] ( dogs panting ) this is the back of the solar panel . [SEP] [CLS] it has some electronics here . [SEP] [CLS] and then it has this cord coming out . [SEP] [CLS] what this cord is , this is a outdoor rated heavy duty extension cord that we bought , from the big home improvement store .

[SEP] [CLS] so you can use it at night . [SEP] [CLS] you wan na see that ? [SEP] [CLS] quick , while she ' ##s looking for the ball . [SEP] [CLS] so we ' ##ve gone
