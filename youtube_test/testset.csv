Vid2,Animated Optical Illusion!,this is a very cool animated optical illusion I'm going to explain to you first how the illusions are prepared and then I'll show the illusion what you're looking at is an image that appears to be blurry but it's actually six frames of an animation now these frames are laid out in a specific way where each frame is cut into thin lines and you can see those lines and there is a specific space in between each one of these lines and then on this overlay that same space that same measurement between those spaces fits this overlay you can see the black and the white lines and those match up perfectly to the black and the white spaces on these images so that when you lay it over you end up with one image basically but as you move it those spaces cycle between each of those six frames creating movement [Music] you 
Vid3,Weird Water Experiment!,set and empty pan on the stove and turn the burner on I fill up a cup with water let the pan sit for two or three minutes what do you think will happen when you pour water into a pan that is hundreds of degrees it will evaporate almost instantly but if you let the pan sit for another two or three minutes with heat on high a very unusual thing happens you pour the water in but this time it doesn't vessels it almost looks like it's floating in the pan if you let these drops of water sit in the pan they will be there for hours even with the stove on high watch in slow motion as the water hits the pan and finally if you tilt the pan and allow the water to touch a surface that is cooler it will evaporate 
Vid4,Most Annoying Sound Ever!,this is how to make one of the loudest most annoying sounds ever cut a rectangular piece of paper about this size fold it in half and cut out two triangular pieces like this then fold the sides now just place it over your mouth and blow it's hard to hear the full effect on video try it yourself and you will see how incredibly loud this is 
Vid5,Papger Chinese Star! How To,[Music] 
Vid6,Animated Optical Illusion. How To!,this is a very cool animated illusion I'm going to show you how to make your own at home now at first it's a little difficult but once you get the hang of it it becomes a lot easier and then you'll be able to come up with your own designs so in order to make the animation that we just saw you'll start with one ball and then copy it five more times for a total of six ball now that's very important to remember all these animations will consist of six frames and you will use that number throughout this process so we have the six balls in any order that you want you can have them straight across or bouncing I just did mine in a straight line to keep it easy the next step will be to create this pattern now remember the number six because that will come into play in this design right here you have the black bars and you have the white space in between one of these black bars equals six of these white spaces so if you were to take one of these white spaces and lay it out six times it would equal the width of one of these black bars it's very important so once you make this you make it all the way across as long as you want as tall as you want but I have enough space to move it left and right and just make sure and keep that in mind you have to be very accurate or the other work now once you have this pattern and you have your objects laid out like this take the pattern and you lay it over your objects in whatever program you're using like Photoshop so this would be on one layer this would be on another layer and basically you want to crop out each ball with this pattern and when you move to the next ball you move this pattern over six spaces again the number six so let's say we lay this pattern over the first ball put it over you crop out this image on this ball so while you're left with is what looks like this on the first ball then you move this image over six spaces to the right one two three four five six crop the second moment then you move this image over six more spaces one two three four five six crop the third ball and you keep moving six spaces and cropping each object until you get to the end in which you're left with a pattern like this I picked these up at my local office supply store they're just transparencies and you can print right on top of these it needs to be transparent so you can see your black lines through the white spaces delay this over and as you move a little bit to the right you can see the next fall coming into play again again now I've made a couple of more designs I'll show you you 
Vid7,A Great Card Trick! How To,this is one of the best card tricks simply because it's so easy to do and not many people can figure out how it's done the idea of the trick is that you take a completely shuffled pack of cards you flip through them quickly memorizing all the cards and showing the audience that you were able to memorize all those cards in that quick of time first thing that you want to do is shuffle the deck to prove that there is no way you could have possibly memorized the cards beforehand and the next thing that you're gonna want to do is flip through very quickly so that you can memorize the cards okay I've just memorized those now I'll put the deck behind my back and I'm going to attempt to show that I've memorized the first card on the bottom of the pack now what I like to do is always get the first card wrong now what I like to do is always get the first card wrong to kind of throw the spectator off they won't think to get perfect it'll kind of let their guard down and you'll see later why that's important to get the first one wrong okay so I'm gonna go ahead and hold the pack out and say that I believe I've memorized that first card as being a three of Hearts well they're gonna say no you're wrong really okay well let's go and move on to the next one I am predicting that the next card not predicting but I've memorized the next card is an ace of clubs one other shocked so you go on and say okay I believe the next card was a queen of clubs am i right yeah you're right I'm going to the next card I believe the next card is five spades and the next card I believe there's a Queen of Hearts if I do remember I believe it should be ten of clubs and then it goes on to eight of diamonds and I believe ten of Spades now you can continue doing this to the entire pack you've literally memorized every card in the pack six of clubs you know what every card is coming up the next the next card is a four clubs very simple okay well now I'll show you how the trick is done and when you're ready you can just handle the pack and say look you can inspect the pack it's a regular deck of cards there's nothing tricky about this deck here's how the trick is done after you've shuffled the cards and then flip through them to memorize them you take the deck and you put it behind your back now when you put it behind your back you're gonna predict what this first card is not predict but show that you've memorized it at the same time you take this back card flip it over you put it on the back and when you bring this pack out to the front you're showing them at the bottom card you say I predict this is the ace of spades they're gonna say haha you're wrong got you well in the meantime you're looking at this next card on the back which is a three of diamonds so now when you take this back behind your back you take the three diamonds put it on the front and then set your next card up to the mirai's so now you say you know what I think the next card is gonna be a three of diamonds there it is now at the same time when you're showing them that with your peripheral vision you're looking at this card and know what the next car is gonna be at five diamonds so now you just said whoa three diamonds right right so now you know that what the next part can be put it on front and flip the next card over a lot of diamonds right now we already know what the next cards gonna be seven space take it back behind your back just coat around front put this one over seven of Spades right right next card is the eight of clubs now when you're ready for them to inspect the pack on your last time you know you're gonna hand it over to them just leave this back hard flipped over and then hand in the pack here you go 
Vid8,Did You Think Of This? (battery back up tip),most people think of a battery backup being used with computers so you can save files in case of a power outage here's another idea that seems very simple but can actually be very useful recently my city was hit by a big storm and the power was knocked out for almost two days I always keep a battery backup plugged in and charged in case of an emergency like this here are some different ways you can use your battery backup you can use it to power a lamp my cell phone battery ran out so I plugged it up to the battery backup for a full charge I needed my digital camera to take pictures of the damage caused by the storm so I plugged it in and got a full charge and to keep track of the storm I plugged in this portable TV even with all these devices plugged in the charge on this battery backup would last for over three hours using a battery backup this way can definitely make a difficult situation a little easier

Vid11,Amazing Card Trick Explained! Easy!,hello everyone this is a very simple card trick I'm going to perform the trick first and then I'll show you how it's done you take a normal deck of cards shuffle them what I'm going to do is try to find a particular card in this case I'm going to find the nine of Hearts just by cutting the deck bring in a card forward putting it on top nine of Hearts here it is before you start the trick note the bottom card queen of clubs when you shuffle shuffle this side first then finish queen of clubs is still in bottom now mix the cards up as much as you'd like but the bottom card will always stay the same queen of clubs this is how when you're pulling cards you pull them off the top and bring it right back down to the bottom the bottom card will always stay the same no matter how much you do queen of clubs so now you always know where that card is it's on the bottom at this point you can finish the trick any way you like I like to cut the deck there's our queen of clubs then I bring it out put it on top flip it over 
Vid12,The Best Card Trick In The World!,this is the best car trip in the world we'll go ahead and spread the pack out a little bit have someone pick a card will randomly pick any card in this case it is the three of clubs then we'll go ahead and start your shuffle to pack a little bit have them tell you when to stop we'll say stop now or now out of the matter we'll go ahead and take this card bring Club place it in pack where is that and will magically move our hand over the deck and we'll say the magic word spread the deck out and your card will show itself magically as you can see there is a blue card now and it actually will go ahead and turn that card over and reveal that it is and easy to plug the card that you pick we'll turn it back over and if you didn't really get that I'll go ahead and talk to you again in slow motion again we will shuffle the deck you say when we stop let's say they say stop now we've got the five of diamonds place it on top say the magic word spread the cards out and again we will hopefully see your card reveal itself and a blue card they're going to seem to be a blue card in here well there is this one gear we'll turn that over and it is pilot done this is the reveal to the best card trick in the world this is a normal deck of red card except for the very bottom card which is blue in this case is five of diamonds you go through the regular red pack and find the other five diamonds so you have two five of diamonds put your red buy the diamonds on the bottom and then you take the Blue Bottle diamond to put it on the very bottom next you spread the card down try out to show the red bottom card which is blue and have them pick a card okay to pick this one there cases take that next thing we'll do is call Hindi couple it looks like you're making the cards up but in reality you're just taking card on the top of deck leaving the bottom impact still have the blue 5 diamond for the red 5 the bottom zir continue to shuffle and tell you so you stop and hit at a stop now I tell you stop and pick your card place it in the middle of the pack you still have your body diamonds right here take the 5 of diamonds on top of a two part way to handle it attack say the magic word and spread the pack out when you spread to a counterpart well magically heal itself man there it is blue part picks it back out and this is where it looks like I turn your card over defy the diamond but what you actually do is grab in such a way that you turn two cards over at the same time making it look like you're turning one card over and when you turn this to over you're actually turning the car they pick again you reach down you turn over to cards putting the blue back on top so it looks like you turned over their party departs but in reality we weren't you returning out if I'm dying so you take that out they think if that's your car to eat apart you tell them what this drink in this one must you pick up this pack and now you have the original red by the diamond still here and put it up on tell them again I'm gonna couples pack slowly in do a couple making up the car but you still have those red spotted I'm in the bottom tell you to stop tell them ok your card is a pot of diamonds I'm gonna place it down on the pack lay my hand over the deck spread the cards out when I look for your card to show itself but it doesn't seem to be coming out there's no blue card well actually there is blue card right here turn over into the by the ducks 
Vid13,Incredible 3D Paper! How To,you 
Vid14,Rubiks Cube Illusion!,this is a very simple but cool illusion there's a water bottle sitting on top of a Rubik's Cube right look again it's just a piece of paper here's how to do it place the Rubik's Cube on a desk and then put another object behind it to give it some feeling of depth position your camera and take a picture bring your picture to the computer then print it out now just position the print out where the Rubik's Cube was then take another picture try this with other objects and angles be creative have fun 
Vid15,"Magic Money Maker, Revealed!",I'm going to show you how to print your own money at home it's very easy to do all you need is a blank piece of paper in the shape of a dollar bill and your money making device which basically consists of two pens two rollers and this cardboard frame to hold it all together so what you want to do is just take your blank dollar bill and start it in the backside of your money printer and just start to turn one of your pens and it'll instantly start printing your money and there you have your printed bill just like that is the real dollar bill you can spend anywhere these are the materials that you'll need to make your money-making device you can use different materials if you would like these are just the ones that I've chosen first thing you want to do is print out a piece of paper that's black on both sides and I just printed out two pieces and tape them together in the middle so I have a nice long piece and then you can make your cardboard frame just like this you can make it out of wood or any other material take one of your pens and put it through the top then you take your black piece of paper one end of it have a piece of tape on the end and you can just tape it around the pen start to roll your piece of paper all the way onto the pen okay now once you've rolled this piece of paper around this pen you have another piece of tape at the end like this go ahead and put your other pin through on the bottom here's what the trick comes in you want to reverse the tape onto the other pen so put it through the middle like this come to the other side tape it on to the pin here like this then turn the pan the opposite direction you'll see what it does so now you've got your two rollers that you want to appear like or separate rollers two black pads but in reality the black goes from one roller down to the other take your dollar bill and put it in one side start to turn it and it's going to pull the dollar bill inside of your rollers you can see it's not coming out of the other side because the black paper is reversed so it just stores it inside now your dollar bill is stored inside the roller and all you have to do is take your blank piece put it in the other side and turn it the opposite direction so when it pulls the blank piece in pushes the dollar bill out and there's your money-making device 
Vid16,"Rubiks Cube Speed Secret, Revealed!",I picked up this new Rubik's Cube to show what most people go through when trying to work the cube it's very stiff and resistant it's hard to make fast and accurate moves well here's a secret the pros don't want you to know they lubricate the cube here's how first you'll need a can of silicone spray and a flat blade screwdriver turn your cube to this position and gently pry the middle piece out now just spray a little bit of silicone inside now snap the middle piece back in then work the cube for about five minutes you will notice a huge difference just with the small snap of your finger you can rotate aside easily and quickly and it allows you to perform multiple moves in one movement this is how the pros get super fast times by performing this hack I was able to knock off an average of 15 or 20 seconds from solving the cube and now you can too 
Vid17,"Magic Stick Trick, Revealed!",basically have a stick with two sides both sides contain six colors the colors are the same on both sides I'll ask you to pick a number between one and six now let's say that you that you picked three so I'll start with the blue and I'll count three one two three your magic color is going to be orange I'll give the stick a couple more flips rub the orange a little more and magically the stick turns orange now we've got one side with our six colors and we've got the other side that's on inch if we rub the orange side a little bit then both sides turn orange if we tap it we're back to six colors with the ones on one side six cloves in the other tap it again we've got multi colors on both sides this dick has six colors on one side and one color on the other side so to make it look like it's got six colors on both sides when you turn the stick you twist it at the same time so you're actually just showing the same sign when you twist it to do it fast enough it looks like you're showing both signs you want to force the audience to always pick orange so when you ask them to pick a number between one and six you can always end up on orange if they pick the number one you spell it out oh and E if they pick the number two TW oh if they pick the number three one two three so let's say they pick the number five will spell it out fi ve your magic number your magic color is going to be orange so we give the stick a couple of turns we rub the magic color give it another flip and it turns orange now we have six colors on one side and the magic color on the other side but if you about this here we have orange on both sides and then we're back to the multi color stick you 
Vid18,Best Camera Trick Ever!,have you ever tried to achieve that perfect pan but no matter how hard you try it never turns out right no one's hand is perfectly steady and most $50 tripods like mine have a very cheap pan head that makes it almost impossible to achieve a smooth pan the secret to achieving perfectly smooth pans a plain old rubber band just hook the rubber band around the handle on your tripod then pull the rubber band acts as a shock absorber between your hand and the handle so any unwanted moves by your hand gets absorbed by the rubber band leaving you with a perfectly smooth pan look how smoothly you can go from a pan to a stationary shot because the tension in the rubber band is becoming less and less the movement of the camera gradually slows down until it stops here's a before-and-after [Music] so stop getting frustrated trying to get that perfect shot find a rubber band and start to pan [Music]

Vid21,"Hanging A Frame On A Brick Wall, Drill Into The Cement or Brick?","- Hey, how are ya? This used to be, well this used to be here then it fell off. Why did it fall off? Well, because the person who put it on here didn't do it as good as we will today, let's just say that. The wire broke, the nail came out of the mortar. So I wanna show today, how to hang picture frames, mirrors, and stuff like that on brick walls. Ready, here we go. Make, fix, grow, cook, garden fork. Are your excited about this, are you? (dog barking) You're very excited about this project, all right, let's go. All right, let's talk about stuff that you're gonna need. The key piece is a hammer drill, we'll talk more about that. These are masonry percussive drill bits. Ear protection, dust protection, eye protection. For this job some plastic anchors, and a vacuum. So we need to fix this wire here. Let me show you what I'm gonna do. This is a galvanized, braided hanging wire okay. I'm gonna take this out. (light music) And I tie a double knot in it. And I bring this over here. Some people will just fold this, will just wrap this on itself like this and it'll grab, but I like to tie it. And now you're good to go. So we're all set, we fixed the mirror wire, we're gonna hang this thing up, drill a hole boom, done, we're out right, wrong. We have to kind of talk about the elephant in the room, and that's the controversy that are on my other videos whether to drill into the brick, or the masonry joint between the brick. Let me show you show you why I drill into the brick. So here's out brick wall where we're gonna hang our mirror, right. Brick, mortar, but look here, (metal scrapping) I work in old buildings all the time. But brick is much more solid than the mortar most of the time. You can argue below with the comments, I'd love to hear what you think, but I drill into the brick, I don't go into the mortar. (light music) so, let's go over the tools for a minute okay. This is a hammer drill, it is corded, it's not cordless, doesn't have a battery. It plugs into the wall. It is a percussive hammer and rotary drill in one. They're not that expensive, I'll link below to the one that I use. If you're doing any DIY projects that you're gonna do stuff in the future, this the one drill to buy, it's gonna last you forever. It's gonna save you a lot of headaches. There's sometimes where cordless drills just don't have the torque you need to really unscrew something, or slam something in. So this, and a set of masonry bits, percussive masonry bits, hammer drill bit starter set, I'll link below. Hammer drill, hammer drill bits, one time investment, lifetime of pain free hanging of stuff, cement, brick, okay, did I make my point? Oh that wasn't very elegant it? I forgot to take my glasses off, I guess so. Eye protection, ear protection 'cause this drill screams, okay. If you're gonna hang a TV into brick, don't use this, use what's called a sleeved anchor. I'll link below to information about these, and these, and all the other tools. I highly suggest using a vacuum or a shop vac. I like these because they're light weight, you can hold the hose up. When you're gonna drill in the brick, brick dust is gonna come out and if you don't catch it right away, it goes, well, it goes everywhere, so it's a good thing. One last thing, I always start the drilling on regular rotary drill setting, and then, once I get a point made in the brick or cement, or tile or whatever, I flip it over to hammer and then I go. If you start with hammer, this can jump, so start and make little divot, kinda like if you're drilling through metal you set a little point, you're setting a little point on rotary (vocalizing drill noise) just a little bit, go to hammer, (vocalizing hammer drill) and you're in. (drill screaming) remember when I warned you about the screaming part, here we go. (drill screaming) (hammer banging) Oh, great. (drill screaming) (hammer banging) That's what I get for using the masonry bit that came with the screws and the anchors. I'm gonna use my real hammer drill bit and make that the true diameter for our anchors. The real bit, real tight, good to go. (drill screaming) (hammer banging) (light music) So I'm gonna stop and leave a gap so our wire can go behind that. That, is not going anywhere. All right, we've got the new super strong braided wire, hang that right here, center that, and that is a beautiful thing. Am I a beautiful thing? You can let me know in the comments, be nice to me okay? So it should be floating right here with some other videos. More about me, click the down arrow below the video to find out about the kind of drill, drill bits, sleeves, anchors, all about Eric's World right below. So go out, do cool stuff, come back and tell be about it. All right, make a great day, I'll see you later. "
Vid22,2nd Version Homemade Maple Syrup Evaporator | Make Maple Syrup | GardenFork,"- Welcome to version 2.0 of the file cabinet maple syrup evaporator. This is Charlie pup's whale. (laughs) Are you ready to go? Do you wanna learn about the evaporator? Drop. Here we go. - [Announcer] Make, fix, grow, cook. Garden fork. (instrumental music) - Drop. So, I made kind of a quickie video about this a while ago but, I want to give you a detailed walk through of improvements I've made and some improvements that you could make when you build this thing and I always learn from you guys so comments or questions below okay. Let's take a look. So our first evaporator was steam table pans dropped in a file cabinet. Worked super great. A bunch of people made them and that was really kinda cool and actually I decided to upgrade so I gave my version one cabinet to my neighbor down the road who's very happy with that. But let's walk through some of the improvements I made. First of all I just left the pieces of metal between the drawers in here to support the new tray and then I put in, I kept the expanded steel grating here and you might want to consider using straight sheet-metal here instead of the expanded steel and I'll talk about that a little more later. The other thing I did was, when you were boiling with version 1.0 the steam tunnel trace. when this thing was whomping, you couldn't get too close to the cabinet 'cause it would melt your pants. (laughs) So I bought inexpensive firebrick. I got these at the blue store. They're thin, they look more like a patio brick. - [Female] Yeah. - But they're used for aligning wood stoves and they were about three bucks a piece if I remember correctly. They weren't really expensive and I put those in here just being held in by gravity. I didn't wire them in or anything but that helped a lot in reflecting the heat back in to the cabinets instead of out and melting my clothes. It was hot, you would be like - [Female] Then you'd have more sewing to do. - Yeah. (laughs) - We have a video about sewing machines. The sewing machines is the original 3-D printer. (laughs) I'll link in the show notes here. You gotta click the little down button to see more about me. - [Female] He loves sewing. - I love it. - [Female] Love this husband. - Yeah. (instrumental music) So what I was trying to do here with the copper coil around the chimney stack and this as well, this set along the side here, was to try and preheat the sup that was coming off of our tank and it just didn't work very well. I don't know, I'll have to work on it. Maybe putting the copper coil inside the chimney stack might work better, maybe I should have better contact. It didn't really contact with the sheet-metal very well but maybe you guys have some solutions for that. Please tell me in the comments below or make one of these and make a video. It'd be even better. - [Female] Tell them quickly. - Yeah. - It's almost sap season. (laughs) - It's almost sap season. But then I ran it, I had this connected to the side of the cabinet and it did okay. So I had these clips. - [Female] Oh yeah. - And that sat in like that. - [Female] Oh okay. - And then this was my adjustable valve to dribble sap into the beginning of the tray. It worked okay. I'd really like to make a gravity feed valve. I don't know if you've seen those on a professional sap evaporator. But it's just, as the moisture evaporates, the water evaporates off the tray, the valve opens and lets in more sap. It's really cool. My friend Bill down the road has one. I'm trying to DIY one, if you have some ideas, let me know. But so the dribble thing it worked okay. Throw the ball, make another video. - [Female] That's a stick. - Oh. (laughs) Come take a look here. So this is literally just some galvanized pipe that I think I got in a job somewhere. Our neighbor was throwing it out, I don't know, you can find some but I really think there should be a damper here, like a wood stove damper. - [Female] Oh yeah yeah. Like a flap thing? - Yeah, just to control the draw because you'll see when this thing is whomping the problem with this evaporator I had was, it just burned too fast. All the heat is going out the chimney rather than hitting the bottom of the pan. So the beauty of this design is it takes palette-size wood and that's what I burn mainly. I mean I'm surrounded by woods but palettes are free and pre-cut. (laughs) That's frozen shut. We had an ice storm last night. There we go. Come on door, open. - [Female] I'm holding the door. - But the beauty is, the palette wood - [Female] Oh yeah, good fit. - It fits right in. (instrumental music) We have a whole bunch of videos about how to tap trees, how to boil sap with a propane turkey deep fryer if you want or you can build one of these great things. Alright, quick while she's gone. Now the coolest thing here is this. - [Female] It is cool. - There's a guy who I'm gonna link to in the show notes here who made me this evaporator and he shipped it to me and its amazing quality at a very reasonable price. So I'll link to him below or you can also go on our website and learn about that. But this really up my game from the steam table trays to a real evaporator tray. See we custom made this to fit the file cabinet. - [Female] Beautiful. - That's really nice. - [Female] Have it all set? - I love fire, controlled fire. - [Female] Yeah. - It's a good thing. What I still need to fine-tune is the airflow. I hook up a bathroom fan to this connection down here I have and it works okay but I still need to be better about that. There's a really great forum, discussion forum, on MapleTrader.com. It's like old-school guys are really, kinda happy to give advice and I think that's great. I'm still gonna fire this up and boil some water. (laughs) By the way, before you start your fire or right after like we're gonna do, get sap in here. So this tray has three channels. The sap goes in here, travels down here, goes through a little notch in the wall, goes across, comes back, goes across again and out there is our output valve. - [Female] Oh yeah, right there. - So I don't finish the sap in this tray, I get it really close and I pour it off and then I finish it on a propane burner. I think that's a lot easier. But you'd be amazed how you watch how the sap starts to concentrate as it moves through here. It's really pretty cool. So let's talk about some improvements if you're gonna build this. We addressed this in version 3.0 but I think the firebox is too big and I liked it because you can just rip palettes up and throw them in here, right. But, it burns really fast. So one thing to do is to put a baffle halfway through here. You could build it with brick and sand, you could have two pieces of steel, one going down and one going up so the air, you wanna create a turbulence so that the heat lingers here a little more if that makes any sense. - [Female] Are you a bellow? - Yeah. I don't have the fan hooked up so I'm blowing air on it. (laughs) (dog barks) But with a little bit of that propane torch 'cause I didn't put enough paper cardboard in, this is burning nicely. So we'll just close this up. I close it up almost all the way. Let this fire flag a half hour and it'll get to boiling. It'll be nice. (instrumental music) Version 3.0 is thanks to my friend Brendan who took this, took my ideas, my videos and made it even better. So here's a quick glimpse of version three. (instrumental music) Shortened firebox, a little more modification. I'm gonna build one of these in my shop and then that video should be floating here if it's ready. If not, you can watch all our other file cabinet evaporator, how to tap trees, how to boil sap with a propane burner. It's all doable. You can do it. If I can do it, you can. So let me know, I learn from you okay, so let me know what you think in the comments, right. Make it a great day. Throw the stick for your Labradors, right. See you. "
Vid23,Simple Solar Panel Setup For DIY Geeks Like You and Me - GardenFork,"- You wanna learn how to install a really simple solar panel set-up, pretty inexpensive? You can run some stuff in your cabin, or your house, or even your apartment? - [Camera Man] Yeah. - All right. Here we go. This is a solar panel set-up I helped a buddy of mine put together, probably 10 years ago. Is it 10 years, you think? - [Woman] I don't think it's been 10 years, but whatever. Go ahead. - It's totally bulletproof. It's totally DIY, and it works great. Really simple. The most expensive thing is the solar panel and the batteries, but like the wiring and all that, it's low voltage, we did it ourselves. So I wanna walk you through it. Okay? (dogs panting) This is the back of the solar panel. Pretty standard. It has a frame. It has some electronics here. And then it has this cord coming out. What this cord is, this is a outdoor rated heavy duty extension cord that we bought, from the big home improvement store. I'll link to some of them and the solar panel we use, in the notes below the video, here. - [Woman] Did it used to be yellow? - Yeah, it's got a little dirt on it, a little mold and stuff. (woman laughing) - [Woman] A decade worth. - But this is really simple. We picked the part of the yard that had the most sun exposure. You're gonna have to experiment a little bit and move the panel around. And then we just put in a simple galvanized pole. We built a bracket to hold it on, with some pipe, plumbing pipe. And then, we just did a really simple trench, all the way to the cabin. - [Woman] What're they doin'? - They're lookin' for their tennis balls. So this works best in sunlight, but the beauty of this, is we have some battery storage in the basement of the cabin, which it takes the solar power from the brightest part of the day and stores the electricity so you can use it at night. You wanna see that? Okay quick, while she's looking for the ball. So we've gone from our solar panel, and we just used a straight edge shovel, and we cut a slot in the yard, making sure there's no other power lines around. The Call Before You Dig calls important here. And then, we just cut a little trench, about three, four inches down. Excuse me. Henry! Into the cabin over here. Irony is, there's no lights in the basement, where the electricity's being stored. This is the battery maintainer, controller. Fairly inexpensive. Again, I'll link to it in the notes below the video here. The cable comes in from the solar panel, and then with some batteries right below here. We're using a deep cycle golf cart battery. You can buy batteries specifically for solar panels. Car batteries won't work, because they're not built for what's called deep discharge. Golf cart batteries are. They're not cheap, but they work well. They're right down here. (dog barks) And a Labrador wants us to throw the ball. - [Woman] In the basement? - In the basement. (dog barks) (dog panting) Girls! So we've run 12 volt wire up into the cabin. Underneath here, I've got 12 volt fluorescent light bulbs. (switch clicks) - [Woman] Oh! Shiny. - No utility poles, no nothin' and you've got nice light to do your cooking by. (switch clicks) Save energy. Over here in the living room, we've got it set up where you can plug in cell phone chargers, and we also run an AM/FM radio, all off of 12 volt power, which is really nice. You can get car power adapter style receptacles that'll mount in your drywall. I'll link to those below. You can charge your cell phone. You can split off to do multiple things. And you can run your radio. (dance music) (woman laughing) We can't play too much of that or YouTube gets mad at us. Even if you're on the grid, but you want to reduce your dependence on the grid, solar panel, some deep cycle batteries. I'll link to more information below, about it, but I just want to share with you what's possible, with solar panels. - [Woman] Oh, hello. (woman laughing) - All right, there you go. There should be some stuff floating here to click on, to watch more Garden Fork videos. More information about this is below, but I'd love to hear from you. I learn from you. Do you have a solar panel set-up? Do you want more ans-? What's that? (dog barks) I'll try and answer your questions. - [Woman] You want more ants. (dog barks) - And I'm losing my voice. I'll see you later. (dog barking) "
Vid24,Almost Free Brick Pizza Oven | Wood Fired Pizza In Your Backyard - GardenFork.TV,"- You wanna make the easiest brick pizza oven ever? - [Woman] Yeah! - Here we go. Make, fix... grow, cook. Garden Fork. (relaxed jazzy music) You wanna go seven bricks across, and you want to center those across the saw horses. Wanna put my nicer bricks in the center. Some of these are charred. You can see these are from our previous pizza ovens. That's a good sign. So this is our base. Now we're gonna built our side walls, the back, and the top. (relaxed jazzy music) If you got some cement on the end of a brick, you can usually just break it off. Wear some safety glasses, okay? And then this will chip off. (hammering) (scraping) Nice. (relaxed jazzy music) So I keep the fire burning in the middle of the oven. And this looks pretty good here. I got an old hoe, and I just take this whole thing, and I push it back to the back of the oven. - [Woman] Don't push it through - And we don't, we wanna be careful with the wood. We don't want a log incident, like we had in a previous episode. (woman laughs) I'll link to that at the end of the show. This just makes me look happy, look at this. The heat here is hot enough that I can't be too close to this because my hands are burning. (scraping) So I don't mind the coal ash, it's wood ash okay. It's gonna be on the bottom of the pizza, and that's okay with me. - [Woman's Voice] Oh, there we go. Look's good. - I'm gonna be making a new pizza dough video. This was kinda an experiment. See how it slides on here? - [Woman] Yeah. - Cause it's cornmeal, it's like ball bearings okay. I mean, this isn't a 900 degree oven. It's probably a 400 degree oven, so it might be five minutes a side. We're gonna pull it out and spin it halfway through. That's what I found works pretty good. But the bottom, those bricks are super hot. The top of the oven... You can't really see it, but the top and middle of the oven is white, and that means it's attained a really high temperature there. - [Woman] I can't see it. - And I can see the pizza cooking. - [Woman] It looks good. Oh, I smell it now. It smells like pizza. - That's amazing, just from some bricks in your yard. - [Woman] I see that. Did you see that bubble? - Yeah. (acoustic music) (woman laughs) - [Woman] The crust is kinda toast. - It's a little burnt, that's okay. - [Woman] What is the goal, for the cheese to be melted on the top? - For the dough to be cooked. But you can see here where I accidentally ripped it, the dough is definitely cooked. That's beautiful. So this crust wasn't burnt by the brick. It was burnt by it being a little too close to the fire, and me just kind of staring at the fire and forgetting about it. But this is good, huh? - [Woman] I don't know, did you try it yet? - We're going to right now, you're going to watch me. I just use scissors to cut pizza. - [Woman] Those are outdoor scissors? - Nice crust. That's good. - [Woman] That's your medium well face. - No, the smoke is coming out here and burning my eyes. - [Woman] (laughs) Otherwise it would be fantastic? - And it's in your driveway you know? You can do this. All sorts of questions, let me know in the comments below. Lot of people are helpful to answer questions, I answer them. There should be some videos floating right here. You can click on those, watch our other pizza videos, or our most recent creations. Mmm, make your oven, and then make this. Pizza dough, there's some videos... This smoke is a bit much. - [Woman] (laughs) He's going. "
Vid25,You Can Weld! - Flux Core Welding Basics - GardenFork,"- Today on GardenFork, first time flux core welding. Here we go. Make, fix, grow, cook, GardenFork. Hey, it's me, how you doing, welcome to Garden Fork. Today I'm working on my new maple syrup evaporator and I wanted to show you a tool I have that if you're thinking about you'd like to do some welding from time-to-time, you don't need to spend a huge amount of money buying gas and a mig welder and stuff like that. You can also get an inexpensive flux core welder. And before everyone piles on me, this is just for occasional stuff. You wanna fix your mower deck or something like that. Just wanna show you what I do and maybe you guys might wanna try it as well. Alright, let's go. Okay, full disclosure, I am an amateur welder. I've taken a welding class, I learned a lot, but I am, by all means, an amateur. This is more me trying to get you guys interested in maybe trying welding for yourself, if you've never done it, or if you just wanna have a welder rig that from time-to-time you wanna fix something. I think this will make you happy. This is my favorite part, the hood. This is a 90 amp flux core welder that I got from Harbor Freight. It's about $100, you might be able to catch it on sale. What flux core means is that there is flux inside the metal welding wire that comes out of the tip here. That also means that this thing puts off a lot of smoke, so do this in a well ventilated area. I usually do it outside or in my garage here. Don't do this inside in a basement shop, okay. But the beauty of this is it's inexpensive, it'll weld thin metals, and with a little practice, you can get really good at this. I'm just kind of a rank amateur, but this will really with my evaporator. So I wanted to show you just this welding that I'm gonna do and we'll go from there, alright. This is some of the gear I think you need. I have safety glasses on, underneath my welding helmet. I have a grinding wheel on a cordless drill. This is a little hammer to knock off the slag. These magnets are real handy to put things at a 90 degree or 45 degree angle, to hold them while you weld. These are additional welding tips. A right angle grinder with a cutoff wheel for working with metal. Some vice grips and welding gloves. As far as what you should wear, wear stuff that you don't mind getting ruined. Flux core throws off a lot of splatter. Ideally, I would have a leather welding jacket on, I don't know if I weld enough to buy one of those, but this is my work coveralls that I don't mind getting messed up. But with the long sleeve, leather gloves, I should be good to go. Also, heavy duty boots. Don't wear anything like rubber gloves, anything that you think might burn, don't wear it. This kind of helmet I really like. It's solar powered, it was inexpensive, it's from Harbor Freight as well. They don't work very well in cold weather, okay, so has to be fairly warm to do this. Do not use, these are for gas acetylene welding and they're not good for flux core because flux core puts off some UV light and you wanna have your complete face covered so you're not getting UV light on your skin. That's why you're wearing the long sleeves, gloves, et cetera. Don't do this, okay, this, not good. Okay, cleaned that up with the grinder. So we want bare metal to do our welding. Really neat corner magnets, this sits here, connects to that, and that will hold the bar in place while we're doing the weld. I learned a lot from a couple of YouTube videos. One guy named Chuck has a really great instructional voice. I'll link to those, I built a whole welding playlist to learn more about this flux core welding. This is your tip. This unscrews, by the way, and then inside you will see, that is the welding tips that you need to replace from time-to-time. So I suggest buying some extra ones, they're pretty cheap. This is the part that goes over here. And then this is the flux core wire, which you're going to weld with. Depending on your preferences, I would say 3/4 of an inch coming out of here. About like that, we're good to go. When you're ready to weld, I like to put on safety glasses and then my hood. I'm all set. Welding gloves, again these are inexpensive at the store. I just gotta get them over my cuffs. But long is good. Kinda looks like the Crafsman puppet. I don't know if you watch the Crafsman YouTube channel. He's phenomenal. Leather gloves, okay. So because this is an old filing cabinet, there's a bit of a gap between my angle iron and the metal we wanna weld, so I'll do my best. I'm gonna tack weld here and tack weld down there. And then you wanna hold this at a roughly, there's so many videos and theories about how to hold this, but basically, at a 45 and then tilt it forward a little bit and you're going to drag the weld along. You don't wanna push, you want to drag. This way the flux is going to flow into here and the slag that builds up will be after the weld, not before the weld. So we're gonna go like this. And we will weld. I've cleaned off another area to put our clamp, the other electrode. This is your spool and wire feed. The instructions are pretty good about this. I will say be careful with this spool, it will unwind very quickly. Always keep tension on this when you're working with it. This is what happened to me when I was first putting that spool on and I let it go accidentally, this went all over the place. There's some good instructions, some videos about working with this. Which I don't need to cover. But what is nice, is this has some settings to start going. This is a little bit different, because it's a thicker piece of steel I'm gonna weld to this other steel. But I'm gonna go with the beginning suggested setting here and we are good to go. (zapping) That's an awful weld. Part of my problem is there's a gap here I'm trying to fill and I'm an amateur welder. I'm gonna tack the edges here, and I think that will do a pretty good job of keeping this in one place. If you've welded before, you have to clean this up before you weld again. (zapping) Alright, a little better, I'm learning. So this little hammer here is to clean up that slag. Okay, not perfect. That giant hole there is a problem, but a much better weld than over here. Alright, that first weld was not good. Second on a little better. You know, I learn as I go. What is nice is that the Harbor Freight one actually has a little photo guide as to things you could be doing wrong. I need to get better at the wire feed speed and also, I hold the tip a little too far out. You know, you get better at it. And then they also have instructions on how to do the spool feed too. But I like this, I could learn from that. I'm gonna trim my tip back, like that. And we're gonna go here. (zapping) Alright, not great, but it'll hold. See again, my tip is too far out. Well, it'll hold, it's nothing I'm too proud of, but. (zapping) Okay, so here it was too much power and I blew a hole in the thing. And then I dialed down the voltage and that looks much better. It just takes a little practice. Alright, that's still not beautiful, but that's better than where we started, you know. - [Woman] Woo, that was good. Alright, thanks for watching. Again, I'm just learning how to do this. I wanted to turn you on to the idea of a flux core welder. Right here should be some more videos, I made a playlist of a lot of the videos that I learned how to do this, because I'm an expert now, right. - [Woman] He said no. - Make it a great day. - [Woman] You're an expert ball thrower. - I'm very good at throwing the ball. I'm gonna build a ball launcher with my welder. - [Woman] What will you do with your time? (laughs) - Watch t.v. See ya! - [Woman] Bye. "
Vid26,Hang a TV On The Wall - GardenFork,"- Alright, so you just got your new flat panel tv and you want to put it on your drywall or sheetrock wall using one of these TV mounts. Today I'm going to show you how to do that, it's really easy, even I can do it. And if I can do it, you can do it. Ready? Here we go. So, step one is you want to figure out where on the wall you want this to be. This really helps to have two or maybe three people help you. You want to figure out roughly where you want it and then using a pencil, a light pencil ideally, you're going to mark, and I dropped the pencil, hold on. Like I said, this is better with a couple of people. So, you want to mark with your pencil the outside edges, on both sides. So, we know in this area here, ideally, we need to find a stud. And a stud is the two by four, wood two by four, or a metal stud that is behind the sheetrock that we can drive into. I'm going to show you how to do it into a stud and if you can't find the stud, what to do. Okay? This is a pretty cool stud finder, you can buy a bunch of them at the store. (knocking) I think that there is one here. (beeping) Ah, There we go. You can also sometimes look along, if you have your eye and you shine a light back this way you can see where the wall kind of mounds out a little bit. Where the joint compound went over the joint and that's where a stud is, as well. Another way you can do it, is, since this is going to be covered by a big TV panel, is you can just drill holes until you hit the stud. (drilling) (knocking) What do you think, about right there? (drilling) It feels like it. Lets get a screw and see. Drywall screw, lets see. (drilling) Yeah, that's a stud. If it's not a stud, it does this. (drilling) Just spins. So we're lucky in that there is a stud like smack in the middle of where we want to mount this thing. But this thing is fairly wide so I want some screws at each end as well. So we're going to mark and find holes to drill for our drywall screws, which I'll show you. This is a really great, it's called a torpedo level, but it's magnetic, so you can put it on here and it grabs right on. It doesn't go anywhere. Alright, I moved this into position, checked my marks for positioning and now I'm going to look at the level and make sure it is level. And then I'm going to draw, I'm going to outline that oval and then the other side I'm going to outline the oval as well. If you have a heavier TV, a larger TV, I would suggest marking the bottom holes as well as marking the top holes here. Use these, not these. These are what came with your TV mount, and they mean well, but these are all a couple bucks and they work much better and they're easier to use as well. It's called a Snap Toggle. I don't get paid by these people, but I just think they have the best product right now. I'll link in the show notes, if you want to buy these online. They also sell them at your local hardware store. These, big TV, this, bad. Okay? Use this. So let me show you on a piece of sheetrock how these things work. Half inch drill bit. (drilling) Go through like that. Okay? This is the part we see. This is the part in your wall. Okay? This is our snap toggle, and we bend this this way, and then push it through. So we're now sticking out like this and we're going to push this through and what's happening is it's coming out the other side, like that. So this is inside the wall now. And then we pull this back, and when you pull it back, that snaps up against the drywall or sheetrock. And we're good. So we've pulled this so it's snug up against there. We hold this back part here, down into that hole. And then we take this and just rock it back and forth and it breaks off. So then I have the companion screw and I put a washer on it. The washers don't come in a little bag. This goes in here, I mean, you put your TV mount on of course and then this goes in. But this screws into the metal anchor in the back. I want to go in the center of this big hole. (drilling) Easy enough. Here's our toggle slot. That goes in, and we pull it out so it sets up against there. Pull that tight. Like that, and then perfect. (dog grunts) (dog barking) And our second one, just goes in, push it through, pull it back out, hold the toggle. You want to get this flush in there. So it makes that nice snapping noise, (snapping) like that. And then back and forth, it breaks off. (pounding) Good to go. Much easier if you have friends help you with this by the way. Screw with a washer that I added, and that goes in, and I just do this by hand. Or you could get your trusty screw gun. Maybe I'll get the screw gun. Hold on. (drilling) What do you know, it's level. What a wonderful thing. Okay, we've got our drywall anchors in but there's that stud, and it ends up that it's right here. It's a little close to my extension bracket here. But I'm going to drill a pilot hole and I'm going at a bit of an angle to get and grab (drilling) that stud. I'm going to be using some drywall screws with washers on them. You can use a heavier duty screw if you want. I found these to work quite well for what I do. By the way, this FlipBit thing is really handy. Just flips over, drywall screw on. (drilling) Nice. (drilling) Just like that. Alright. Upper body strength, ready? That aint going anywhere, TV is lighter than me. I wish I could be a little lighter. So something to think about here, is pay attention to where the cables come out of the back of your TV. If they come out this way you'll need more space on the back than if they come out pointing downward. And where the vents are, the cooling vents of your TV. If there are a lot of cooling vents on the back, you're going to need to add the spacers in. Check with your TV manual about that. But the spacers add some space so there heat can go out. This one is top and bottom, and the cables go out the bottom so we won't have a problem, we can have a narrow clearance here to the wall. There are usually four mounting holes in the back of a television, but what you have to be really careful about is connecting into the mounting hole but not going too far to where you would go into the electronics. That's a bad thing. Check the instructions to make sure which is the top and which is the bottom of these. Learn from me. Usually the set screw is at the bottom. Line these up and center them on your TV as best you can. Figure out which of these screws fits in here and use the shortest ones possible. Again, we don't want to go into the electronics in here, we just want to go into the mounting nut in the back. Okay? If it's a tight fit you can go without the washer. I'd rather use a shorter screw than a long one that could punch through it into the electronics here. Alright, this one flexes out so it's a little bit easier to put on, but these usually hook at the top and then you screw a connection into the bottom. Okay? Again, have somebody help with this is you can. Funny when it works isn't it? Alright, lets set the screws in the back. Good to go. (drilling) Nice. Alright, the set screws are done. Nice, huh? This particular mount is a articulated arm mount on a nice wall bracket. If you're interested in this one, I'll link in the show notes to a couple of them you can buy. It always helps to support Gardenfork when you're shopping online, we appreciate that. Hey everyone, I'm Eric Rochow. I host a show called Gardenfork.tv.

Vid27,Warm Floors! DIY Radiant Floor Heating - GardenFork,"- Hey, everyone, welcome to GardenFork. This is kind of a new one for us. We're doing a radiant heat floor system. We're at my friend Brian's house. I've been helping him renovate a three family house and we're down in the basement. They dug out the basement, they're pouring a new cement slab, we've got it all ready and now we're gonna do radiant heat in the concrete slab in the basement which is very, very cool. We put down gravel and then insulation and then a vapor barrier and the wire mesh for the cement and now we're ready to run this tubing. This is very DIY. This is the first time we've done this. We have a system that is built for DIY people. We're gonna see how it works out in Brian's house. - [Brian] It better work. - [Eric] Alright, here we go. This is called PEX, P-E-X, tubing. It's a new kind of tubing that they use in homes in place of copper pipe and we're gonna hook that up to a distribution manifold. So, this is a distribution manifold that comes with the kit we bought. - [Brian] There's three different loops, but it's one pump. - [Eric] One zone, it's a one zone - One zone because of the way it's set up over here, it's just, this is temporary, this thing. The water's gonna come in here and then out here. So, essentially, one pump going into here, but there's three different loops coming out. - [Eric] Right. (banging) - [Man] You don't do it with (mumbles). You have to do the rest of the floor though, don't you? - [Eric] Yep. - [Brian] Yeah, there's three of these runs, so we just took one. Now we have to do the other two. That's how this works. - When you're unrolling this hose, you just don't wanna pull it out of the box. You wanna uncoil it from the outside like this because that way you don't get any twists or weirdness in your hose, okay? Once you get this thing laid out, once you get out the first loop, the first circuit, it's like butter, it's pretty simple. Even I can do it, with Brian's help. We're running three sets of hoses or three loops we're calling them of the PEX pipe throughout this thing and it's gonna be on one zone. So, it's gonna be one circulator pump running all three circuits as you were. The idea of using three of them is if by the odd minimal chance that one of the loops gets a hole in it, the other two will still work. If you just ran one complete set of hose, if you would get a hole in it, then it's a bad thing. This way, if one of the circuits has a hole in it, the other two still work and they all go to the same circulator pump. This is a single zone system we're doing for one slab here, but it's working out really well. You need two or three people to do this, but if you follow the instructions that come with the DIY kit, it's pretty good. - [Brian] Yeah, they'll be some dust in here. Take three. - Take five, thank you, Brian. Alright, just give you an update here, we've laid down all the tubing, we have three circuits going into a manifold here. We laid down a second layer of cement reinforcement mesh on top of the tubing and now we're gonna hook up the tubing to the manifold, that's that thing there and do a pressure test. We're going to fill all the tubes with pressurized air from a compressor, we're gonna have a gauge on here, and we're gonna let it hold and see if it loses any air. If it loses air, we have a leak. If it doesn't, we're good. So, we're gonna cut these pipes, hoses, and connect them with compression fittings into the valves. Tight, but not too tight on that. That's a sync or two of compression fitting. - [Brian] You're so full of secrets, aren't ya? (machine whirs) - [Eric] Okay, compressor's charged. The regulator pressure we set at about 60 and we wanna charge up the manifold to the 50 PSI. Ready to go, Brian? - Let's see what happens. - [Eric] What's the stress level right now? - Right now, it's zero in the tubes and it's about 150% in my heart. - [Eric] So, we're gonna fill all the lines with compressed air and test for leaks. That's a lot of air we're gonna have to put in. - [Brian] Yeah. - [Eric] But it's going up, that one's going up. (machine whirs) Alright, we're at 50, now we wait. - Shh. - Alright, now we just wait. So, we're in Brooklyn, so you know what we do? We read the manual and then we drink coffee. - The directions say two hours. - Alright, cross your fingers. This is what I call the control system. Most of this was prebuilt and then we soldered in some connections and ran lines over the wall into the slab. Pretty easy to do. You should have some knowledge of soldering. Also a little knowledge about working with PEX tubing as well, but not something that I don't think that you can't do, but pretty cool. Circulating pump here. There's a thermostat control and we just followed the directions and it worked really quite well, so it's kind of fun. - [Brian] We bought a DIY, DYI kit that was to spec. - Right, so we basically contacted the supplier, told them what we wanted. They sent us this control, what do you call this? They sent us this rig, we put it on the wall, we soldered it all together, followed the instructions, and it works. So, the whole slab is heated by a dedicated water heater. You can't use the home water heater you have. You can't mix potable water with slab water. They do make some water heaters that have two separate systems, so it's one unit that has two different heating systems in it, but we didn't have that. (machines whirring) (knocking) - There's your finished product. So, after the concrete's cured, that's the word, we stained it with a kind of a neat, kind of, I don't know what kind of color that is, brownish color and then sealed that as well with a cement sealer and this place is amazingly warm when you turn on that radiant floor heating. You can be barefoot, the cement is warm and it really maintains a steady temperature really unlike like forced air turns on and then it's cold and it turns on. This is really the way to go. So, if you want more information about this, there'll be some links in the show notes here about some radiant floor stuff as well. And we put out eclectic DIY every week if you'd like to subscribe, hit the subscribe button. More information about me in the show notes as well. Give me your questions or comments. I'll try to help you with the answers, see ya. "
Vid28,Generator Tune Up and Oil Change - GardenFork,"(engine starts) - Hey, everyone, welcome to Garden Fork. That started on the first pull after sitting for quite a while because I do regular maintenance on the generator. Today I'm gonna show you my fall tuneup that I do. It's really simple. If I can do it you can do it, today on Garden Fork. Ready? Here we go. (engine shuts down) First thing you wanna do is heat this puppy up because we're gonna change the oil. So let it run for about ten minutes. You want the oil to become, what's the word, viscous? Move it around, you're gonna try and stir up the sediment at the bottom of the crank case. And generally warm this puppy up. Then take it in a dry place because it's raining out here, and we'll get to work, okay? I always like to try and elevate this thing before I try and work on it. It's a little bit easier on your knees that way. First thing we're gonna do is we're gonna drain out the oil, put in a new oil filter, and put in fresh oil. So we start with that by draining it. I had a little piece of pipe on here that makes it a lot easier to drain this oil. I've got a plastic milk carton. And a funnel to drain this out. This is gonna be hot, so, careful, okay? Maybe you should wear some gloves. If I had some. There we go. Clean that off. Clean off a little bit of that drip. I really like this little pipe I added on here. Take your used oil. See how dirty that is? It's been running your engine. To one of those instant car lube oil places or your local garage, and they will recycle this for you. I'm pretty sure it's almost in every state that's a law. Don't dump this in the yard. Don't dump it in a creek. Don't just throw it in your trash because this is bad stuff if it gets into the dirt. So we're gonna put new oil in here, but first make sure this funnel is clean. Because any dirt that's in the funnel is gonna go into the oil and then into your engine. And the whole idea here is to clean stuff outta your engine, not adding stuff into it. So use your ubiquitous, is that a word? Paper towel to clean this puppy out. All right. Oh, and check with your engine manufacturer about what weight of oil to put in here. It varies depending on who made the engine, but it should be in the little manual that came with it. Clean. It's like a magic trick. Take our cap off. Don't lose this. Put the is somewhere where you can find it again. It might roll away. Learn from me. Then a funnel and your oil. It's much cleaner oil going in there than it came out, isn't it? See how it's just coming out like that? That is the perfect height of your oil level. And because you put your cap in a special place you wouldn't forget, this goes back on easily. Don't force this. You can cross thread it easily. Just finger tight and then a little more. Now we're on the opposite side of the engine and we're gonna take out the oil filter, which is this black round thing here. I put some cardboard under here because it's gonna drip when we take this off. You can use the oil filter tool or... You can use some (mumbles) The idea here is not to crush the oil filter. Maybe one of your neighbors has the oil filter tool that'll fit in there, but we're gonna try with this. Okay, that's not gonna grab. Nope. All right. I thought this would work, and it won't. I'm gonna go see if my neighbor has an oil filter wrench that'll slip on here. There's a couple different kinds. There's the kind that's kinda like a cup that grabs on, and there's the kind that's kinda like a strap that straps on. So give me a couple minutes. If I don't come back and it's the next day, you'll know I had to go buy the tool. Ready? All right, it's the next day, as you can tell, and I have the proper tool now. I just went and bought one because no one had the right size one. But these are really handy to have if you have a lot of small engines like this. Okay. This is in a tight spot. But a lot of small engines are like this. I mean you gotta fit a giant generator on here as well. Some oil is gonna come outta here, so I put a little bit of cardboard underneath here to catch it. More than a little when you start talking as you're taking that off. So just keep that and point it up like that. And then pour this into the same little container that you had your waste oil in. And clean up all the stuff that... Is now falling down there. Make sure this is nice and clean. So take a thin film of oil and spread it on the seal of your new oil filter. Then hand tighten this puppy, okay? Then put our wrench back on here the opposite way. And I go hand height and then half a turn. It depends on the instructions here. I'm trying to get that in there. Very tight. All right, we've got the oil changed, we've changed our oil filter, we tightened it down. Now we're gonna change out the spark plug. I pre-order a spark plug, and then I make sure I have the right spark plug socket, because there's about three different size sockets for spark plugs. Make sure you have the right one, or maybe your neighbor does. These little sets are pretty inexpensive. I'll link in the show notes to one you might wanna buy. In here with the disconnected spark plug wire and then remove the spark plug, pretty simple. I'm gonna lift this up with the screwdriver. There we go, came right out. That is out. Here's the tip of our spark plug. Put our socket in here. Get that to engage. This is a difficult place but your fingers can get in here. It takes a minute to get this puppy outta here. There we go. Wow, that is in need of replacing. Here's our old spark plug, here's our new one. Be sure the gap, there's a spark plug gap here, is the same on the old one as on the new one. The gap is between the electrode and the contact here. Okay. And then this goes in. Remember, righty tighty. In other words clockwise to tighten. And then right and then just like an eighth of a turn... Like that. You don't want this too tight or else you can snap the threads. It's a bad thing. Now, learn from Eric, put the spark plug wire back on before you try and start this thing. Okay, learn from me. More than once I had forgotten to reconnect the spark plug wire. And then I'm like... Or I forgot to turn the On switch on, and I'm like... Anyway, it's just stuff like that happens, but that is pretty much toast. I do this every fall. And again, recycle this oil. Don't just dump it somewhere. Take it down to the gas station or your Quickie Jiffy oil change and lube place. Now it's time for the air filter. Easy peasy, goes in. But this actually makes a big difference, and you'd be surprised how dirty these things get. Especially with lawnmowers. By the way, we have a lawnmower tuneup video. The link will be at the end of the show or in that eye in the sky thing here. And also in the show notes here. I'll also link to all parts I think you should buy. There will be a list in the show notes here. Here's some signs of mice. They come in through the air intake hole and try to make a little house here. That's a bad thing. Maybe I can put some mesh over that. There we go. We have these little grabbers for the foam on the inner cover here. Hey, really important note here I didn't do in the shooting of this. You should always be using treated gas in your small engines. That's the reason my generator starts on the first pull. I have five-gallon gas cans. Whenever I fill one up at the gas station I use a gas stabilizer product. There's a number of them out there. Pick which one you like. But it's amazing how that will just help your engine run and run and not have problems. All right, we've changed our oil. We changed our oil filter, changed our spark plug, made sure it was gapped properly, put the spark plug wire back on. And we changed the air filter. Now we're gonna fire this puppy up and run it for a couple minutes, checking for leaks. And then we're gonna top up the oil because some of the oil is gonna go into the filter and stay there and our oil level will drop in the engine, which is gonna top it off. And we're done. And then we just, peace of mind for winter. Sit your choke, give it a pull. (engine starts) (engine purring) Definitely that oil should be level right here, and it's down a little bit, so we're gonna top that off. Nice, didn't take that long. Just remember, recycle your oil, breathe, not too hard. Biggest thing is finding the correct parts because the engines get the engine number and the model number of your generator. I'll link below to some places I like to buy that kinda thing from. And you're good to go. So if you got any thoughts or questions or comments about generators or the world in general, ask me below. I also talk about transfer switches, we made a video about that. Wow, that was an acorn. We put a manual transfer switch in the house and I answer questions about that as well. The links to that are at the end of the video here somewhere, or in the show notes below. So make it a great day. See you later. (chill music) "
Vid29,DIY External Hard Drive Replacement - GardenFork  - Updated Video,today in garden fork external hard drive replacement stay tuned hey everyone welcome to DIY garden for today we're doing electronic computer repair in the kitchen uh yeah it's the cleanest place I have so that's what we're gonna do yeah I'm going to show you today how to replace the hard drive in an external drive that you may have so if you have a dr that's failed or as beginning to fail you can replace the drive inside here and have a new hard drive how do you know it's about to fail i know this one is failing because it flakes out when i'm trying to write files to it and it just acts weird acting weird doesn't always mean you should replace it my point here is that hard drive enclosures like this one are made really well and if the drive inside is failing you can just replace the drive now the question here is what kind of drive to replace it with you want what's called a bare drive well it's a drive that would usually be put it's called an internal hard drive this is a bare drive so you will want to buy a bare drive and most of these bigger external drives are a three and a half inch SATA drive you can tell that by looking here there's an e SATA connection here so you basically want to get the same Drive sometimes you can get a larger drive and fit it in here as well that's what were going to do today this is a one terabyte I'm gonna put a four terabyte in it would be nice a couple things remember you wanna do this on a clean surface you want to discharge any static electricity you may have in your body you literally touch the sink the sink is usually grounded to the electrical system to the ground so you're discharging any static charge would have and then you can work on this a making hit up don't rub your feet on carpet while you're doing this there you go if you notice on the back of the drive are some screws and we're going to take these screws off and then you're going to take this a little stick or covering this screw that's their way of telling if you've messed with the box and your voiding your warranty but this thing is three years old anyway so it's past its warranty so these are Philip nah not all of them have really long screws like that usually these are very tiny screws this is kind of an annealed unusual design alright so now the front of this is going to come off oh yeah like that if i take the bottom off there are two screws here okay my point was showing people this is most people will throw the whole hard drive and the enclosure out because oh it's broke it's not good anymore and what I want to tell people's you're doing a little DIY electronics you can reuse the enclosure and save money because you just buying a bare drive like this is much less expensive than a whole new hard drive with an enclosure so if your drive is failing or failed you can just buy a new hard drive and use the enclosure this is a really nice enclosure why do they fail hard drives are very much like a record player there are these discs their magnetic disks and they have a arm that goes across them and after spinning for a thousands and thousands of times they eventually wear out okay I've removed it two screws on the bottom oh and this literally falls out like that so what I'm going to do is this is the drive we're going to remove from its chassis there are two screws here and that's holding the drive onto the chassis so we'll just remove that and then these screws here be very careful around this circuit board you don't want to scrape it or drop anything on it or break it and then this pulls out like that that's easy so this is our broken drive and this is our good chassis and we're going to put a new drive on here if the drive is still functioning you can copy the media or files that are on the drive onto your new bare drive by using what's called a dock these are pretty cool they literally allow you to take bear drives and this is now a hard drive and you can use a cable to connect this to your computer and your drive copy the old data over to your new drive put this drive in the enclosure so you can use the duck right at once you have the stock is really great there's a link below to buy these dogs I look in a lot you obviously have one they're great they're great for doing backups okay here's our new drive so I'm going to take the drive and slide it in easy peasy and it just mates up and then we make sure that the holes are lined up back here so these four screws hold your hard drive onto the chassis with all electronics that run the hard drive all right brand new drive on the chassis we're ready to put it back in here you can do this it's just be sure you grounded be sure you grounded you've discharged up electricity to a ground you're well grounded based on a drug use me a well grounded no but i am going to slide this in pay attention there are some screw holes here and there are some screw holes here okay looks easy to flip it's easy to put this in upside down so this hold on I just have to nudge it in here oh oh that sounds big quick yeah nice so these screws go in so we're just putting Humpty Dumpty back together again yep exactly very good fit the sign here this has to line up this little button has to line up at the button there alright can't do that just like that okay okay oops I go do that really didn't take very long but you know you do know disarm take pictures as you go along good idea as you take it apart take pictures there are a couple little things to remember but you can do this I just did to solve with a couple of little screwdrivers I mean we all you should have a little collection of little smaller screw drivers will link to a screwdriver kit in the show notes here but this is kind of neat because this enclosure this is a good company that makes this enclosure and it's out of warranty they're not going to replace the drive and the box is still good the electrons are so good it's just the hard drive itself there's a lot of electrical mechanical activity in here it wears out this box and its electronics by still very good there you go we've replaced the drive in our drive enclosure you save yourself some money I'm good to go these are kind of cool give me your kids taking these apart as a lot of fun um sorry Labradors pain will not take this apart it's not as much fun for them but it's kind of a neat electronics aha to let your kids take the stuff apart they can learn about electronics maybe it'll spark their interest in a career you know so they're going more DIY videos on our site also on our youtube channel you want to subscribe hit the button right there you can also get our email newsletter comes out every week there's a link for that here hopefully as well and down on the show notes and again links to buy the drives and some tools i suggest are here in the show notes as well all right so what do cool stuff if you have some comments or thoughts about this i'll comment yeah are we gonna get to see your tape Dewey Decimal System food blue tape is very high-tech all right there you go any questions comments leave them below always like to hear from people ok so make it a great day i'll see you all right if i give you these you're going to be quiet so I can finish the show right 
Vid30,Homemade Greenhouse Tour - DIY Project - GardenFork,"- Hey everyone, welcome to Garden Fork. Today I'm gonna give you a tour of my homemade greenhouse behind us here. We've had this house well the greenhouse was here when we moved in. I did some upgrades but I just wanted to show you, if you got a bunch of windows laying around, you could make something like this, right? - [Woman] Right! - Okay. - [Woman] (laughs) I was preoccupied by that. (dogs talking) - Alright, let me give you a tour, okay? These are these giant windows that were in the garage actually when we bought the house. You might find these at a junkyard or something or maybe someone's throwing them out. And then the roof is actually fairly new. It is a corrugated greenhouse plastic that we bought at one of the home improvement stores. So, that's the new thing. It did have this kind of old style -- - [Woman] Green, it was green. - It was like a faded green roof but a couple of tree limbs went through it and some ice and so we upgraded and got something that's a little more robust. - [Woman] Oh, I think this is where you say, we have a video about that. - It's a lot of snow. - [Woman] You barely put a dent in it. - Yeah, well that's all I can reach but it'll take some of the weight off. - [Woman] You wanna tell them about the-- (woman screaming loudly) (woman and man laughing) - Wow. - [Woman] It worked! (woman laughing) - See it's very simple. There is a bit of a snow load on here so I've upgraded the bracing of our roof here. So where the greenhouse meets the clapboard of the house, I put in a big piece of flashing at an angle so water doesn't get between the greenhouse and the clapboard and rot that wood. It hits the metal flashing and then goes onto the roofing of the greenhouse there so, however your house is clad, think about that if you're attaching your greenhouse to the wall of the house. I tried to build a new door and it didn't work very well. So this is a-- - [Woman] A hazard - A hazard, so we will make a new door. I'm not a finish carpenter. - [Woman] Wait, where's that glass? - Oh this is where the glass hit the stone wall and broke. (woman chuckles) - [Woman] There's stone behind that glass. - Yup, oops. (dog panting) So this, I feel like I consider this a three season greenhouse. Winter is just too cold. Maybe it's a two and a half season cause the middle of the summer gets quite hot in here. It'll get up to 100 degrees. If you put some shade cloth over the greenhouse roof, I think in the middle of the summer, it'll be more useful but by that time, you got your seeds, your seedlings and everything are already outside. But it's just kinda a neat place to get some kind of warmth in late winter or in the fall. It just kinda, get the sun coming in, it's quite nice. But it's all totally DIY. This is scrap lumber, this big window here was a window that I found in one of the sheds. I used to have one of these solar-powered, well it's kind of a heat-activated opener and closer-- - [Woman] Oh yeah, I remember that. - And I bought this at a greenhouse supply, I'll link it to the show notes if you want to use it but I just found that it was easier just to prop it open with a stick. - [Woman] That's not your style anyway. - Well because until the end of September, it gets too hot in here so I just keep the windows open night and day. It is fun to watch this thing open and close but if your window's too heavy or if there's a snow load on top of your window, this all becomes an issue. So this pretty simple. This is my manual vent opener. Here. - [Woman] Ta-da! - And that stays like that for the three seasons. I also have another window over here. This one, again, I found it and I just thought because it's a little higher up, the heat would go out. It works pretty good and I keep the door open most of the time too. You could put a vent way in the top here but that becomes more difficult cause then you have to cut into the plastic clear roofing. [Woman] Then you'll have a hole in your roof. - And you have a hole in your roof. (woman laughing) - The potting table is just some scrap lumber that we put together, it's really great for projects. We shot a bunch of videos here, our cleaning cast iron with a battery charger video which we just shot the links up in the show notes for that. So it's also nice to have a work table with a solar light, just a nice enveloping light. And then we just kinda put bird houses and stuff here. One warning about bird houses, mice will try and move into them. - [Woman] They won't try they'll succeed. - They will succeed. That's our biggest problem in the greenhouse is the critters that will get in. It was either a possum or raccoon got in here and blew out a window of my, big vent window there. If you're gonna have any, if you're keeping any buckets, keep the buckets upside down, otherwise mice will go in here and they'll get stuck and die and then it smells really bad. Anything you keep underneath here, just keep in mind that the mice will try and get into it. The floor is plastic with just some pea gravel on top of it. It's a clear four or six mil plastic I laid down and then the pea gravel. And that's great because it just keeps some of the ground moisture from wicking up into the air. - [Woman] It keeps the weeds out. We used to have a bunch of weeds in here. - Right, so it'll also keeps the weeds down cause it's so nice in here that a lot of stuff will grow. Greenhouse. One upgrade that I'm gonna do is I was gonna put electricity out here and so you should use a GFI outlet with a weather protective cover. This is really important because even in here, it can get wet and if your outlet gets zapped, it's a bad thing. You can arc, it can start a fire. These are nominally expensive but are worth the money. I'll link to the one that I'm using in the show notes below. But you can do this. You can put an outlet, put the cover on, with the weather protective cover, makes me (mumbles). - [Woman] I see you also have some natural history exhibits going on here. - Yeah you know, this is like a skull we found in the woods. It just kinda fun to decorate it with found stuff. - [Woman] There's part of the power system right there. - That's actually the old generator wire and I just haven't taken it out yet. - [Woman] Oh, so it's nothing. - Right. - [Woman] It's decorative. - So this roof gets quite a load of snow. So I put in a two by four and this cross-bracing so the load is shared by these and I know these studs should be turned on their end but this was how it was when I got here and I wasn't about to change it. But then I put in this cross-beam which I've tied into the walls so it helps with the snow load but I do have to, every winter, I have to pull the snow off this roof. But sometimes it's just kinda fun to watch it all shoosh right off the roof. So it's like, whooomp. - [Woman] And it melts pretty quickly actually. - Yeah it melts pretty quickly but also then you've got this little solarium in the winter, you can come in here and hang out, have your coffee. - [Woman] Awwww. (dog panting) - Take that, go outside. No. Get it and go outside. Alright, there you go. Another one of our eclectic DIY videos. We have a bunch of gardening videos and you know, just Eric doing stuff on the weekends. If you like what you're seeing here, you can subscribe. Information about me is below, more of our-- (dog barking) videos. And more of the labradors. So tell me what you think in the comments below. Have you made a greenhouse? I'd like to hear about it.

Vid31,Use A Ladder On The Stairs- Ladder Stairwell Hack - GardenFork,"- Hey everyone, welcome to DIY Gardenfork. I'm Eric Rodshaw. We're here in a hallway. It's actually the top of my house, my hallway. I wanna show you how I get up into the top of this hallway to do painting or repairs. Ready? Here we go. So, first off, I use one of these adjustable extension ladders. They come in various brand names, but you can move these up and down, they're adjustable, they bend all sorts of ways. We're gonna just use it as a straight extension ladder. You could also just use an extension ladder as well. They work just fine. So if we wanna get up into the top of the hallway you would think oh I'll just put the ladder, I don't wanna poke a hole in the ceiling, like this right? Heres the problem with that. The problem is this, if you put down the ladder on the stairs crossways one leg sits on the stair, this other leg has nothing to hold onto. So I've got a solution for that. First measure across how far out this leg sticks out into the air here, and then add an inch or two. And then measure how far down it is to the step from that leg as well and write down those two numbers. So take that width measurement and cut it out of a nice piece of wood. I used common pine here. Nice and wide. Sturdy. So this is the width again, from the one step of the ladder to the other step of the ladder here. Then that rise or that height measurement, right here. I cut another piece of wood so we have our rise and our width, and I secured it with a two by three here. Out of some scrap plywood, I made some triangles. (sound of drill) to give some added strength (sound of drill) to our step. (sound of drill) So then figure out where you want to place your ladder and place your step right there. By the way the usual safety rules apply be very careful with ladders, always have somebody helping you. This is a use this information at your own risk. This works for me. Be careful. Okay. Place your ladder, find your step, make sure its secure. (music) (climbing the ladder) Now I can get the masking tape that I forgot to take down before when I had the ladder up earlier. (tape being pulled) alright, there you go thanks for watching. If its your first time here, you wanna subscribe, hit the subscribe button, up there or down here. Let me know what you all think, down below here. Comments and questions, I always like to hear from people then go out and do cool stuff. See ya. (wind blowing) (dogs barking) Bring it here!

Vid32,Fix Window and Door Screens Yourself - GardenFork,"- Hey everyone, today on Garden Fork, how to replace a screening on a window or door. I didn't do this. (relaxing guitar music) (barking) Usually in the summer, this becomes screen door, but somebody blew through it last year. Who broke through the screen door? Could that be you Charlie pup? (barking) So I'm gonna show you today how to fix your screen door cause instead of having to buy a new screen or maybe even a whole new door, you just fix it, like I do, ready? Here we go. Here's what you're gonna need: some screening spline, a spline tool, a really sharp brand-new blade utility knife and some screen material. Ideally, you want a big flat workspace as big as whatever screen you're replacing. Use your knife and dig out a piece of the existing spline here and you just pull this out. And take that to the store and match it to the spline they have, there's a couple different... There we go, be better if it looks like that. There's a couple different diameters of spline, it's like rubbery string. Well, it's rubber that's string-like; rope-like, maybe that's the right word here. Anyway go to the store and get that, get your spline tool and again sharp utility knife. And then start taking this out. That comes out and then this comes out very easily. Unroll your screen, can be a little tricky. Make sure you have enough. Trim this so there's some overlap past here. These are called bulldog clamps, I mean use what you got. I make sure the screen is overlapped the corner and then I take this and I snap that on like that. So this is the opposite corner that we just clamped so pull this tight like that and take another clamp slip that on like that. So I got four corners now, with the little clamps. Now we're gonna use our spline tool. Now on the spline tool there are two ends; two wheels. One of them is rounded like this and the other one has a groove in it like that. We're gonna first use the round end and we're gonna push the screen into the trough or the gap then we're gonna lay the spline in and use the one with the ridge and push it in. Here we go. I'm gonna start in the shorter end of the screen here and press this in. So now I've got my spline material I'm gonna use the side of the roller tool with the indent in it and this is gonna... If you just lay this in here. You get it started; really helps to have two people do this but you hold this out and roll this in. As you're doing this, can think about ways to prevent your Labrador from ruining the screen again and I have an idea about how to prevent that. Round roller on the long side. Then the indented roller with our spline again. Something we didn't talk about before was screen selection. This is a aluminum screening that's been painted black it also comes in silver and maybe gray. You can also get screen made out of fiberglass which is... It kinda feels like plastic and then they also make a super duty screen which is kinda dog-proof I haven't used that yet. I have a different solution for keeping my Labradors from punching through this screen you'll see at the end of the show. Alright, but you can pick different screen, I got the black because it's a black frame and people in my house... Certain person in my house, likes colors to match. What that's all about, I don't know. Do you wanna talk to me about that screen door? Do you wanna confess to the screen door damage or just go chase squirrels? Go get the squirrel. So after you've got your screen all laid in, take a very sharp utility knife and you run it on the outside edge, just past the spline and that will separate like that. And to keep the Labradors from blowing out my next repaired screen, a little Lucite. Sharp blade. Ah, darn it. Let's see if this works. (snap) Beautiful. (whirring) And to keep my little friends from blowing out the screen, a piece of Lucite. These are self-tapping zip screws. Drill a pilot hole in the plastic first. And it cracks. Drill the proper diameter pilot hole so the screw goes through and doesn't crack. Learn from me. (whirring) What's out there? (barking) (whistling music) Alright there you go, how to repair a screen. I put out DIY videos every week if you want to hit the subscribe button, also check out the little round eye-in-the-sky dot for other DIY and Labrador videos. So let me know what you think, what would you differently, do you throw the ball? Make it a great day, see you later. (barking) - [Eric] Go get the ball. "
Vid33,Pressure Treated Wood For Raised Garden Beds? - GardenFork,"- Hey, everyone, welcome to Garden Fork. Today, should you use pressure-treated lumber in your garden, specifically raised vegetable beds. I'm gonna answer that today in Garden Fork, all right? First, we gotta throw the ball. As far as we can. I've built raised beds with pressure-treated lumber, and without. The regular southern pine ones, I coated with linseed oil, and they lasted about 10 years. You can see here, of what the inside of the bed looked like as I took that one apart. But there is a new kind of pressure-treated lumber out there, that is copper-infused, rather than arsenic-infused. And reading online, with some people that actually know what they're talking about, I think it's actually okay to use this new copper-infused, pressure-treated lumber in your vegetable beds. A 2007 study of the safety of ACQ published in Human and Ecological Risk Assessment concluded that exposure to copper from contact with ACQ-treated wood is not expected to have adverse effects on the health of adults or children. This is the new copper-infused kind, it'll have a label on the side here telling you about it. I don't think there's any of the older, arsenic-based stuff for sale anymore, to tell you the truth. First I wanna say that I am not a scientist, I'm just your average gardener guy. - [Woman] You look like a scientist. - I am not a scientist. (chuckles) (woman laughs) But I am a realist, all right? So here's a couple of points that I, doing some research, found out. The copper in the new copper-infused treated woods, deters insects. And copper is actually used as a fungicide in vegetable gardening... As it is? Is that the right word? Anyway, we use now copper as a fungicide for vegetable gardening. So copper in the wood, I think is okay. And if a plant absorbs too much copper, it'll die. So you're not gonna eat it anyway, because it's dead. - [Woman] It'll regulate it for you. - There you go. The fungicides used, there's two different brands of this copper-treated wood. They use two different fungicides. One of them is used in swimming pool chemicals, and the other one is already used to treat funguses, on agricultural farms. So I think that's okay, too. - [Woman] Well, hopefully you're not drinking your swimming pool water, though. - You inhale some, you swallow some swimming pool water. When you swim. - [Woman] Speak for yourself. - Yeah.(chuckles) Another point is, is yes there is copper in this wood, but there's also copper in the drinking water in your home. Older homes have copper pipes, and they have for years. And from what I've read, one person suggested that you'll absorb more copper from your drinking water than you would from a copper pressure-treated piece of garden lumber. Interesting, huh? (dog barks) - [Woman] Is that a copper-infused tennis ball? - No, these get run over by the lawn mower. If you're still concerned about using pressure-treated lumber, you can line the inside, the part that's gonna be touching the soil, with plastic. I just took some plastic, I stapled this on, and then I have the preservation qualities of the treated wood and I'm also keeping the treatment from touching my garden soil. It does go to say, if you're being completely organic, you can't have the pressure-treated wood touching your soil, and you would line it, like this. - [Woman] Wait, but plastic is okay? - Yeah. - [Woman] All right cause that's... just strikes me as odd, but okay. - That's, that's their rules not mine (woman laughs) so I'm just saying, if it's, if it's a little concern for you, line the insides with plastic. Works well. So this is one of the beds that I built ten years ago and I coated just regular, southern pine, or common pine, with linseed oil I let it dry overnight, and then I built the beds. And they've lasted, I mean, this is the outside, and the top it's lasted quite a while, and this was in the inside. And the bottom, it's pretty crumbly. But, ten years? That's pretty good. - [Woman] Is that why you're taking them apart? Or are you taking them apart for another reason? - I'm taking them apart because they're falling apart. - [Woman] Okay. - Actually, the brackets and stuff are intact. It's the wood, won't hold the screws anymore. (imitates air whooshing) So there you go. There are your choices. Copper pressure-treated wood in your vegetable garden, if that concerns you, line it with plastic. Or, take a regular piece of pine, and coat it with linseed oil. It'll look like this after a couple years. But there's a couple choices there. We have a bunch of videos about seed starting, and building raised beds, and gardening in general, the show notes below. My show here, is Eclectic DIY. It's cooking, gardening, home improvement, Every week, we do something different, and we put a video up about it. What are your thoughts about treated wood and gardening? I'd like to hear you below. - [Woman] Polite thoughts! (laughs) - Polite thoughts, or thoughts about your Labradors. Make it a great day.

Vid34,Replace Trigger Switch on a Sawzall type reciprocating saw - GardenFork,"- Hey everyone, welcome to Garden Fork. This is a video I made a while ago about fixing my reciprocating saw. I fixed the switch so I'm going to show you how to do that. What else do I talk about? - [Woman] Sander. - Sand. We also have a couple other power tool repair videos. I fixed my palm sander the other day and I also fixed a circular saw. It's this kinda thing where I hate is throwing things out so I wanna show you all, fix your tools and you'll have new tools and you saved a bunch of money and you learn something maybe. Ready? Here we go. (uplifting music) - [Woman] What you got there? - This is called a reciprocating saw and my trigger switch is broken. These are really, really great tools for cutting plumbing pipe or joist out of a roof or a ceiling. They're great for demoing stuff. What's really nice if you have to get it up into somewhere, the blades bend, so you can shove it up some where and it goes-- (imitates blade whirring) It cuts. - [Woman] It doesn't snap off. - They'll snap eventually, but I mean the blades are essentially disposable. Anyway the switch stopped working. So I went onto the Sears website and you can order parts there believe it or not. So I ordered a switch, it was really, really easy. - [Woman] Cheap? - Yeah I think the switch was three dollars. The shipping cost more than the switch did. You know a lot of times people's tools break and you can fix them. - [Woman] You can find them on the street. - Yeah. Generally... - [Woman] Is this plugged in? - No, no you have to make sure its unplugged. - [Woman] Good. - So we're gonna take these screws out. To get to our switch here. - [Woman] You can do that. - Well maybe. Sometimes these screws are really in there, so. So you take all the screws out. And sometimes it's not obvious. Sometimes the screws are hidden underneath labels. Like this label here. - [Woman] That metal label? - Well this is a plastic label on a case. And there might be a screw underneath here hiding, to get the case off. I don't think there is, in this case. When you pop this open you gotta be careful. 'Cause sometimes there are stuff in there that there's springs and stuff that might go flying. So try and find an obvious place to pop the case. Like right there. Oh, I forgot to take some more screws out. (dogs playing) Okay now, perfect world, this should pop out. - [Woman] How perfect is your world? - Well, my world's good. There you go, something went flying. (woman laughing) Gotta be careful. Well this is the switch here. - [Woman] That's what we're fixing? - That's what we're fixing. - [Woman] Okay. - And this is a throttle, a speed setting. Which doesn't need to be fixed. - [Woman] It would never occur to me to change the switch myself. - It's easy to do! - [Woman] What's going on with those wires? - Uh, I don't know, it's a little tricky. Well I can't really see how you get them out. - [Woman] Wee short-lived episode. - Take your jeweler's screwdrivers. - [Woman] Does everybody have those? - Yeah, everyone's got little screwdrivers. I think these might have what's called Stab-Loks. This is being held in here by a little spring tension. So you just press in here. - [Woman] With your jeweler or something? - With your jeweler screwdriver. Well I think that's what's happening. I think I'm gonna have to break down and put on my-- (yelling) (laughing) - [Woman] Help me to make fun of him. Now you can write in, now you got something to write about. - I'm looking at the new switch, trying to figure out how the old switch works. (squeak) - [Woman] Okay what happened? - I was trying to nicely get the wires out of here. - [Woman] And be rude. - Well, I just realized that the switch is broken anyways. So I thought there would be a little release to get these. These are held in, a little spring-loaded thing. But I can't get it to release, so, if all else fails... - [Woman] Bust it. - Break it open. - [Woman] You don't find that intimidating? - Nope, no. So now we can take the wires out. There you go, nicely. These other two wires are held in by a little screws here. I forgot to mark which wires go where. (laughs) I forgot to mark which wires go where in the switch. But thankfully we videotaped this so we can rewind the videotape. And take a look. But since you're not gonna videotape your tool repair, you should write down, make a little diagram. - [Woman] Maybe you should. - Which we're gonna do right now. Or you could have your better half videotape your escapades. And send them to us. Alright so we made a diagram. Which we should have done ahead of time. I don't know if you can read that, but I can. This is the new switch. We're gonna put the switch in. And then the red wire... Goes in like that. That goes in. Press that in. - [Woman] Easily. - Yeah. Yup. - [Woman] And you don't have to screw anything? - Well for the ones on this side you don't have to screw them, and the ones here you screw. I don't know why they did that. But, you know, I didn't build the thing. Alright, so these go in here. Screw that down. Put the switch back in. We gotta put the case back together and then we'll test it. Don't test this until you have it all put back together again. You don't wanna shock yourself, okay? You should pay attention to how the thing came apart so you can put it back together. Okay so I figured out how to get all the wires together. You have to just kind of take care to put them in the little channels. So now we're ready to put this thing back together again. So, in a perfect world... This all slips right together. And this seems to be doing that, scary as it sounds. So we go back to our container of screws. - [Woman] Thanks, cow! (squeak) (cheerful music) - Bill is here. - Yeah, howdy. - I'm gonna switch to the speed drill. Make this go faster. You just have to make sure they're tight. Not too tight cause you may have to take the thing back apart again. Knowing my luck. Okay. - [Woman] Okay! - Do a little Eric idiot check, make sure that you've got all the screws back in and that you don't have any more parts in here. Switch clicks at least so we're gonna plug it in and see what happens. - [Woman] Should we get out the fire extinguisher? - Yeah. We have a fire extinguisher in the basement. You should all have a fire extinguisher in the basement. - [Woman] Could we find it if we needed it? - I know where it is. - [Woman] Where? - Okay, ready? (laughing) Gotta put on some safety equipment. - [Woman] Mr. Magoo glasses. (whirring) - [Bill] Yay! - [Woman] Wow! - Yay! - [Bill] What was wrong with it? - The switch was broken. - [Woman] I wouldn't do that. - Now it works. (whirring) So there you go. If you wanna see our palm sander repair or other DIY videos, the links are in the show notes here. Questions or comments, love to hear from them. We put out videos every week. If you like eclectic DIY, and my two best friends here... Subscribe, and I'll see you later! Make it a great day. - [Woman] Three best friends. - Oh that's right. Am I in trouble now? - [Woman] No. - Well good. (laughing) (tropical music) "

Vid36,How to Unclog a Drain - GardenFork,every one today we're in the basement I came down here before and the washing machine was running and there was water all over the floor I was like okay what has happened now because we always are having water leaks in the basement which we'll talk about in future shows but I realized that the overflow not the overflow pipe but the the drain pipe for the washing machine was just dumping water as you see here and we have to figure out what's wrong so my first thing is I'm thinking that one of the traps are clogged or there's a clog in the main line so we use a thing called a sewer snake or a drain snake or a snake drain drain snake to get that out so I just want to show you a little bit about if you have a clogged drain how to fix it all right those clogs in your drain system happen at what's called the trap the trap is a little little loop at the bottom of the sink and if you've ever looked underneath the sink and you see that the pipe come down and go like this and then out called a p-trap that trap is there it's called a trap because what it does is it traps any gases that might be coming from the sewer line it keeps them from going up into your sink and then making the house smell not nice um so but when that Bend is there hair can collect in there so for grease you know marbles weird stuff can get stuck in the trap to clean out a trap you can if you're in a sink or a toilet you can use a plunger which is you know fairly effective but if we're at the washing machine here or something like that you need a snake and if your plunger doesn't work also you have to move to a snake a snake is basically a wire like this this is a snake it has kind of a spiny end on it here and it is long and as flexible this particular one is really cool because it rotate so you can rotate this and this goes out and this cleans out the drain the pipe in other words and it has a little hook on the end and it will grab hopefully what's on the dogs barking with this up with the little hook end down here what the snake can do is you can grab the clog and pull it back out through and you can throw it out or you can just run this through and it's like grease and soap and stuff you can run this through it'll blow a hole through there and the water will go through and you run hot water down there and you'll clean it out and it goes in the septic or the sewer system what I like about this one in particular is that a lot of these will have a handle on the end so you can crank it this one has a spud on the end here that you can hook up your power drill to so this goes to this and then you run this down the drain and it works really well so watch watch me do this and see what happens you're going to help you're going to help me clean the drain we have our snake and we have our electric drill make sure you're not standing in water when you do this or use a cordless drill cordless drills work even better sometimes but my batteries are dead so the cool one about this is that you pull this little trigger here and it feeds it out and then when you put the drill in reverse and you both will trigger it'll pull the snake back in which is very nice we watch so we're going to pull the trigger see how it goes out and then we're going to reverse the drill it pulls it back in again which is very cool all right here we go I kind of felt something there so now I'm going to pull it back I'm going to put it reverse or you can just pull it out as well no it doesn't feel like it throw got a mind of its own sometimes in a careful you can also hand feed this back in so I think I kind of got stuck on something there so I just put this some reversing we're going to pull this out ooh nice okay that's your typical clog that's a bunch of hair so you know when you're when you wash your hair sometimes it gets stuck in the drain well that shampoo and soap and everything so there you go I think we fixed that that's how you unclog a drain remember there's a trap underneath each drain use your snake tri up plunger first try running really hot water down the drain sometimes that'll loosen things up or get out your trusty snake these things are getting expensive this this was I think about $35 at the store I like it because you can put the drill on it you can put your cordless drill in this as well go to town it makes a mess so watch out you're going to get black gook all over the place all right come to the greenhouse and tell us some of your drain stories it might be kind of fun to see how other people do it because you know I'm not the master of everything I'm just the master the obvious here um that's it thanks for watching and have a great day I'll see you later 
Vid37,How to Repair Cracks and Leaks in Basement Walls and Floors -  GardenFork,oh that's nice oh hey everyone we are yet again in Tracy's basement because I've come to visit and as well as a project of course and you remember Sam my sister has a big water leak in her basement there's a big crack that goes through the whole floor and we've been trying to figure out how to deal with there's a number of methods and I told her if she chipped out the crack I show her how to use hydraulic cement um to fix it so here we are she has chipped out the crack which is the really pain part of this thing and uh you can see here this is a very good job you want that all clean if you see anything loose in here you should just pull it out like these little pieces here just Fleck them out that's okay and like there you know just got that just pull that out it sounds like you're cleaning somebody's teeth yes but the more loose material you get out the better this is called hydraulic cement now most cements when you pour them out they contract a little bit in hydraulic cement expands hydraulic cement works very well you have to use it in small batches so we're going to show you how to do that okay by the way this is a wood chisel you don't use that for concrete okay i lurk this is a really good chisel for cleaning out stuff because it has a protector so when you're hitting with a hammer you don't hit your hand you know your if you miss you get the plastic instead of hitting your hand you know when you're going to be chiseling use the safety glasses because concrete will chip up and hit you in the eye that's a bad thing get out the loose stuff we've got wire brushes you can clean out the crack with that you know just be creative you could use a screwdriver as well but you know screwdrivers your screwdriver but safety first you have to wear gloves when working with this stuff do not use cement without wearing gloves on I'm going to use these fancy blue gloves the nitrile gloves they're called but they work really well or a heavy rubber glove don't use the latex ones um cements have I think they had lie in them and that hurts your hands so if you like a doctor here are young Jackie Sam this one hurt a good Sam here we go you want if you have to store this stuff you want to keep it in a dry place you don't want cement to get moist or humid because it will turn into a big road am I not doing this right you're supposed to pop there's a crack to pop right over here on my side see okay how much for reading instructions on Apollo spells redirections but this is Gardevoir okay inside this looks like just great dirt so we take some of this again not a lot that's about hmm what's that two cups worth cup and a half so how much of the crack will that go not much so we're gonna do little pieces in this stuff sets up really fast you'd be logical to start at the wall and work into the room no well what's wrong we'll start right here I'm very linear he's starting and ending but you can start in the middle it's better for the video right here okay it looks like somebody put something else in this crack before - oh yeah that's the problem is you're always repairing someone else's mess so you want this to be like a little wetter than play-doh all right wallpaper face and if you if it's too soupy see right now it's too soupy I put in too much water you add a little bit more of the dry powder is it about the consistency of banana bread oh yeah there you go like cookie dough okay you know is dry okay well this is banana bread dough then all right so this is ready to be put in here oh wow let's go okay this is going to be fairly messy it's not a super clean repair um if you take this and you press it in and you have to work quickly because this stuff sets up very quickly cool so you're pushing it deep into the crack right deep crack in some places alright see this is already setting up Wow are you gonna make it on eat and tiny on the top no but my forehead choppin it right I'll show you I'll show you okay let's see if this is hard this is already getting hard in here yeah now so that's a cookie dough gets past cookie dough well past beneath oh okay that's alright Sam looks impressed um the thing is now we have to clean this bucket out and start over again so we're just going to dump this in the trash clean out this bucket and start over it's best if you have a very flexible container or if you have a basketball like a cheap and rubber basketball or a rubber ball cut it in half and you've got a very flexible Bowl you know you can just invert it just go and you pop it out then all the concrete pops out and you can start over again of course I forgot something it's best to wet the joint before you apply the cement because cement absorbs water it's hydrophilic I believe the word is but when cement cures its absorbs water does that like when you wet pastry and pie crust to make the pie crust stick to each other better yes it's the same principle I think I understand it better with my crust than I do cement if somebody really like to know proportions of water to cement isn't like two to one or they have to read the instructions and they probably would watch garden for drive times now there are people that read instructions and then they watch garden fork and they tell me what I did wrong so you know I'm not I'm not a cement expert I'm sure there are some experts watching who will tell us but of course you know you can come on the green house green - house TV and tell us what you think um you know that's the whole idea that that site is for people to kind of give feedback to each other but you know I love it I'll really like the people are there it's kind of neat to see what other people are up to you know Tracy's there she posts recipes and stuff and the mirror and the bathroom is still hanging yes yes I Marion going anywhere all right so there you go the crack is done ideally when you're repairing a crack you're going to chisel it so it's like a keyhole slot in there but that's not always possible with these kind of things it's really hard to do especially in a crime like this if you can also work this stuff in your hands as well you know when it's ready because it gets really warm all the sudden and you shove it into the crack um that's really handy especially when you also have a gushing leak and there's rain coming in or something you know around the pipe or something you can mix it up and you shove it in and you hold it there and then it expands out was that exciting Sam he said you better be with safety gloves over here I'm sorry all right so thanks for Tracy offer on the camera and come to the green house green - house TV and tell me what you think all right I'll see you later now I have to clean up right Sam come on Sam let's process oh well let's mr. safety tripping over the door 
Vid38,How To Sharpen Lawn Mower Blades Best Way - GardenFork,"- Today on GardenFork, sharpening lawnmower blades. You'd be surprised how dull these blades get, and if you haven't sharpened them in a while, it's time to do it. I do it actually a couple times a year. The Labradors love the lawnmower because I throw the ball while I mow the lawn. Right? Sharpening your blades. If I can do it, you can do it. Ready? Here we go. First thing you wanna do, get some food plastic wrap from your kitchen. Gas cap off. Plastic wrap on. And screw that down. So make sure this is sealed really well. If that could screw back on, that would help. Okay. So take a look at your mower. Whatever side of the mower has the gas cap on it, that side is gonna be tilted up so we can get to the mower blade. We do that so if there's any gas, it doesn't spill out the cap. So just like this. It gets tilted like that. Alright, inside this mower is a little dirtier than I usually like. I'm the one that professes you should always be cleaning the underside of your mower. But anyway, I'm gonna show you how to take off the blade. Okay? Get yourself a piece of scrap wood and a clamp. We're gonna put this down here to keep the blade from moving when we undo the bolt, unscrew the bolt. So this goes in here like this. Righty tighty. Remember that. Put your wrench on this bolt. Don't use an adjustable wrench. Use the wrench that's the right size. Pull this up. And there you go. If I throw this, will you leave me alone? Blade is off. It's in okay shape, but definitely needs sharpening. So we're gonna go in the shop, do this up. This is really brilliantly simple, and the sharper your blade, the healthier your grass because it cuts it clean rather than wackin' it with a dull piece of metal. Here we go. The ball's coming back. Run. (dog barking) So the easiest way I found to sharpen mower blades is with a right-angle grinder that has a grinding wheel attachment. These are relatively inexpensive these days. They're very handy to have if you have any DIY projects. You can also get a specific grinding wheel that connects onto your drill bit. Best with a corded drill, and you can run along. I like this. Either one, you have to have safety equipment, okay? You need eye protection. And you need ear protection. Because you wanna save these and these so you can mow your lawn. This needs a little cleaning, I know. So we wanna maintain the same angle that is on here, and just make it sharper. This is my favorite part, sparks. Done. Well, almost done. Balancing is important. When this thing is underneath the engine, it is whipping around. Well, it's all going one direction, not back and forth. But this thing is spinning around at a very high rate of speed, and it needs to be balanced. In other words, this side can't be heavier than this side or else it'll wobble, and it'll cause... It'll basically wear out the bearings in the engine, and bad things will happen. So you want to balance this after you've ground it. There's a couple of ways you can do that. You can get this little, it's like a $2 balancer gizmo. Or if you don't have one, you can use a big nail. Slam it into the side of a table or something and see how level this gets. And you can see this one is not level, so in other words, we're gonna have to take some more weight off of this side here. A little bit more grinding in other words to make this like this. If you have one of these little plastic leveler things, they're really kind of fun. Just put this on here. We'll let it settle. And that's showing us that we have to take off more material here than there so it'll be level and spin nicely. Much better. Alright. Ready to put it back on. By the way, this is a companion video to our How to Tune Up Your Lawnmower video. Link will be in the show notes for that one. But let's take this puppy, put this back on. So your clamp can stay right where it is. We're just gonna move this shaft a little bit so that the mower blade will pop on and spin the right way. There's little notches right there, little holes where that sits. Don't lose this. Maybe anti-seize compound on there or some oil would be nice. So when we go to tighten this, this will hit, well, it hits the clamp but it would hit the wood as well. So it allows us to tighten it. Again, don't use an adjustable wrench. Use a socket set or the right wrench for the job. Righty tighty, lefty loosey. Do it tight and then just a little more. Like that. Be sure to remove this clamp before you start the engine. Might be something that I've done before maybe. Or tried to start the engine. Pressure wash the interior, or scrape it with like a wood scraper. Does really well. Remove your plastic.

Vid39,Install a Motion Sensor Light - GardenFork,everyone welcome to garden fork today we're gonna put in an outdoor motion sensor light on our garage and we picked the coldest day of the weekend to do it what are we gonna train a motion sense well you know when you pull up in your car and it's just kind of dark out I like it so when we pull the truck up that the lights turn on and we can see where we're walking and everything yeah the mozz well snow the idea the motion sensors light turns off after like five or ten minutes bring the ball here bring it here come on very good Annie bring it come on give me the ball so I am NOT a licensed electrician I'm a homeowner if you have doubts about whether you can do this don't do it hire electrician check with your local building codes so what you're allowed to do in your house all right and let's go motion sensor fixture you can buy all sorts of different kinds at the store I like this kind these have the incandescent bulbs the ones that have the halogen bulbs they tend to burn out and they're kind of they're more difficult to replace the first thing you have to think about where you want to put it on your garage I'm going to put these so I don't have to climb a ladder to change the bulbs okay so I'm going to put it right up here yeah well it's a small I don't know so but the I think the best way to do this is to wire this whole unit while you're on the ground and then you can climb up there and put the whole thing in what you're going to need is an outdoor electrical box you're going to need your motion sensor you're going to need some wire this is 14 - it should be an outdoor great if you can if you can't isn't first off start off is your outdoor outlet comes with a bunch of plugs to plug the side holes I mean you can put your outlet coming out of whatever we're going to use the one so I put silicon seal and screwed all these in alright this isn't the perfect caucus I don't have the super duper just throughout my shoulder on that way so wait Loes what have you got loose what did you blow out of the garage so this is a little wire stripper for this is called romex well I don't know that's what I call it but you strip down the center of it you could also do this with a razor blade or a knife so this is two insulated wires and a bare copper wire like this cut that off turn that off the excess you got the cardboard insulation strip off this and this yo you're doing as much work as you can before you get up on a ladder you get it that Ricky Ricky but hitman three this goes through here all three of those yeah yep the whole thing the whole thing down the back you screw those down so you've taken your ground wire and attached it to this kind of green blue screw here your ground wire this is to mount the light this will come in the kit you know metal gets really cold on the outside and when you touch it with your bare hands it's even colder don't be like Eric and have to do this three times take this gasket which comes in your lighting kit have the wires come through there these are called wire nuts okay this parts easy match up the wires to the wires the colors of the wires you want the white wire to the white wire okay so that screws onto there pull it to make sure that those wires are tight pick the black wire same thing this is going to go together like that you can bend them down into the box well make sure that the make sure you can't see any bare wire throw the ball it's all the way down there my hands are cold this thing goes right in the middle here okay we're ready this is all wired up put the wire coming out the back now we're going to put this up here so figure out where you want to put it and you have to drill a hole in your wood or your vinyl siding or whatever it is be careful maybe should wear safety goggles goggles when you do this take your wire if you have a garage that has sheetrock walls this might be harder because you're going to have to fish the wire through the wall down into an electrical outlet but we happen to have a really old garage and there's no interior wall so if you have any questions or you want to learn about wiring go get a book go to your library and check out a basic wiring book you learn a lot easy so again if you're not comfortable with this or if your local building codes don't allow you to do this don't do it okay but I think you can do it always check to make sure the power is turned off in the air you're going to be working in go to your circuit breakers see which ones to turn off test it with the tester can we do that yes what I have here is I have an electrical outlet already nearby in my garage here so I made sure that I turned out the circuit breaker and I test it put these wires with a little tester nothing comes on I pulled this out so when you take your the electrical tape off this outlet you see there's some screws on each side the black wire or the ground wire and white wire on this side and there are extra screws here and here so what that allows you to do is you can bring another wire in and run your electrical power from these screws here up to your motion sensor light cool huh so I take this and I loosen the clamp this is kind of the toughest part just because it's a lot of a lot of wire so you always put your loop in a clockwise direction that's because when the screw turns down it tightens the loop up these are the ground wires and you want all ground wires to be connected because you don't want to accidentally shock yourself from appliance or something tight like that white and white black and black copper and pop once you're done putting all the wires on you take good electrical tape and wrap it it doesn't help that this is really cold but wrap it around all the terminals of the outlet and this will keep it from accidentally shocking somebody if they happen to take this thing apart and the circuit breaker isn't turned off it's just a it's just a good thing to do you know because it might be you opening it up again or somebody else where the screws are those are I call those the terminals so you just want to use your electrical tape to cover those screws because they are exposed exactly okay I'm going to put this all together unscrew the Box on put this back in you can literally shove this back in because everything's all covered up now and then we'll wait for nightfall okay so we're testing out our we're testing we're coming to the driver here and let's see what happens okay the lights don't come on oh they are you gotta be backing up all right there you go so there's a little sensitivity adjustment at the bottom of the sensor there we'll just tweak that a little bit I didn't want it set on maximum because then every time a car rides by or something the light will go on so we'll just tweak that but it looks like Maxima so anyway you can do this I mean again I'm you know none of us are licensed electricians so check with your local codes and everything the one thing I forgot is when you're putting the outdoor electrical thing there you should put some caulk across the top when you mount it against the wall of your house because that keeps water from running behind the outdoor electrical box so little thing there all right you can find us on Facebook you can find us on twitter we have garden fork radio which is our great internet radio show that people like to listen to as well it's more of me talking and email us or like us on facebook whatever you want all right so make it a great day and it's snowing 
Vid40,How To Stain Wood - GardenFork,"- Nice, huh? But now the challenge here is to stain these doors. And it's a little complicated by the fact that these are pine doors, and this is oak trim. And we went with the pine doors, really for budget reasons. Oak doors are wicked expensive. But now we wanna stain them, and I wanna show you guys how I do wood staining. I'm pretty much novice wood stainer, but again it was an opportunity to show you guys how to do something, and the best way to do that is by doing it. You learn by doing. You don't wanna stain these in place, because people are living here. We're gonna take these into the shop, and stain them there. Alright, here we go. (upbeat music) Staining wood is not hard, but what's key is the prep. And I'm not one for details, and this is very detail oriented, but I'm gonna make it happen, and I'm gonna show you guys how you can do it too. Couple of key things you need. First of all, the stain ingredients, I call them. If you're gonna be using pine, or a soft wood, you need a pre-stain conditioner. This is really important. I skipped this the first time I did it, and I paid the price. The stain is really blotchy, on pine and soft woods, if you don't use this first. You want the stain itself. We'll go into this more as we're applying it. And then, a polyurethane. This will go on a couple days later, after the stain is dried. To prepare this, we're going to use a 220 grit sandpaper. This is this new sandpaper I just got at the store. It's like sandpaper on a flexible film. Be really good for getting around the corners and stuff here. Some gloves, always good. Some blue tape is handy to have. These are called tack cloths. It's cheesecloths that is impregnated with I think beeswax. It's for pulling up the sawdust from the sandpaper. And then I like to have, these are cut up old t-shirts, which is kind of like a lintless cloth. And then, these are, I call them chip brushes, there's the inexpensive, disposable brushes. I use this for applying the stain. Screwdrivers always handy. Six in one. Oh, and I forgot. Ventil- whoa. Ventilation is key. Usually in Garden Fork, my mantra is, if all else fails, read directions. When it comes to staining wood, read directions. Especially on the back of this can, before you dump stain all over it. Remove all the hardware. Come on out. There we go. So I've got a worn out sanding sponge here, and I'm just gonna take my new sandpaper, and wrap it around there. Doesn't have to be perfect. And then the key thing is, we're gonna sand ... Well we have to sand the whole door, but specifically, these areas here where a router has gone, is rougher than the smooth parts here. We wanna generally sand with the grain of the wood, but when we come to something like this, I usually go in here with my fingers, and smooth out like that. Don't forget ... It's not part of my Star Wars uniform costume. A really good mask. A dust mask for when you're sanding. And then this, I think it's called an organic vapor mask. It makes an amazing difference when you're dealing with oil based paints, and stains, and stuff. You know that headache that you get? It's either non-existent, or greatly reduced with a good mask. Don't cheap out on this. I'll link in the show notes to one that I use. Okay, these are all nicely sanded. It takes longer than you think it will. Now we're gonna hit it with a vacuum, and the tack cloth. (vacuum) Tack cloth. So to figure out which color we wanted, what stain color we wanted, I bought little jars of a bunch of different stains here, and did some tests. I first treated this whole piece of pine with the pre-treatment stuff. I can't remember what it's called, but that stuff. And then I did one coat of each, and labeled it. Labeling is important. And we settled on this one up here, the red mahogany. And then to figure out the depth of darkness or tone we wanted, I did another set of tests here, which are two coats, one coat, and also lengths of time that I left the stain on. Seven minutes before rubbing it. 15 minutes before rubbing it. And then I also did a couple where I put polyurethane on as well, because the polyurethane will change the color. It'll deepen it, I think, as well. So do these tests, before you stain. Just so everyone got it the first time, this is really important. So this door hasn't been treated yet. This door has. Following the instructions that come with your pre-stain wood conditioner, and I wipe down the excess, because that's what it says to do. I let this sit as long as the instructions say. So again, you're in a well-ventilated area, with a mask. We have our stain, and a brush. So then after that set amount of time, you take your t-shirts, and wipe this down. You don't wanna rub real hard. You just wanna get up the excess. This looks really nice. This just shows that if you do the sanding, and then pre-treatment, it makes a huge difference. After you've done your wood treatment, and you've laid on your first coat of stain, you sometimes get this kind of weirdness here. Don't worry about it. Happens on the first coat, not on the second. Rub with the grain of the wood. Here's our first coat, looks really nice. Then we have a problem. I don't know what happened here. But, this is all splotched. No fun. Man, whenever I do a stain job, I mess something up, and I think what I did this time, is I took the brush from the stain, the wood conditioner, the pre-stain conditioner, and I think I just took this, and boop, dropped right into the stain itself. And so, I tainted the stain with wood conditioner, and that's all I can think of as to what created that. The only way to really remove stain from a piece of wood, is by sanding it. So, that's what we're doing today. What fun. (sander) (light music) With the help of my visual aides here, and half a day of sanding. So I basically sanded the areas that had the pockmarky, blotchy stuff on it. The other pieces were fine, so I'll just carefully, if that's a Garden Fork word, stain these other pieces here. We're good to go. So I'll condition, and then I'll stain. I wanna show you, by the way, the very cool exhaust system I've built, because I'm working in the basement here, but I've got a super exhaust system. Come here. (fans) Looks so much better. You know, you lose a day when you mess up, but I thought, I don't wanna buy a new door, and redo the hinges, and the door hardware and all that, so ... After you rough sand it with a belt sander, I went over it with the palm sander, down to a 220 grit, nice and smooth. And then it's time now for the second coat of stain on these doors, because we did some color tests. That doesn't look very good. But, multiple tests of double coat, leaving it on 15 minutes, or five minutes, what's it look like with the polyurethane on it. And we determined that two coats, at about seven minutes apiece. So today we're gonna do the second coat. Make sure you have ample ventilation. I rigged up three box fans, pulling the air out of the basement, with a fresh air intake over here. (light music) Okay, so, second coat is on. Depending on ... It just looks really cool like this. How dark you want it to be, is how long you leave this on. If all else fails, read directions on the back of the can. Looking very nice. Just gonna let this dry for now. Then we're gonna flip them over, and stain the other sides. Really nice. This is what the doors look like after two coats of stain, and three coats of polyurethane. If you wanna learn how to polyurethane wood, there's a link below in the show notes, and hopefully there's a button up here that you can click as well, to see our how to polyurethane wood video. The Labradors are down here. Anyway, I just wanted to show you that it might not be the most perfect project in the world, but you learn by doing, and that's what I did. And you can do this. Just, ventilation is key. Good vapor mask is key. Experiment on some scrap wood, before you work on the expensive wood. It looks really good. So we have a ton more videos like this. I call it Eclectic DIY. It's cooking, gardening, home improvement. Check out our channel. The link is right below here, and if you have any ideas, or suggestions, or questions about staining wood, please talk to me in the comments below. I try and respond to most everything there. Alright, if you wanna see the polyurethane video, the link is below as well. So make it a great day. I'll see you later. (light music) Are you hungry? (barking) "
Vid41,You Can Repair A Palm Sander - GardenFork,"- I hate throwing out tools, especially tools that I think I can probably fix. We're doing a staining video right now, I'm staining some pine doors and I made a huge mistake. Here's our first coat, looks really nice. Then we have a problem. I don't know what happened here. Not unusual. There's a link below to watch that video there. And I need to sand down one of the doors again, and I was like, well I need my palm sander. Both my palm sanders are broken. Long story, but we were dry walling a 12-foot high ceiling and one of my team liked to sand down the butt joints with a palm sander, And so he used my sanders and I think I can fix them. They're broken now, I think it's an easy fix, and I thought let's just show people don't throw out your tools, take them apart, try and fix them. So today on Garden Fork, power tool repair. Here we go. (upbeat music) I picked up a spray can of electronic cleaner. This stuff's handy to have around. And I got a Phillips. These are really deep screws here. Do this on an area that it's okay to make a mess on. My counter is perfect for this. That comes off, put that somewhere safe. If you look down in here, you can see these are Phillips screws, so that works. Sometimes they're torques, which makes things a little more difficult sometimes. These are coming out, well this one comes out easy. So we'll take these out. You know, we had a tool bucket video the other day. Today on Garden Fork, the tool bucket tour, blah. And I talked about these little different sets of drill bits I have, drill points, and this is gonna come in very handy for this 'cause it's kind of hard to get out. So I'm gonna take my deep, long, put it on my screw gun. This, to here, it's nice. (drill buzzing) There might be a screw under one of these labels, I'm not sure but I'm gonna try and split this. Don't cringe, this is a disposable wood chisel. Make sure this is unplugged, by the way. There's an O ring here that's holding this together 'cause that' a little seal. Take that out. I'm gonna take the pad out. (drill buzzing) Nice. Two more screws holding it in. You wanna take one side off and hope that the motor stays with the other side like that. Okay, there might be a reason why this thing doesn't work any more. I'm hoping between blowing this out with some compressed air, cleaning off the electronics with the electronics cleaner that this will look a lot better and start running again. 'Cause, I hate throwing stuff out, so, it's all about fixing. If I can do this, you can do it. And at worst, it doesn't work already. This is a really cool project, I think, for kids, this is how I got into fixing things is my dad brought home broken tools and I would take them apart. Make sure it's unplugged by the way. Alright, tea, go outside. (dogs excitedly barking) Wear eye and ear protection, it's gonna make a lot of noise. (air hissing) And I'm gonna spray on the brushes and I think this is called the commutator. If your brushes pop out, you can just push them back in again. (spray hissing) That looks so much better, let's see if it starts. (fast forward mumbling) (drill buzzing) Alright, moment of truth, I think if this switch is burnt out, maybe I can just hard wire it and put an inline switch here but let's see what happens, this might spit out a bunch of junk. Ready? (clicking) Darn. I was hoping that would work. (clicking) I want to test this switch real quick, so that's off, that's set to on. I've got a multimeter set to one of my ohm settings, when these two probes make contact, electrical contact, that goes to zero there. Goes back to zero, there you go. So I'm gonna test across these two connections here now that the switch is turned on. So, it's hard to do this and run the camera. (mellow jazz music) (sander buzzing) Whoa! I forgot to unplug the sander before I started testing the switch. So, that's why that thing jolted like that. But, that tells me that the problem is probably in the switch. I'm going to hard wire the motor to the power. This switch, I'm going to disconnect and I bought an inline switch that will replace it, right. Make sure this is unplugged, proceed as follows. I want to keep as much of this wire as I can, so I'm gonna, that was graceful. Take apart this switch, then I'm gonna cut these wires as close to the spade clip as I can. Then I'll strip these. So then I'm gonna take those two wires and put a wire nut on there. We want the wires to follow their original route so they fit when the case goes back together. Wire up your bypass switch, cut the rubber here and here, don't cut all the way through it. Alright, that took a while, but we've got he common wire going across, the black wire going through the switch. (sander buzzing) I was able to fix the second palm sander by just taking it apart and spraying into the switch with the electronics cleaner. Just jammed it in there, worked really well. Boom, we're good to go. So, you can do this. Should I turn these on, yeah. (sanders buzzing) If I can do it, you can do it. Let me know what you're doing in the comments below.

Vid42,DIY Pallet Pry Bar - GardenFork,"(hammering metal) - Are you tired of breaking apart your pallet's like this? - [Woman] I am. - Stay tuned for a new tool on Garden Fork. (light piano music) First I wanna give credit where credit is due. I didn't invent this. My design is a modification of two different designs that I found in Instructables from Ribitsky and Darren, so a big thank you for them for giving me the genesis of the idea. Here's what I built. I'm using angle iron and some black pipe here and I built... Oops. So, to start out with, I have a piece of 3/4 inch, three foot pipe with a 3/4 inch right angle here and my idea with the right angle was that this would be increased leverage when you're prying and then I took an angle bracket here and I laid it about where I thought it should go and I marked it here and then I drill-pressed. I drilled these two holes. (light piano music) (drilling) I'm just gonna make sure that these are all truly 1/4 here. (machinery sounds) So to assemble this, I've got two 1/4 inch, these are Grade 5 bolts, which is a little higher-quality bolts. I've got some 1/4 inch Nylock nuts and some oversized 3/8 nuts to act as spacers, some regular washers and some smaller bolts here with lock washers. Lock washers are the key here for everything. So our 1/4 inch bolts go through two of the pieces of angle bracket. - [Woman] Okay. - [Eric] And then I slide on two of the oversized 3/8 nuts here, one 3/8 nut here and three washers. - [Woman] So two on one side and one on the other? - [Eric] Right. - [Woman] Oh, okay. Oh, good. - [Eric] So you space here... And I put it on backwards... This should be pointing the back. (metal scraping) (light piano music) Then we take a lock washer and one of these Nylock nuts. - [Woman] They're the key, I remember. - Yep. So we've got these two brackets on each side and they could come apart, so I'm gonna put a bolt here. (metal scraping) Now the fronts of the brackets are held together. Alright, assembled here. My thought with the elbow is there would be some increased leverage when you're bending back on the pallet. Be curious to see how that works out. But this, I like it, there's no welding. You can get this stuff at your hardware store. Oh, I forgot to do one thing, hold on. So our angle brackets have a little sharp edge here and I'm just gonna round that down so it doesn't punch holes in the pallet wood. (grinding metal) (dogs growling and moaning) (crunching snow) Ready? (wood separating) - Oh. - How cool is that? - Yeah, it's gonna break. (sighing) - [Woman] Is this part of the trial and error? - [Eric] Yeah. - [Woman] It was really cool while it lasted. - [Eric] So these bent quite a bit. So my thinking is, I'm gonna double-up and have four brackets on both sides of our tool. Ready? (metal scraping) (light piano music) So I want these four brackets to work as one, so I'm going to put two bolts in each side of the bracket. (grinding metal) (light guitar music) Alright, four on each side. Tighten this all up, let's go test it again. Alright, here's our new rig. (wood splitting) Wow, much more solid, much more solid. (light music) (wood cracking and separating) My goal here was to be able to go to the hardware store and buy the parts to make a pallet breaker and we're able to do that. I can see some refinements, maybe some stronger bolts here and stuff, but that is for you guys to figure out. I've gone this far, can you take it farther?

Vid45,How to Install a Bathroom Sink Faucet,"(smooth music) - He's busy. - Come here. What are you doing? Hey everyone. Today, we're going to put in a bathroom faucet. The pups are going to help. This is really simple. Ours we're going to have to do a little bit of extra work on because it's very old. But I just want to show you if you want to replace the faucet, is it leaking or something. You can do this is your kitchen or your bathroom, your utility room, or wherever you want to go. Right, guys? - As long as you have a milk jug. - This is a very inexpensive play toy for puppies that they like. It's a milk jug. You just give it to them, and they go. Ready? Go! Hello, Mitchie. Hello. - Do you know have your Mr.Magoo glasses on? - Yeah, I got my Mr.Magoo glasses on because I need to see close up today. Usually, underneath your sink, you already have these turnoff valves like this. In our house, we don't have them. So we have to put these on first. We're going to have to de-solder this joint right here. Then we're going to put on a fitting, and then I'm going to put these on here. - What's up with the tin foil? That's not usually in our bathroom. - No, but the tin foil is here to protect the paint. Because we're going to be using a propane torch fairly close to the wall. You should have your fire extinguisher close by. If you don't feel comfortable doing this, perhaps you should have a professional do this, alright. This is not part of the official how-to, this is just Eric doing it. Because propane near a wall can start a fire. Okay! - Should we hire a professional? - No. - Oh you are a professional! - I am a pro; no I'm not. (laughing) I'm a master of the obvious. - How's that going Moose? (crinkle) - What I forgot to mention is we need to remove these copper pipes that are going up into the faucet. You want to disconnect them before you try to pull this off because it makes it really hard. The problem is those pipes are connected up in there in a really tight space. Hello, again. So what we're going to use is a faucet nut tool. This is the kind of thing you'll only use maybe once in a lifetime, but my father-in-law David gave this to me a couple of years ago. - (laughing) You just poked yourself in the eye. - I said what am I ever going to do with this? And today, I know what I'm going to do with this. Alright, so thank you David. This reaches up in and turns, So if this is the nut, it grabs onto the nut and turns it. Oh, it turns it that way. Those two nuts up in there, you can see the copper pipes go up in. We need to disconnect those nuts from the bottom of the faucet here. (clanging) So, I can't get the wrench up in there. It basically looks like we're going to have to take the sink off to get the faucet out, which is not surprising because this is an old sink. That's how they used to do it. I have to de-solder the other connection and this should fairly easily pop off the wall. We say fairly easily, but we'll see what happens, alright. (ignition) (blow torch) (laughing) - It's hard to solder with puppies licking you. (laughing) - I'm playing with fire. (laughing) - Do not do this at home. - Oh, there we go. This is a puppy. (laughing) With a milk jug. These are the joints that we have to disconnect. You can see how tight that was. Just not able to get in there. We need to take these nuts off of here and we can remove the old faucet. - Argh! - You can see what life is like here. - He's not our's. - He's not our's, he's Bill's thankfully. (laughing) - I took the nuts off. Now this is ready to come out. (clanging) - Oh, 50 years of what else? - 50 years of soap, that's all it is. This comes out. You can see that's pretty old. - Did you have to measure so you know what size the new one is supposed to be? Or is it all standard? - These are standard four inch. What you do is measure from the center to the center. You measure from the center to the center of the posts. (child yell) This is four inches. These are called four inch posts. (child laughs) It's a pretty standard thing, but you should double check. There are some weird sinks out there. Here we go, this is our new fixture. It has a gasket, here. This goes like that. These go here. These are much easier to put on that the old ones. This does not have to be super duper tight. Just tight. Okay, to connect your valve, which is going to be on the wall here. To your faucet, which is here. We're going to use these newfangled hoses. This is a flexible hose that has a stainless steel protective braid around it. One end is half inch FIP, which mean female, and IP, I don't know what that means. Basically, this means it will screw into the faucet. It says here, faucet connector. The other end is a 3/8 compression connector because I bought the 3/8 compression valves here. The beauty of these, is that they're very flexible. You can even bend them like this. I bought two different lengths. I'm going to opt to use the longer one. If it's a little too long, what you can do with these, is you can turn them like this, which is very cool. You don't have to line everything up perfectly that way. It's like a garden hose with a flexible shield around it. If you have questions, go to your locally owned hardware store, okay, and ask them. Find the oldest guy there, because he knows everything. (laughing) Except me. Alright so, to make this easy, we're going to connect these and we're going to connect them on here. Now these are hand tight, alright. Hand tight and then a quarter turn and that's it. If it's too tight, it will distort this washer here. This is a rubber washer. You don't need any teflon tape on this. Because the washer makes the seal for you. Don't use any teflon tape on these. Our sink already has a stopper mechanism in it. If you're putting in a new sink, you'll have to put in one of these. It's really simple, just follow the instructions that come along with it. From the new box, the new faucet box, I've taken the faucet stopper rod and the extension and I've connected it to the existing rod here that controls the faucet stopper. Okay, so I put our threaded connections on here, now I'm going to use teflon tape. You put teflon tape on in a clockwise direction. You just pull it like that. Then we put our new valves on. Then you tighten these. This we can take and curl this in a circle and connect that. These go on finger tight and then we're just going to do a quarter turn, alright. (water running) - We're not use to that. - There you go. Alright, so there you go! Really simple. Should be a little less complicated than what we had to do with this one. That's because it's an older faucet. You can do this. Just be careful. Follow directions that come with the box. Watch our video and learn a little bit. Then come to the Greenhouse. - Tin foil your wall. - Tin foil your wall. Yeah, you probably don't have to do that. But I caution against that. Then come to the Greenhouse. Green-house.tv and tell us what happened. Take some pictures, make a video of it. Alright. Ready guys? (smooth music) See ya later. "
Vid46,How to Repair a Dripping Outdoor Faucet - GardenFork,so this valve is leaking it's turned all the way off I can't make a turn anymore and what are still dripping out so this means there's a rubber stopper or a rubber washer or a rubber seal in here that we have to replace if you try and tighten this down anymore all you're going to do is break it so don't do that so first thing I got to do is turn the water off inside so we find the valve that controls this valve here's the valve that controls the faucet outside turn that off regarding the they're like two statues on either side of the like of the public library instead of lions we kept your debuffing alright so the cameras running cameras around put your hand through there okay and you just pointed at me if you want to get any closer what do I punch to make it run it's running now oh it's running so I don't look do it look right here this I and that's what I'm seeing yeah okay very good it's not too hard that's easy yeah so how long does this operation take well in a perfect world about five minutes but but this is not necessarily a perfect world there explore on phone Erick's world so let's say you have to take that I don't know what you call that the knob of the valve ah there's usually a screw on here there's no screw on this one so just on one arm could be a handle I guess I call it and you know I'm I'm at a loss it's a very familiar thing but you call the attorney for anything the turning thing that makes sense so what you want to do now is you have to take the valve the valve assembly out of its housing the valve assembly okay you can use a crescent wrench or a pipe wrench we're still turned off downstairs which I turned off about down sir yes that's a good idea okay yeah that's not so you're gonna count this thing I just close up close up I just want to come up get in close here so I've got the pliers on the bottom of it this can be kind of tricky to grab onto it because there's just not a lot of surface area there to get your wrench on but you get that off you pull that out and that's the seal that needs to be replaced so before you fix this leak you go to the hardware store and you buy a box of assorted flat washers to fix about or what you can do is you can go to the hardware store with the valve that you take it apart and you can match this washer they've got these little drawers full of washers and Henry let's go to the hardware store so we're going to go to hardware store go to the store yeah come on let's go that fits right there I'm just going to work in yeah yeah you don't want to eat that alright let's go so we're going to take the old washer this little screw here we're just going to take it out this pops right out and we're going to put the new wash we just got the hardware store in there and I'm going to do this by holding the camera alright one hand that comes out take your new washer put the screw in there and put that in there there we go before you put this back in the valve housing you want to make sure that this is all the way in the open position other words it's not it's not screwed to the off position but it's all the way to the on position because that way when you screw this in you won't match the seal the washer into the end of the valve seat so this with our new washer goes right like that just tighten that down this can be a little tricky close it down and we're going to turn the water on check it turns off no drips there you go so it works yeah - are you darling well the water was in the shirt off hasn't anybody you're not necessarily too shocked if they'd want to bend over like this well I can go up but then I can't get you in the water unless I go further away well we proved that the water works we prove that there's water here and though I don't know if you can prove that it's not leaking thinking we think it's not leaking we know it's not leaking you know it's I see a drop coming out I'm not I'm not allowed to say that oh you're not allowed but there is a drop right oh that's the packing this leaking won't fix that if after you've replaced the washer then you get water leaking out the valve stem here you need to tighten up this thing called the packing nut here and I can tell this one's loose just by going like that so you want to have the valve open all the way and then put a wrench on the packing nut and tighten this down and that stops that that tightens up the valve tightens up the seal around the valve stem and there you go good job yeah no leaks drip is gone no I've got you in the picture I forget you're in the pictures we call the closer so the closer once again to the show yeah I got it anyway you can see it's easy enough to fix your leaky valve just go to the hardware store buy us a little assortment of washers one of them will barely fit if it doesn't take the valve down to the shop and they'll fit you a washer and it's easy just remember to turn the valve up inside before you do any work and have your neighbor like Charlie here too to hold the camera perfect at all right thank you you're welcome goodbye I'm tired you can stick a nap you 
Vid47,How to ( or how not to ) Cut Down a Tree - GardenFork,you want to learn how to cut down the tree okay Andy your formal introduction to framing look good today we're gonna know all right today we're gonna cut down a tree and we're gonna use the chainsaw to do it it doesn't work maybe we should do the opening later okay say to the camera we're gonna today we're going to chop down a tree using a chainsaw but first some safety precautions cool Eric why are you wearing those jets so I up so I don't cut my leg off by accident or bleed all over Bill's lawn here so right when you're using a chainsaw chainsaw is the most dangerous tool you can own without having to have a permit or a license to use this thing these things will they won't cut your leg all the way off but they'll they'll cut in deep enough that you can bleed to death if there's been a lot of injuries with chainsaws people go to the store and they buy one and they don't take the time to learn about it and they don't wear the proper safety equipment the most important thing I think you need to own is a pair of chainsaw chaps so these are they're not always orange but they're a tough nylon material and then they have a Kevlar fiber in them and what happens is if you're cutting and you accidentally get near your leg the chain will cut into this and then what looks like a just bunch of giant milkweed pod things bursts out and jams the saw and keeps you from cutting your leg so basically these things will cause the chainsaw to stall a while ago I was kneeling down like this and I was cutting a limb and the saw dropped down and got near my knee and I don't didn't really know how close it was and all of a sudden a bunch of this white puffy material comes out of the chainsaw chaps and jams the saw and all the sudden the saw stalls and I'm like oh gee what's wrong and I realize that I almost cut into my kneecap here with the chainsaw so even people like me who think they know what they're doing need to wear stuff like this it's because I wear a chainsaw chaps but I still have a knee here so it should be noted that Eric is being able assisted by his friend Bill mr. Purdy nesco right we have to thank bill from the camera today once again you need to have ear protection and eye protection when you're running a chainsaw you might not think you need ear protection but the drone of that chainsaw can start to diminish your hair in high education we're gonna cut down a tree I can barely hear myself it sounds weird I'm gonna take that off we're gonna cut down a dead tree in Bill's yard that is right smack near the lawn it's a little bit of a danger of dropping on to his garage ordinarily I'm not a real advocate of chopping down dead trees unless they're in the way or unless they're in danger of falling in a building or something because dead trees in the woods are great for birds because birds are typically cavity nesters or their limb nesters and dead trees are great for that woodpeckers will poke a big hole in the tree for their nest then the next year some other cavity nesters that doesn't put their own hole will go in there and they have a nest in there then so we know when you're building birdhouses you're building a substitute for a dead tree so if they're dead trees on your property and they're not in the danger of anything just leave them up because they'll eventually fall you know mushrooms will grow on them then you know crickets they'll move in - and also - organisms will break them down but if it's not bothering anyone that's not danger of falling in hurting someone or hurting a building then just leave it up but this one is dead all right modern-day chainsaws have some safety features on them that you need to look for the most important one is a kickback bar here so basically when you're chainsawing sometimes you can hit something in a log and it will cause the chainsaw to kick back toward you and what this brake does is it kicks back and your arm hits it like that and it stops the chainsaw from moving if you don't have this kickback bar you're sawing something it could go cook like this and I'll chop your head so you want this feature it's called a kickback bar so your chain sawing and then like that it stops the song okay so how do you chop down a tree to drop the tree you first you have to look at it and figure out the easiest ways to see would look away look at which way it's leaning we're gonna cut a wedge out of this tree on this side because it's gonna drop this way and then we're gonna go to the back of the tree and cut into the back just above that wedge and that'll create a hinge and the tree will fall in theory it will when you're going to cut down a tree you need to plan your escape route you have to when this thing starts to fall you don't want to stand next to it you need to move away from the tree so the best thing to do is to move at a 45 degree angle away from the tree you don't want to move straight back behind it because this can kick to the back I know Erica you made a challenge yesterday that you're going to mark exactly where the tree is going to drop I am we're gonna pick a point here I'm going to see how close I can get the tree to dropping right there sure I'll bet Freitag I'm gonna drop it right here let me get a stick and I'm Markin when I got a better stick it's gonna go right there okay this is our mark no look at cool Erica say hikes thanks we send the boy in the house with the dog that way we don't have to explain to his mother why we flattened him with a tree make sure you've checked the oil without chain oil reservoir and also the gas make sure that you use a chainsaw that has a sharp blade take the chainsaw out to a tool repair shop a lawnmower repair shop has a blade sharpened don't try and do it yourself buy a spare chain they're really easy to put on and that way if you dull it out using a really hard wood you just put a new chain on make sure there's no one around take you in the house we're drunk okay we'll cut our wedge so this is it this is a pretty good lunch but it's not perfect but you can see we have this last step right here we're going to make that cut the tree will drop pretty close to where we set it a drop my chains get a little dark I change the chain where's the stick the stick is right there with a tree fell hey Birds I need a call on this he didn't actually hit the stick wait a minute let's reconstruct the trail here okay little tree reconstruction okay now I'm gonna give Eric five dollars there we go your dad's got to pay up 
Vid48,"Truck Repair, Spring Hanger Shackle Bracket Ford F150",you gotta give me the first bag if you want me to throw it you got to give in me come on you want me to throw it you want me to throw away hey come on Reggie set good boy drop drop as when I throw it cause Henry's right behind them Henry come on Henry Henry pops up everyone today on garden fork is truck repair day or maybe frisbee day I'll have you've noticed but the the truck kind of the back end of the truck always tilts down to one side and it's not the screws that are broken excuse me come here so it's not the spring that's broken it's the bracket that holds the spring to the frame of the truck it's called a sometimes called a shackle bracket so this is an 82 Ford f-150 but so it's an all truck meaning every time we crawl in a that you're going to get filthy so wear your safety equipment because your head is going to get full of dirt and we'll show you how to do this this is really simple if you have an older truck you probably already know how to do this but might be a little entertaining you watch you watch me fix my truck all right things we remember eye protection and ear protection because going to using power tools I put on these latex gloves because we have to go to a cocktail party tonight they want me to throw the frisbee and fix the truck so we're going to crawl into the truck get extra sawzall blades because you're going to need those we're going to cut off the shackle bolt and we have to grind off the chassis bolts and that's going to take a while so so here we go I feel like I'm like the spaceman lying down here or something this is your shackle bracket this is what's broken up here is a leaf spring with a connection to the shackle bracket and the shackle bracket used to be connected to the frame right here so we take these bolts off and we have to take this big bolt off as well so I have to cut the bolt on this side where the nut is so we can drive the bolt out that way to where mentioned Henry wait let me throw this they'll do this all day Wow it's really hot these are saw blades for our saw they wear out very quickly so if you see here this is all after a couple of minutes so you're going to go through a number of blades just to get this bolt off so the beauty of this kind of blade is when you bend the blade you just give it a twist and it's marginally straight again you just keep on using this until you break all the teeth off so we cut that through that's a beautiful thing now we're going to get the boat down wow that came out really easy so this is the bolt this is the bushing and this was the nut but just look at the t rated that is there's no way we could have got that off without a sawzall to get these bolts off we're going to have to grind them off because there's no way you can get a wrench on those anymore there we go that fault there is what we got to get out don't like me I just under the truck that's pretty good so now we'll go to the other side and try and pull these out all right so I got the chisel under here and there we go all right that's number two so we're just going to whack these with a hammer and try and drive them out see if I can get this to move all right these are my trusty assistants you guys want to help me we got to put the bushings in now together can you do that with me okay so we finally got the four bolts out so this is going to be easy now we put the bushings into the spring we connect the oh the shackle bracket to the spring and we have to jack the frame up a little bit just to drop it right in the right spot we put the bolts through onto the frame and we're done all right guys these are your parts this is your shackle bracket here these are your bushings now we have some new bolts put it all together so here we go so now we need to raise the body of the bed up to back to where it's supposed to be because that's where the shackle bracket lines up okay so we've got the shackle bracket line up the bushings that goes in the trick now is that we got to get this spring in the shackle bracket to line up with those holes there and there's some tension on the spring here so we're going to play with this for a while mitch is helping me fix the trim now I got the shackle bracket into the leaf spring and I'm lining up the four holes of the shackle bracket to the four holes in the chassis here so I just got to move it around a lot put them in line that up our bolts are in very nice there we go what is that look at that nice and level alright so there you go that's how you fix the shackle bracket on your 82 Ford f-150 okay if you want to do that kind of thing it's a it took a lot longer than what's going to show on our little episode hello hello anyway thank you to my trusty assistants here and visit our web-site garden for TV check out our other show real world Green Comm and send us emails tell us your friend telling tell us your friends tell us about your friends tell us what you

Vid49,How to Build a Bat House - GardenFork,hey everyone these guys really want to go outside right now but we have some work to do so we're gonna stay and we're well they have some playing to do we're gonna be in the workshop today we're gonna show you how to make a really simple bat house we got this neat book from Bat Conservation International and bats are really important they eat a lot of bugs and I want to dispel some uh notions people think that they're dangerous something they're not and a bat house is a really simple way for your kids to learn about this you basically take a 2x4 piece of plywood we cut it a couple times and we make one really simple even I can do it so did you know I'm going to make this why they play they're not at all they're very beneficial um they like very specific structure so we're gonna and they love mosquitoes and what's not to like about anyone that eats mosquitoes no what are you doing all right here we go now I'm going to show you a premium item know what now you all know the Eric outfit is a black hooded sweatshirt but did you know black hooded but you can get custom garden fork and rear will green shirts and sweaters and all sorts of stuff on our site there's a link at the top and you just click on it we make a little bit of money okay a little bit not much um but you can customize this I got a black with the white writing I like that and also watch real do you guys watch real-world green which is art yeah she does it's our other video show it's practical tips for green living it's like it's green for the toolbelt crowd so for your bat house you're going to want to go to a lumberyard and get outdoor plywood at the home-improvement stores you can buy a pre-cut two foot by four foot piece of outdoor plywood this is called CDX plywood or you can take a 4x8 sheet and cut it down if you know how to do that but the beauty of this thing with these instructions from back conservation or national so we make a couple of cuts in this and we build a bat house really simple you can actually bring the cutting instructions to the lumberyard and they will cut this for you I think might charge you a dollar that's what I do but you want to patronize at your local lumberyard and ask them to cut it for you if you like what is this what is this we have a box of tennis balls we've bought on eBay and Michie knows where they are always wear eye protection and some ear protection you're not gonna get a date like that now bats like things they like warmth and so to make the bat house warm we paint it dark and the conservation guys suggest staining the interior of your bat house with a dark outdoor stain so that's what I did we rarely have this organized but I already have some pre-cut pieces and I stained the inside the interior with a darks outdoor stain these are lines that I scratched into the plywood the the plywood is really smooth and when bats they need something to grab onto when they're gonna climb up into their bat house so you can either take a sharp knife an exacto blade utility knife and scratch lines into this what you can also do is use wire wire mesh from a window screen and I think that works better so that's what we're gonna do here I just I scratched these in to show you all you know if you don't want to do the window mesh you can do this that's like a waterproof windproof draught proof home they like the little spaces and I like it to be waterproof which is why they like your attic because they wedge themselves up in the corners so we're going to use caulk to waterproof it and we're going to get screws to make it all tight and by the way we learn this already but use caulk that is paintable because we're gonna paint this afterward and you'll see why later okay get yourself a nice gun this was like nine dollars you use this you just this to cut the tip well ideally you cut the hood maybe I need a new guns we have a top and two sides like this so we're going to do is we're going to lay in a bead of caulk yeah so this goes on here we put the top on some of the caucus gonna squeeze out of here but that's okay you see how it comes out right here that's okay so we've got the the one by two's screwed into the back of it and again you could cut the you could score the whole back of it with a shark you know like a utility knife or something but what I did was I had some mosquito screening laying around and so I cut it just to fit inside here oh by the way you don't want to wear our nice clothes you know by the way you don't want to wear nice clothes when you do this because the car can get over everything and a wet just a towel a rag with a little water on it will clean it up off your hands and off your tools whatever so now we're going to put on the two front pieces we put a top on and then there's a half inch gap for some ventilation and then this one goes here well I just made a mistake in measuring the cutting so see know it well ideally the one by two is don't jut out but that's more on a craftsmanship carpentry question it's not the bats aren't gonna look at that and say oh it wasn't made very well we're not going Erick house you know my father-in-law would make it precise but I measured very quickly so okay oh I forgot we got a again always and you want to  these joints to keep we're keeping water out all right so there you go you've completed the caulking and screwing here you can see especially on the top there's a lot of caulk has oozed out here and that's okay you can take a rag and just wipe this if we're making a waterproof house for bats bats like it warm and waterproof and they like it high up if you put this like six or eight feet up on a wall it's not gonna work I would say at least 12 or 15 feet earlier we need to paint the exterior of this and we're going to paint it black if you live in the southern states you want to paint this a gray or even a white depending on how hot it gets in your area here is your completed bat house been painted black on the outside this is an outdoor rated latex paint that I used also as an option you can put a little roof on the top and that's what I did to help further keep water out of it you can notice here some little weirdness right here that's because I didn't use paintable I just had some bathtub  which did it work but again the whole thing is black the screen has been trimmed we have our nice air gap this can go up if you build two of these and put them back to back like this with another 1 by 2 in here you've got a 3 chamber bat house alright so there you go come to our site Green - house TV to learn how to do this and other cool stuff watch real world green as well our new show by our t-shirts is my shirt get a sweatshirt we will you know we make a couple bucks but got a makeup look somehow but this is good for kids learn about bats bats are good for us we love bats they're really neat to watch it so make it a great day yes I'll see you later Jessica's best for dad yeah Gus I can't talk anymore for sure it's the pressure of making the show 
Vid50,Replace Wheel Bearing How To GardenFork,today on garden fork learn how to change your front wheel bearings stay tuned hey everyone welcome to garden for today we're going to show you how to replace the front wheel bearings on your car truck this is our f150 and the front end oh say sorry the front end of our vehicles making this wrong or what noise and that can mean a number of things but I know on this truck that it means that the front wheel bearings are going bad pay no attention to the dogs and Frank come here guys come here go who's that so this is something you can do you need to have some tools you need to set aside an afternoon to do this you need a track you need a truck or car this is for a rear wheel drive vehicle if you have a front wheel drive vehicle you can apply these same how to's to replacing the rear wheel bearings because the front wheel drive car doesn't have an axe on the back right so you can do that I don't know wait I know what I'm talking about alright start off with let's go first you have to get your car off the ground you have to take the one in the front tire so if you take it off one at a time and I use a regular floor jack for that you can also use a bottle jack this is a bottle jack they're a little more inexpensive that a lot more portable than a floor jack floor jacks are kind of big you just keep that in your car all the time yeah the first thing that you do is you loosen the lug nuts on your tire and then you jack the car up but then when you want to go work on your car you lower the jack and put the car on a jack stand the jack stand is under here so you don't get crushed this is your jack stand yeah you see it's right underneath the wheel I'm going to be working on and that's holding up the weight of the car cuz I can lower my jack here let's see that jack stand is holding up the car because hydraulic jacks every once in a while will let go and you don't want to be underneath your car truck when that happens and when you're jacking up the front of a vehicle be sure to chock one of the rear wheels this is your caliper this is the brakes that stopped the car this is the brake rotor these are disc brakes this is a disc brake rotor we have to take this off to get this off which is the hub and the wheel bearings are inside there there's a number of ways a caliper will come off a lot of times there are two bolts on the back side of this this has these pins which we're going to drive out there's one of the pins that hold it in success there you go Wow looks bigger than I thought right now you don't want to disconnect this from this hose here that was my next question so you want to hang this up in here out of your way in it coat hanger so your caliper coat hanger up to there it's out of the way if you take this and you jam it in the side of your rotor to keep it from moving you can grab it here oh there you go that's all it is that's a cap that's your castle nut wheel bearing is in there Oh take out this cotterpin cotterpin can you spell that please co tter Oh like welcome back yep see that's not untied at all problem no you want to be about 16 foot-pounds to be technical this is the outer front wheel bearing roller bearings these wheel roller bangs I think are fascinating there they just really need this hub slides off like that here we have a wheel bearing seal and then the inner bearing is here so to take that seal out and on the other bearing and clean out the hub there you go that's the old seal that we throw out that is the inner wheel bearing these bearings sit in what's called a race can you spell that our AC e like race car resource yeah you're going to take a couple rags and get all this grease out of here even though grease is good right but this old grease is what we want to remove because the old grease has the steel basically the wheel bearings wear down that's what's causing a roar roar roar toys and they're wearing down because the metal of the bearings these little rollers are wearing out and chipping off and so those little metal chips are in the grease that's in here now we have to punch the races out of the hub the races are the circular metal rings that hold the bearings into the hub so you get yourself a metal punch like this and this is kind of hard to see maybe we can get the camera in here you see that little Ridge right there instances we're going to go to the outer bearing is all the way down in there and something sometimes there's a notch that you can punch but we need to get that sleeve that race out of there right this is the bearing race you can see I punched it out I've almost got it all the way out that's the bearing race that's what you want to take out there you go all right now clean out the hub get a bunch of rags sometimes spring some carburetor cleaner in here helps I just want that clean both sides you want all the old grease up these are your new wheel bearings Neha this has to go into here by the way these rotors are going to need to be replaced soon but I wanted to make a video about replacing wheel bearings so again yeah alright so we just tap this one in likely tapped in the other one so the race is in now we're going to put the inner wheel bearing end but first we need to pack it with grease here's your wheel bearing grease here is your wheel bearing there are a number of ways to do this if you have what's called a bearing packer it's a lot easier but you want to cram grease in to the insides of this bearing so just take it in your hands and mu in there anymore is better when it comes to wheel bearing grease ok that goes in there that's the goal the way to the goal next the inner wheel seal goes on you've got the spindle clean we're ready to put on our so we've got the inner bearing in here with the new grease and the inner wheel bearing seal that goes on like that this is your outer wheel bearing and then this goes in this washer goes on notice how it's got these little flat sides that'll only go on a certain way to check how many foot-pounds or those how much torque you should apply to tightening up that nut you can check with a manual repair minute this is a castellated washer lock washer that goes on there get a new cotter pin take that and Bend that up and bend the other side up to get this caliper to go back on it sometimes helps to push this piston in I'll press that piston in don't do it fast just do it slow nice huh nice yeah nice hey wheel bearings are kind of messy but you can do them so we're gonna put the wheel back on we're good to go got some apples from the neighbor oh now you're interested all right there you go thanks a lot for watching we got more videos on our site we have one about how to replace your disc brakes we're

sometimes it just goes straight into the side of the pipe and then put in the back here in the back here is a valve going to a flexible line here and here's the valve and we're going to turn that valve off that turns off the water supply to the dishwasher if you don't have a valve coming off the side of the hoses feeding your faucet you should go downstairs and turn the water off downstairs at your water main where's the electricity you're supposed to under tange oh right here is the plug for the dishwasher newer dishwashers usually come with a power plug rather than being hardwired go downstairs and turn off the circuit breaker if yours is hardwired but this isn't so we can just take this and pull it out and your dishwashers disconnected these are my sister's dogs this is Harry and Hazel they're both rescue pups from where Diana's grow Diana's Grove yeah excellent along the edge here are going to be some screws like that and my dad does not have a cordless screwdriver screw gun so we're just going to do this by hand what's that then that's a screw gun this is very garden fork this is why I like this what I learned on alright this isn't going to work but we're just gonna use our screwdriver and that's my brother car there helping you with the dishwasher some dishwashers have a this one on the counter there's a kick plate going across the bottom of the cabinet so you're gonna have to unscrew that and take it out kick plate comes off and then this it just pulls out you lift it up you might be careful not to scratch your floor cuz this little middle feet at the bottom of this thing walk it out a little bit all right something that catches so marriages there you go that's a dishwasher this is the water line that goes up into the wok the dishwasher so we have to disconnect this water line I'm going to read you that this is a adjustable crescent wrench no wait a minute there's an easier way to do this so the easiest way to get the dishwasher out is just to disconnect this this is the supply line I'm just going to make sure that the valves turned off and disconnect that line and then we can pull the dishwasher out you might want to put a little bowl under here cuz some water it's going to come out this is the drain we disconnected from under the sink so some water is going to come out of there okay so this is out now we disconnected the drain the electric and the supply line we're going to take this out in the garage now it's really like it just it's a plastic box basically we're going to remove this hose and reuse it right here what is that what you got there dad oh don't you know what at that score no tell us will you put this underneath the washing machine you tilt it this way it's flipped over then you take it down put it construction way it goes you're going to remove your supply line and this right angle fitting here if you're putting in a new one that you know there isn't an existing one in there you have to go buy this kit it's called a dishwasher installation kit so as long as this hose is in good shape you can reuse this if it's kinked or leaking don't use it go buy new it this box here is where your power cord goes in we just remove this little screw why are we taking out this thing for the power supply this is the power cord for your dishwasher and we're going to reuse it because most dishwashers don't come with the power cord so we're going to take it off the old one before we put it out for the recycle guys come pick up those little screw comes out that comes out again this is unplugged while you do this and you disconnect these wires out save your wire nuts my brother put this in so you can tell look at all that cable tie which is unnecessary but so you have your power cord from your old fridge on your old dishwasher with the strain relief and feed that through this hole read the directions that come with your dishwasher tighten that down with your pliers so again we've got white wire and white wire twist the two white wires together we take this wire nut twist that on and then we check make sure that it you can pull the wires doesn't come apart so we have a right angle adapter for our water supply we're going to put teflon tape on that and then this goes right in here and falls off you want this to point toward the back of the dishwasher like that these are compression fittings they don't need teflon tape not too tight just pull little tight like that so redo directions but this going to clamp like this if all else fails read directions this is the right clamp for the drain just read the directions that tell you that there you go bunch better clamping alright our hoses are going back through the original holes so my hand is under the cabinet here I'm going to pull the hoses through as dad pushes the dishwasher in alright there's some little feet there's some little feet on the bottom of your dishwasher to level your dishwasher so you want I'm going to bring it in and out a couple times make sure it's level just screw and unscrew the feet there's four of them to make it level because level is important level is important you like that with the hands yeah very affirming yeah be sure to read your instructions because the way the drown is drain is routed is important because essentially you have to put a little trap in this tubing so you have to sometimes cable this up into the corner of your dishwasher mount and then have it go into the drain but it'll show you how to do it in your instruction series we just put that in there yeah I know we forgot you have to put that insulation which where it says do not remove we actually removed it so you put the insulation around this thing it keeps it much quieter so under here are usually two brackets sometimes so it's more and then there's a strip of wood under your cabinet and you will screw this I've cured your screw done it'd be a lot easier you'll screw this up into the wooden alright plug in the power turn down the water valve connected the drain if you have to go downstairs turn the circuit breaker turn on the circuit breaker and now we press that sounds ok to me clean dishes here we go clean dishes alright let's see what happens we have to wait now keep an eye on we want to run it through a cycle and when it goes into its drain cycle make sure that the drain is connected it's not leaking anywhere look underneath right now like I'm going to do make sure there's no water dripping from where we connected the hose to the valve get some donkus yeah it's not leaking but I'm being licked so so you'd like to dishwasher I love it it looks beautiful beautiful you did a wonderful job all right there you go subscribe if you like our show is a subscribe button or leave us comments below or send me an email Eric at garden fork TV alright thanks for watching [Music] [Music] 
Vid52,How to Build a Window Flower Box - GardenFork,everyone welcome to garden for today it's the Labradors of course we're going to show you today how to make a window box a window box or like I guess I call it a flower box sometimes but a box that you can build to put flowers outside one of your windows and usually flower boxes you buy them and they're kind of pretty and then they rot and fall apart the promise is because you're putting dirt into wood so I have this kind of I don't know if I invented it akin with this idea I've had to make a flower box that won't rot so we're gonna take it downstairs well I don't know I came up with this idea that I'm sure other people have cuz I've rarely have an original thought in my head but the trick to these is what she makes your box it's a crammed full of plants as we've heard in a garden show once to cram them in like a city bus city vet crime you know so you want kind of overflowing amount of flowers in there that's like it's rush hour so let's go in the shop me pups in China do this here is the secret to your wooden flower box this is a plastic insert this is you can buy this at any garden supply store get one of these and get yourself a 1 by 8 this is a 1 by 8 by 6 you can also use a rough cut wood which is what the ones we showed you outside are made of and you're going to make basically a rectangle box a wood box that goes around this plastic box that's all we're gonna do so we're gonna measure these dimensions right yeah cut a piece of wood and screw it together and show you how to do this alright so this is 24 by 8 let's say yeah 24 by 8 so we're gonna make two pieces at 24 plus 1 and a half because 1 by 8 is 3/4 wide so we're gonna have two long pieces that stick out so we can put the ends on so it looks like a nice box wait you need to make that that oh if you have your pencil it's in the plastic box so it's 24 right plus 3/4 plus 3/4 so that's an inch and a half so that's 25 and a half the width of this thing is 8 inches so we need two end pieces at 8 inches Barracks carpentry oh by the way also get two big brackets like this brackets that are big enough to go across the bottom like that now ideally this would be what's called glued and screwed and I can't find oh we use a waterproof wood glue called gorilla glue and I think one of my friends borrowed it cuz I can't find it anymore didn't put my name on it so somebody took it pilot hole let's pretend this is wood glue it isn't wood glue but it's not exactly waterproof Oh glue it's more powerful than nails and screws by the way alright so we line that up oh yeah totally oh yeah those norm Abrams have these problems someone took his gorilla glue that's really pretty glue oozing yeah yeah you need you'd be surprised with how little glue you can screw it together glue is incredibly strong especially with pieces when you're gluing pieces of wood together these are inch-and-a-half screws I did you could use nails if you want if you're going to glue it I like screws ideally they are a deck screw I'm sure we're gonna get some mail because we're using drywall screws you don't want to be like flush or anything that's pretty good take the spot here it's looking like something it's looking crooked yes I'm measuring okay well trim it down so you want the lip to be a little bit above the other thing you want to do is you want to have drainage in the bottom of your plastic so just drill a bunch of holes okay for window boxes dry out really quickly so what we do is we put in these crystals is called Tara's orb there are other ones but they when you want you mix us in with the soil and they soak up a bunch of water like a sponge and they slowly release it back into the soil in between the times that you water so when you forget to water this might save you a might save your plants and it's really cool it's really cool so we have our interior planter our decorative outside you want to take this sand the corners nice if you want to be really fancy you could fill in your screw holes we're just going to paint this white you have to prime this with an out ideally an outdoor primer a stain sealing primer is best because these knot holes will bleed through and if you're painting this a light color the knots will bleed SAP through and stain the paint but if you like that you know that's fine it's rustic right so this gets primed and then painted bracket fracas do you paint the bracket no I don't think you're gonna see them but if you if you think you might see them you can paint them as well I'm gonna have this bracket stick a little bit out so the back edge of the planter is not smack up against the wall of your house because when you're watering some soil might splash or water might splash and you don't want the wood planter smack up against your house like that you want to have some air in there there's our planter huh this would be painted plants go in here let's go give a rough fit and see what looks like so this goes right here it's a beautiful thing isn't it you can figure out how high you want it you know you don't want it right up against that window you want it spaced off a little bit so it could go down here nice huh with this ingenious plastic within the wood that's kind of what's gonna break the glass now now I want to be careful all right so there you go that's impressive nice huh you know it's kind of 100 I had one of those aha moments I was like you could put plastic within the wood paint this nice whatever color your house is whatever you want so if you want to learn more you can come to our site garden fork TV tons of videos there if you're watching on itunes not all the videos are up on itunes they're on our site and check out garden fork radio our audio podcast oh yeah because Eric's got a really good story this is a really good story this week you're not gonna believe this one trip to the emergency room story so not me not the dog but Eric himself all right

Vid54,Pallet Compost Bin - GardenFork,"(leaves rustling) - Hey everyone. Welcome to GardenFork. Today, build a compost bin out of wood pallets. Super easy, free wood, big bin. - [Camera Operator] Ooowee! - These guys are obsessed with the tennis ball. They love the cold weather and I'm gonna have to throw the ball the whole time we're building this thing. - [Camera Operator] You must be exhausted. - Because they know when we whip out the camera it's time to play ball. (laughing) (leaves rustling) - All right, four pallets. You can find them probably at a hardware store or big box store. Just ask them hey, do you have any pallets? And they're gonna say, oh yeah out in the back, go have some. Ask first okay? They might need the pallet for something. But, sometimes they're recycling, but if they're throwing them out, go get them, all right? - [Camera Operator] Is that made out of a particular kind of wood? - Uh, I don't know. A lot of times it looks like they're made out of oak or poplar or whatever they have. Save the nicest looking one for the front of the bin. This is the nicest looking one, so we are going to set this one aside. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna build a box out of pallets. It's gonna be a tall box. It's gonna be a little off-level because we're on a slop here but that's the way it is. So first, we're just gonna tie these together lightly and we're just gonna put some screws in through the pallets here from the side pallet to the end back pallet. Oop, backwards. (drilling) Just to hold it there so we can work on it. Then we're gonna make a little stronger connection with some shelf brackets I found off the street. - [Camera Operator] You're very economical. - Well, people throwing them out, and I was like, oh yeah let's use them. All right these are some brackets that I found on the street. Somebody was throwing out some ugly shelving, so I took the brackets off and took them home. So we're gonna use these brackets to hold our pallets together. One at the top, one at the bottom. (drilling) Nice. - [Camera Operator] You want it pretty secure because eventually when you put all that compost in it, it's pretty heavy right? - There's a lot of weight. This is going to be a cubic yard of compost when it's full. That's a lot of weight so you want to securely put these together. (leaves rustling) - [Camera Operator] Want to see what will happen if I don't throw it? (dog barks) That. It'll get louder. (leaves rustling) Ooh! It's a twofer. It's very tall, your compost bin. - Yeah, we're building a bin for, we're ideally gonna make it a high heat bin or it could be a cold composting bin. But we need mass and we need it all held together and we need air. You're gonna get air from these open slats here. - [Camera Operator] Sure. - You can do this. I do it. This is the easiest one in the world. Besides just a pile like that. - [Camera Operator] We call that the rabbit warren. (leaves rustling) - Charlie. (leaves rustling) Henry. (leaves rustling) This will go on all day if we let it. (leaves rustling) - [Camera Operator] What do we do next? - We're gonna put up the other side of the compost wall. - [Camera Operator] Will you tell us later what the difference between the high heat compost and the other? - Actually, Sarah and I got together and we have a whole basic composting 101 video about carbon and nitrogen ratios, green to brown ratios, high eat versus low heat composting. There's a link at the end of the show and in the show notes here for that. But we'll talk a little. - [Camera Operator] Sounds technical. - You can really geek out on composting, but watch this video and the Sarah and Erica basic composting 101 video and you learn. (dog barking) - [Camera Operator] Hold on. All right. - If you don't have some brackets, there's a number of ways that you can connect the walls of the pallets. You could use metal banding. You would wrap this around the pallets. Or you could use wire. You'd run the wire around here and wrap it tight like coat hanger wire. So if you've got these brackets, great, but you could use banding, you could use wire, coat hangar wire or you could even use blocks of wood in here to tie the two together. - [Camera Operator] Oh yeah. - [Instructor] Use what you got. - [Camera Operator] But not twine. - No, twine will just break down and then it'll kuh. - [Camera Operator] It'll become part of your compost pile. - [Instructor] So on the front we're gonna take some little pieces of one by two. I mean, whatever you got. And I just want this offset so it sticks in here a little bit because our door is going to sit on these. So just screw that puppy in. (drilling) Like that. Make sure it sticks into the compost area here, okay? And again, offset into the bin area. (drilling) So I'll put our hinges on the inside. (drilling) - [Camera Operator] Looked like you were gonna get your finger. - [Instructor] That's happened. (drilling) - [Camera Operator] Sounds a little creaky. - Pallets the wood kind of sweats sometimes. We'll be okay. (laughing) (leaves rustling) - Hinges on. Door open. - [Camera Operator] Wow! Does it open all the way? - I gotta trim the wood a little bit. (laughing) It'll open when I'm done. So just right here, I just have to slice this off. See how this one sticks out and binds into that? - [Camera Operator] It touches. - [Instructor] Because all the way down here it's clear and open, so this is just binding. - [Camera Operator] Okay. - Easy enough. You like that? - [Camera Operator] That means easy enough. - I think. - [Camera Operator] What's the snarfing going on behind you? Hold on please. Oh my goodness! What are you doing? What are you doing? That's silly. Is that very entertaining. (leaves rustling) - [Instructor] All right I have a little piece of chain and a screw with some washer on it. This is gonna be holding our gate closed. Oops, if I could just use a screw gun. I'm really good at this. (drilling) There you go. And then I put a little screw on here. This just goes on. Well it goes on in a perfect world. There you go. - [Camera Operator] Pff. That is beautiful. - Well if you have a fancy latch, you could put a fancy latch. It's just a compost bin. And that'll keep it from opening. - [Camera Operator] Will it get rusty and rustic looking and like it fits in the woods? - Yeah and then you could sell it for a lot of money. Rustic. All right, you built your bin, congratulations. But, if you notice, it's a little wobbly. - [Camera Operator] I'd say. - So here's an idea for you. Get some kind of a stake, a metal stick would be better. I had some old metal pipe laying around. And we're gonna put this through the pallet itself. - [Camera Operator] Oh, threading if you will. - Inside the pallet like that. As tight to the front as you can, and we're just gonna hammer it in. (clinking of hammer) Nice. A little stronger that way. You could also wrap some banding around the pipe to the pallet if you want. - [Camera Operator] Are you gonna do that in all the corners? - Just two, just the two fronts. Because the back is pretty sturdy, but the front is where the door is hinged so it'll hold it better. - [Camera Operator] Yeah, gotcha. - You can keep your food scraps in the refrigerator or in one of those canisters with the charcoal top, you know filtered thing. The end of the day, end of the week, send your kids out here, there you go. More compost. - [Camera Operator] Cool. (laughing) - So you can layer this all with stuff from your garden, leaves from your yard. We talk about carbon and nitrogen ratios and how to do hot and cold composting in our composting 101 video. There's a link at the end of the show for that as well. From your kitchen, just avoid meats and things that are saturated with oils, stuff like that. By the way, we put out new shows ever week.

And if you have any questions or comments, leave them right below here. I try and answer everything I can. All right. - [Camera Operator] All right you're projects done. Let me go check on Charlie pop. - Yeah, what is she doing? (leaves rustling) - [Camera Operator] Still digging. It's been a good show Charlie pop. Been a good show. (laughing) (leaves rustling) (gentle music) "
Vid55,DIY Brick Pizza Oven Tips - GardenFork,"- [Eric] Today on GardenFork, some hints and tips on using your brick pizza oven. Stay tuned. - [Camera Women] Smelling pizza? Not yet. - Hey everyone, welcome to GardenFork, another one of our pizza videos. This is outdoor brick pizza oven, hints and tips and tricks, stuff that I've learned. If you're come across this show, we have an original video about how to build our portable outdoor pizza oven. Links are below, in the about section or at the end of this video. But I wanted to do another video about stuff we've learned, cooking with our outdoor oven and other people have learned. There's been a ton of great pictures people have sent in about portable ovens that they've built, brick ovens. Neat, huh? - [Camera Women] So improvements? - Yeah. Um, I don't want to heat up my wine, so. I made a list. - [Camera Women] You're about to burn your list. - Yeah. If you are using used brick, used clay brick, and used clay brick is always in slightly different sizes. We got a big pile of it and they're all odd sizes, so, you should group together same sized bricks when you're building the base, the sides, and the top. I learned that this time because I was building it and it wouldn't come together. The front metal bracket, we're using these angle irons that we recycled. Thee front one goes face down rather than face up. Makes it much easier to put it together. - [Camera Women] What else? - You want your portable brick oven on a really solid foundation. If you use cheap saw horses, this is what happens. - [Camera Women] You have a collapsible oven. - Yeah, we have a collapsible oven. So, we use these ones and it just went fump, right over. When you're firing your oven, don't use green wood. Learn from me. - [Camera Women] It's actually the color green, too. - Yeah, you want the driest wood possible, this is white oak, red oak, I think, is even better. And you can use scrap lumber from a project as your kindling, use a lot of paper, and don't crunch the paper really tight. Loose paper, dry kindling, or scrap wood and then I like oak. Don't put the big oak pieces on at first, get the thing firing and then start laying on the big pieces of oak. Make sure the length of your firewood is less than the width of the pizza oven. 'Cause you're gonna put, right now I've got them laid in like this, but when we start to fire the oven, we're gonna go like this and shove it to the back. - [Camera Women] Oh. - So you don't wanna have this wedged in a weird way. When you light the fire, when you're lighting your kindling and paper and everything, remove the back wall brick, the center, top brick, so it creates a little flew effect. When we're getting ready to bake the pizzas, we're gonna put this brick back in. But for now, just open that up so we get some air flowing through and it fires a little better. I'm using the word fire a lot. - [Camera Women] It's a fire. - Yeah, it's great, this is really, really great. Another key thing here, we've discovered, is our pizza dough. We, of course, have a video about how to make pizza dough and we have videos about different pizza ingredients, pizza recipes. The dough needs to be made 24 hours in advance and you put it in the refrigerator over night. It makes the best dough. The dough that you make the day of a pizza day, it doesn't work nearly as well, that's what I think. Now how do you get your pizza in and out of your pizza oven? With a pizza peel. You can go buy these but we made them and of course, we have a video about how to make these as well. There's links at the end of this video and down here in the about section for all our other pizza making videos. But this thing works great, corn meal, goes in, pulls it back out, and you're done. After your initial logs are turning into coals, throw in another log and we're gonna put it all the way at the back because while we're cooking our pizzas, we still want some logs burning because this thing doesn't hold heat real well. Your first pizza is boom, beautiful, but if you're gonna want four or five pizzas, we have to keep the heat going, so throw more fuel on the fire. - [Camera Women] Wear gloves again. - Yep. Alright, this is hot, it's really nice. We put, I put about four pieces of oak in there and the brick is white, and that is a sign that it is quite warm in there. - [Camera Women] Hot. - So take a garden, this is a garden hoe and we want to basically, take most of this and push it to the back, bring a little bit of it forward. - [Camera Women] Why are we doing this? - Because we want some heat in the front and most of the heat in the back. (scraping) My forehead is melting right now, so. - [Camera Women] (laughing) Let's see. - It's melting. - [Camera Women] Is the knob gone? - Another piece of wood, this is some birch I have, we're gonna throw this in. 'Cause we want to keep this fire going, so we're gonna put that up in the back there. - [Camera Women] Is it pizza time? - It's gonna be pizza time. - [Camera Women] He's excited. - I love this. You'll love it too, if you're watching this, there's a reason why you're watching. - [Camera Women] How many hours has it been since you first got this all set up? - You want to start building this four hours ahead and you have to have the fire going three hours ahead, ideally, to have these kind of really nice coals like this. - [Camera Women] Keep an eye on the fire. - Yeah, keep an eye on the fire, wear gloves, be very safe. - [Camera Women] Fire extinguisher nearby. - Yeah, fire bad. - [Camera Women] Fire good, fire bad. - [Eric] Alright, super simple pizza. This goes in, toward the back. Quick pull out. Pizza is in. (metal scraping) - [Camera Women] If the coals touch the pizza, is that okay? - Yeah. Alright, we're gonna time the turn this. Oh man! - [Camera Women] Oh no! (laughing) Oh, we're having birch pizza. (mimicking buzzer) - [Eric] Bad, bad log. Wow. (laughing) - [Camera Women] Well. - [Eric] Oo, that's not good. - [Camera Women] It is like a marshmallow. (laughing) Alrighty then. - [Eric] Alright, what you're supposed to do is spin this, and put this back in. (laughing) - [Camera Women] Yeah. - Alright well, you get the idea. (laughing) Alright, here you go, just some simple hints about using your pizza oven. If you like what we're doing here, you can hit the subscribe button, we put out shows every week and its free. - [Camera Women] They're not gonna like what you're doing here. - That's a mistake. - [Camera Women] There's flame coming out the back, too, what's up with that? (laughing) - I love this, alright, so. - [Camera Women] Let's try another one. - But this is a great way to end the show. (laughing) Okay, second time, take this spin it, the doughs a little thick this time. Put it back on and let the other side cook. Viola. Alright, there you go, I just want to show you some little trips and tricks we've learned. The pizza dough is really key, if you overwork it and then put it in the fridge overnight, it doesn't stretch nearly as thin, we've learned that one. - [Camera Women] We like thin. - I really like thin, I mean, there's really kind of no wrong way to do this 'cause it's just fun, you bring your friends, you know, and make pizzas. - [Camera Women] Are you still having fun? - Yeah! The log rolling thing was kind of fun. (laughing) Alright, but remember, keep the fire going, when you think the fire's ready, that's when you should have the pizzas already ready to go in. The fire kind of peters out, so keep feeding it logs, make sure your logs are dry. - [Camera Women] And secure. - Be very careful around fire.

Vid56,One Sheet Plywood Boat Fail or Float? - GardenFork,hey everyone welcome to garden fork this is one of those lessons learned kind of videos and it's kind of a backwards story so we'll start at the end and go to the beginning okay okay with that this is a Ford f-150 Limited which is a really nice truck battle and I've been talking to the people at Ford about how garden fork and Ford could work together more so my friend Scott at Ford hooked me up with Mike at four trucks and he Mike said let's give you the Ford f-150 for the Memorial Day weekend and see what you do with it and I thought great and I had this great idea to do plywood boat version 2.0 everyone welcome to garden fork this is plywood boat version 2.0 the first plywood vote video is on YouTube it's got like two hundred and thirty thousand views or something if you google plywood vote it comes up first well and people just connect with it which is kind of how people connect with garden for it's us doing stuff and making mistakes and this weekend has been mistake lady you know I do more than they do we pick up the truck in midtown Manhattan and we drive up here on Saturday morning and we're all set pouring down rain and the wind is whipping fiberglass is not like cold weather all right nobody does rain is pelting the tin roof I'm thinking the audio is not going to work I'm trying to put something together with lousy cheap duct tape everything keeps falling apart and all the while I'm thinking I want to really show Ford that the cool stuff we do write epic and none of it's working here's cranky so we finally get the boat kind of together in the garage and we take a break and I realize that our microphone is broken and we've recorded none of the audio I barely have this book together held with duct tape because you're supposed to apply the fiberglass and then I realized I don't have a ventilator mask I have to go get a ventilator mask it stopped and I put the fiberglass on it doesn't dry because it's 40 degrees outside and the wind is whipping and this morning I woke up and I realize that we have to return the Ford truck on Tuesday morning that's 24 hours away far away I'm like how we gonna make a pie and have it fly without video and I thought you know we're just going to tell what happened this weekend so this is what happened you learn by your mistakes and we made a ton of them this weekend and I want to make a really great version 2.0 plywood boat because with the newer plywood and the fiberglass it's really light yeah and we're going to do that but today we kind of had a failure but we learn by our mistakes so there you go we're going to put the boat in the water now and see what happens this new version of the boat is really lightweight that's the whole idea of the thinner plywood in a fiberglass but maybe work take your cell phone out maiden voyage here wait you're luring us onto the rock your land black you need a sail no one does no all right how's it feel that's great it's great that kind of is hard to paddle cause it goes like this maybe a healin no water coming in are you feeling stable do I ever feel stable that's pretty good so you would call this a success totally if I could just get back to shore did you bring any provisions with you I'd like a tuna sandwich how great is that huh oh we're gonna show you the right way to do this on upcoming video but you can do this I can do it this this is actually very true we can all do this is it there's no water coming in no well it was really quick to make - really like amazingly fast all right there you go so I think the the moral of that is that go out and try stuff it might not work as this does but it was a total blast so don't be afraid to try things you know what can go wrong might go wrong and it did in this case here we're gonna learn more about fiberglass I think the big lesson is you need extra hands to do it and don't use cheap duct tape all right so we post new stuff every week if you like what you're seeing here at the subscribe button there leave some comments below if you have any ideas of what we should do and thank you Scott and Mike for the ford f150 that was very nice of them to loan us the truck was very helpful to move the boat around all right go out and do cool stuff come back and tell me about it see you okay - eventually yeah Bota be good I'm thinking a cardboard boat version cuz our town has a cardboard boat race me cardboard boat uh way scuba tank you

Vid58,Frost Glass Easy DIY How To - Window Frosting Film - GardenFork,"- [Woman] Okay, guys. - Hey everyone, welcome to GardenFork. Today, I wanted to show you an inexpensive way to change clear glass to frosted glass. These are some french doors between two bedrooms. And instead of buying frosted glass to put in here, for privacy between the two rooms, you can frost it with this frosted glass material. That you basically lay on the existing glass. It's pretty simple, my sister and I have been doing it, so I wanted to show you how to do it. Ready? - [Woman] Ready! - [Man] So first you precut the frosted material to the size of the window. This has a cardboard backing on it, and that pulls forward like that, right? - [Woman] Right, and there's no glue, it's not sticky. - Right, so then you have a spray bottle, this is just an old glass cleaner bottle we had. And we... Spray some water on there. And then, we have the textured side facing out. And we tuck this up in there. You can pull it back up and lay it back down. It's not like an instant glue or anything. Put your thumb there. Pull it out. You can respray it with water if you want. - [Woman] It's very forgiving, thank goodness. - Yeah. - [Woman] I've been doing the cutting. (calm music) And I think old glass panes are imprecise, right? - Yeah, these are old. This is really old, and it's got a lot of junk on it. Make sure the window is clean first. And then we take some sort of squeegee. This is an old pastry squeegee, we have. And we go across, like that. - [Woman] You're squeezing out the water? - And you're done. - [Woman] Wow! - We're doing this, and I just wanted to share with you all. So, if you have a big window in a bathroom, and you're like... You know, you can still have the beautiful light but you're gonna frost it, and you have the sunlight, but it's diffused so people don't need to see your fine physique through the window. (laughter) - [Woman] Fine physique, yes. (calm music) (scraping) (laughter) - Ain't that cool? - [Woman] I didn't even know you're there. - I'm yelling at the camera. (laughter) No this is really neat, I mean. If you got some glass and you don't have the money to put in frosted glass, you can get this inexpensive film, from the home improvement store. There's a couple different brands. One brand they want you to buy their own squeeze bottle and squeegee. You know, we just use what we got. We just use water with a little soap in it. We had some plastic squeegee things. Make sure the glass is clean before you put it on. And you can always pull it off, you can recut it. It's really quite neat, so I really like this. So, we have a nice kind of visual division between the two rooms, but the light still filters through. So, that works really well for us. Really cool, just like... Well, they're kind of stuck now so I won't open it. Alright, if you like what you're seeing here would you hit the subscribe button? It's free to subscribe, we put up new stuff every week.

Vid61,Building Raised Garden Beds For Schools and More - GardenFork,"- Hey, everyone, it's Eric from GardenFork. This is a really cool raised bed that I ran across. We're at a Whole Foods in Town and Country, which is a suburb of St. Louis. They have a program where they have this Whole Kids Club and they built this raised bed which I thought was really nice. So I wanted to show you another raised bed construction. We have a couple of raised bed videos on our site. You can click on the links to find that. This one's really good for if you're having a garden on concrete, in a parking lot, or if the soil is contaminated where you want a garden. I thought this might be good for school groups that their playground is just an asphalt-topped thing. But this is neat. This is made out of these kind of cement blocks, which are used to build decks and things like that. Pressure-treated 2x4s, and pressure-treated plywood, and then a plastic liner in here. Usually when you're gardening, you don't want to use pressure-treated lumber, but this is building it out of pressure-treated lumber, which means that it's waterproof, it doesn't rot as much, and then it has a plastic liner to protect the soil from the chemicals that are doing the pressure-treating, the wood preservative, as you were. - [Woman] Would it be good on a roof, or does it weigh too much? - This is pretty heavy, unless you're on a flat roof that can bear the weight. You'd have to check with an engineer about that. But this is perfect for gardening on cement, basically. That's why I thought it was cool. (gentle music) To allow for drainage of the soil when you're watering or it's raining, they drilled holes through the plastic, through the plywood base here, so water can drip back out again. Drainage is important. (gentle music) But this looks great. I just thought it was a really great thing, and I wanted to show it to you. There's more gardening videos on our site. You can subscribe to our show. Click on the subscribe button up there. Add your name to our email address, you can do that as well. More of these videos are on our site.

Vid63,How to Repair Window Glazing - GardenFork,so today we're in the basement and I cleaned up my workshop table because my friend Bob here is an expert on glass he's a glazier he does this for a living and my windows are in really really bad shape um so he was so nice to come here and show us how to do this because I've tried this and I've screwed it up so really badly actually I bought this thing that's called a putty chaser and you put a drill out of any garden and it destroyed the wood I guess maybe if you were careful you could do a good job and I I did not few things that we need to start with you need to get get yourself a putty knife I find the ones that are have a little bend like this work really great um kind of just what I'm I'm used to using and also the thing about putty nights and to get a really nice job the the key is to have a stiff a stiff putty knife you don't want one that has a lot of flex or bend to it because you've got to apply constant pressure to the putty as your treasure running it to make the bead nice and smooth and another thing you need is either a gasket scraper or a putty knife with like a sharpened edge just something that you can not to lose putty oh this putty is is really old and dried out and as you can see it's kind of chipping off and flaking so this is going to be really really easy to clean out just trying to get in there look at that that's a bad shape they want to go nice and easy because you don't want to break the glass that's in there um then if you do break it it's not a big deal to replace it but if you can avoid it you want to you want to avoid it and when you're scraping this out you got to be careful because if you look there are points they actually block the glass up it's a little piece of metal like right there a little triangles little triangle and that's called a point so again you just bus all the old buddy out and sometimes it goes little hardness this is when you're doing a just a reglaze like this the most important thing is that you want to get the real loose stuff office if some stuff is still nice and tight to the wood it's okay to leave it so you don't you doesn't have to be completely right exactly exactly we actually we call it spot laser now this is all this is all pretty pretty clean you wanna just to make sure you get a nice smooth edge just clean this up just so that you're not going over any loose stuff because then that will cause the putty not to stick so you want to just get it get all the dust out of there now I brought a putty that I use is called damp take your putty knife and get a handful of putty here you want to kind of squish it all in to your hands and get it all nice and soft and pliable it helps if you have the latex gloves that we forgot to get some but you know and you want to get the putty nice and warm so it's viable and pliable just like kneading bread get it all get it all nice and soft and sometimes we have older putty that's been sitting around your basement for a little while and you want to reuse it and notice when you open up the can if air gets into it it starts to dry out take a little bit of linseed oil and you don't need much just like a little cap full yeah put a little linseed oil in there and knead it around a little bit that softens it up and makes it nice now what we do is you take the knife and you can hold it and you'll see as I'm doing this I kind of flip it around the knife I use it every which way but use it the way that you feel the most comfortable with it you taken I actually pack the putty in there first I just go right down the line you don't have to be real neat about it we can clean it up afterwards just pack it in there so it's all nice and into that groove so you don't have any voids in there and then what I do is I take the knife if you can see I'm I'm kind of putting this edge against the wood like this and I've got my angle like this with the front edge picked up so that I'm not dragging the putty and pulling it out as I'm as I'm going with it then what I do is I push in tight like this and I find the angle and the way I find the angle that I'm going to I'm going to work at is I go by the sight line on the inside where the molding is on the inside because you don't want to go over that sight line you're going to see the putty and inside and it kind of doesn't doesn't look real great so you do is you find your angle apply steady pressure that's the trick steady pressure you just go down and if you push you'll see that you can I'm actually cutting the putty out of the way as I go about both sides and I start to lift my knife when I get to the edge tilt it and then come up like this Wow let's clean corner and then you could just take your finger and peel that out of there and bingo one sides done nice if you look you got a nice sight line - Audrey so you can't sing it a name now the thing is with this putty you can buy all different kinds of body with this putty once you're done you don't want to you don't want to paint it right away the best thing to do is to let it if it's cold out it takes longer for the oils to dry out so the best time we really do this is early fall or in the summer or late spring when it's a little drier weather and it dries out quicker and then you can paint it you have to paint it you don't have to paint it if you don't want I've been like I was taught that you kind of rolled the putty up into a long hot dog and then you stuck it in the groove and I've done it that way too now like on this side um I'm right-handed so it's easy for me to go like this down this side rather than going like this so now that I'm switching sides I'm gonna flip my knife the other way and go the other way Wow I'm just gonna do the same thing just backwards that's amazing just like so I've been dreading doing this and now it's so simple and again the key is having a nice a nice putty knife that's a trick can you get those or any hardware stores it oh you know what we order these in bulk we get a bunch of them at a time and we get them from a distributing company called CR Lawrence this way you can either go come from this end and go that way or I put my knife around go that way it doesn't really make a difference so when I get into the corner now that I'm ready to mend two seams yeah I'll take my knife and I'll put it at an angle and come up the corner like so yeah Wow and then when I get to this edge I'll do the same thing oh it's that sweet come up well now so to get the hook off the glass do you let it dry then you can use Windex or something you can you can clean it right away if you want um the key is not to push hard with the paper towel against the buddy like this putty I mean you can if you run your finger down it or whatever like if you get a little lump like like seal I got a fingerprint on it yeah if you just take your finger well the buddy's still wet you can get rid of that rust on the top so the thing I didn't realize is that you if some of the putty is stuck in there you can leave the old putty in there if it's already if it's adhering well write exams work over exactly I mean it's like you really to make a nice a nice glaze job to make it the easiest it is your best bet would be to get all the putty out of there right if you don't if you don't really if it does or if you really want to reglaze all your windows and you're worried about any old putty being in there and the putty comes out really hard another trick is that you can do is you take either a heat gun and a hairdryer will not work so you need either a never painting paint heat gun or a torch yeah something like this exactly you just want it you know you put your flame on low and just go back and forth and and you just you just warm up that putty until it gets a little soft then you take your torch away and you can just kind of go ahead and scrape right it right down this is the pain we just did and if you look you can't see anybody coming to the inside so you have really nice sight lines yeah cuz on these other ones you can see the putty sticking out and Bobby's does not stick out sign up a professional here so that wraps it up thank you for coming Thank You Bobby and it's time now to the barn again

Vid66,How To Install Window Blinds - DIY GardenFork,"- Hey everyone. Welcome to the GardenFork. I'm Eric Rochow, your host. Another DIY project here. I'm gonna put some wooden blinds in these windows and I thought I'd make a video and show you guys how to do it. There's a couple things you need to pay attention to when ordering and installing blinds, I've learned from, let's just call it experience. But another DIY project, if I can do it, you can do it. Ready, here we go. Most of the time, you're gonna be ordering blinds at a store and online, and you're gonna have to provide some measurements. Learn from my mistakes here, okay. You wanna measure your window, the width of it, in at least three places. I suggest the bottom, the middle, and the top. The reason we're doing this is we want to find the narrowest width of the window opening, because you don't wanna install blinds that you just measure down here, and then maybe, the trim bows in half way up, so that, when you drop your blinds and kunck, they get stuck. It's a bad thing. Again, learn from me, someone that's done that. You can even just kind of move this all the way up, looking for the narrowest width, and that is the number that you provide to the blind ordering people. You also wanna measure from top to bottom. That's a little more straight forward. Go to the top, measure all the way to the bottom. That number is pretty straight forward. All right, your blinds have been delivered. If you have more than one window you're doing, you're probably wondering which blinds go where, because a lot of the windows are similar, but the dimensions might be slightly different. The blind company that I ordered these from puts a label right in here, with the dimensions that you gave for that window. If you wrote those all down somewhere, on a piece of paper, left window is this, right window is that, you can correspond to this. You're also going to get a bag of hardware. Now, usually, you'll use all the hardware that's in here. Sometimes, they confuse you and put more hardware in here than you need because the hardware kit, maybe applies to a couple different ways to mount the blinds. If all else fails, read directions. I mean, watch GardenFork, of course, but then, maybe read the directions. This is your mounting bracket. There are two of them for every blind and they will have a little hinge here. This is going to go up into here, but we don't want it to be smack against the window. We want it to be slightly out away from the window. The reason for that is is this, the window lock. A lot of times, this is left out, and if it's left out, the blinds will hit that out, that unlocked door lock thing. Because we have that gap between the window and the bracket, this comes down, goes right past that door lock. What I use is either a piece of cork or a piece of scrap wood that is about 3/4 inch wide piece of scrap wood. We use our little spacer and then, we put this here, and that will make it such that the bracket is 3/4 an inch away from the window. (screwdriver whirring) Take the piece of wood out and now you've got a nice gap between your bracket and your window. These tabs on the ends of the blinds are for, in case your blinds are just a little too short for the window, you can bend these out and they will snug up against the brackets and make the blind fit better in your window. Can I do this one handed and point the camera at the same time? All right, it's in. Be careful not to get the first blind blade stuck in the bracket, like that, like I just did. So then, this front thing that's hinged goes down and snaps like that. Again, over here, like that. I'm not quite sure which is the top and bottom of the valance, but this is your valance. On the back of it are going to be some little marks, hopefully, and then these plastic brackets go right where that is. On this brand, I take this and I put it in the slot, like that. It's lined up with the arrow and then I turn it, and it's set to go. Keep track of these. I lost one and I have to find it now. Found the other bracket. That's always good. These snap in their little slots here that this plastic grabs in to. Your brand might be different, but this works pretty good. And that valance is not wide enough, wow, uh-oh. That's a bad thing. Okay, found the right one. So again, just put the notches there. Oh, I forgot, put in our control rod. Put this control rod in here. Oh, wait a minute, it's the wrong color. All right, I'm gonna figure out the color issue, but nonetheless, blinds, they fit nice, they didn't bind anywhere. Again, measure at least three places to make sure you don't have a pinch point in your window. But you can do this. It's like bing, bang, boom. If you're going into drywall on the sides, usually there's a stud behind there. If not, you can put an anchor, but drill a test hole first, 'cause sometimes the stud might be spaced behind the drywall a little bit. But anyway, this is wood and wood trim, so I got it, it went in pretty nicely. Remember, just bring the bracket off the window a little bit so you don't hit the window lock if the window lock is left open. But, I like this.

Vid67,How To Cut Tile Easily - DIY GardenFork,"- To connect some tile, I wanted to share with you this cool tile cutter that I borrowed from my neighbor. Just a quick video. This is a little portable tile cutter. It has a water reservoir down here. - [Camera Person] Oh cool! - That keeps the saw blade cool. It has a little handle over here, so you can just carry it around. And if you're thinking you have to do a lot of tile work for a project.. Instead of renting a big tile saw with a big bash tray and all that, maybe one of your neighbors has this, or you can buy it or rent it. But I just want to show you this easy way. It's like cuttin' butter. It's really nice. Where's my mark? I can't find the mark, hold on. - [Camera Person] Your measure mark? - Yeah I might have to measure again. Oh, there it is. - [Camera Person] You have your ear muffs on? - I have ear protection on. It's really cold out. Eye protection. But this works really nicely. Just a simple fence here. Oh, I bumped it. Just lock your fence down. Now when you turn this thing on, the saw blade's gonna whip water at you, okay? (cutting noises) Nice, really simple. So I just wanted to share with you I avoid tile at all costs, but sometimes I have to cut tile. All right, more cool stuff. DIY Garden for it go to subscribe, the subscribe button.

Vid68,Gas Grill Repair - Grill wont light or stay lit - GardenFork,"- Hey everyone, welcome to Garden Fork. I'm you're host, Eric Rochow. I couldn't pass it up. Neighbor had this out in front of his house and I said does it work? He goes yeah, it works. And I didn't wanna drag it all the way home if it didn't work. I'm like you sure it works? He goes yeah, it works. He said that the people that had it in their apartment didn't want it anymore, well it was in their backyard, not in their apartment, and that's like three, four hundred dollars so it's like well, let's see. So it does work but it doesn't work. Here's my issue here. You turn this on, press the button, and this flames up and then the flame goes out in about 10 seconds so there's clearly something wrong. It's getting gas and then it's not getting gas. So the regulator, it regulates the gas flow coming from the tank going into your grill and sometimes it needs to be reset or replaced. So I'm gonna show you a little trick to try and rest the regulator. Now if that doesn't work, then you can just go and buy replacement regulator at your locat hardware store, drop it in, and you're ready to go. Alright, watch this little trick, see what happens. So I think the culprit here is the regulator. That's the little gizmo here. Those things die out kind of just whenever they want. Turn the tank valve off and disconnect the regulator from the tank like that. Now open your hood, turn all your valves to high. C'mon. Now with the valves open and the tank disconnected, you want to wait one minute, or a little more than a minute. You can go watch your Labradors play. (jazz lounge music) (barking) Alright, after a minute or more, turn your valves back off again. Reconnect your tank to the regulator. Regulator and line are connected, this is tight. Now slowly, slowly open up your propane tank, and remember, turn counter clockwise to open up propane tank. What we're doing here is we're resetting the diaphragm in the regulator here. Alright, turn your first valve to high (clicking) and there you go. So if this reset method doesn't work, it's probably time to replace the regulator and I'm gonna show you how to do that right now, okay? Why do you guys want to go inside? Don't you want to hang out here? So your regulator hose comes away from the tank and goes up and into the grill. Now we wanna disconnect that hose right here. So use an adjustable wrench, loosen this, this comes off. Use a vice grip-style locking plier on the gas pipe that the regulator hose goes into. Just be careful not to torque and twist that too hard and just gentle pressure and take it off. So take your regulator assembly to your local hardware store and see if they have a replacement. You might have to order the replacement online. When you're reconnecting this fitting here, don't use teflon tape. This is a compression fitting, okay? You don't need teflon tape or any goop in there. Just go in, hand tight, and then tight a little more. Don't wrench it or you will break it. And use two wrenches, okay? Also, you might need to reset the regulator of the brand new one once you put it in. So again, go through our little step-by-step, like we did previously, and there you go. So proof here that you can get something for free and it works or if over the winter, your gas grill stopped working, don't just throw it out. Take a minute and check it out. Also, in the grill itself, the little burners might be clogged with, like, spiderwebs or something. The little nozzles at the end, you can clean that with a pipe cleaner, check that out as well. And this one, three of the burners worked, one didn't, and I just cleaned out the little nozzle thing at the end of the burner, boom it worked, alright? So we have more DIY cooking and gardening videos on our site and on our YouTube channel. If you'd like to watch, there are links below. There's also links for more DIY stuff at the end here. And if you like, sign up for our email newsletter. It's me with interesting stuff every week that we're doing, alright? So go out and do cool stuff and come back and tell me about it.

Vid69,Hang Ikea Cabinets - GardenFork,"- Hey everyone. Welcome to Garden Fork. Today I'm gonna show you how to hang and Ikea kitchen cabinet. We're doing a kitchen here, renovation. Simple Ikea cabinet. We've done a couple other Ikea cabinet videos, building countertops and stuff. And I wanna show you how to put this up. First, if all else fails, read instructions to assemble the cabinet. Ikea works on a rail system. You put this rail on the wall. Then all the cabinets hang from the rail. Bolt goes through here, connects to here, goes on the wall, okay. We're gonna be putting this on a brick wall If you're using this on a drywall wall, use a stud finder to find the studs. You wanna hang this really in a strong place. - [Brian] What's the name of that cabinet? Do you speak Swedish? - No, it's called the Akurum. The Ikea people are gonna tell us how to say that word. But we got more Ikea videos coming your way here. Here we go, this wall. This is going up there. I'll show you how to do it, okay. You want this bracket to be slightly shorter than the total width of all your cabinets. 'Cause you don't want this metal bracket to stick out the end. Learn from me. So I cut this a little shorter than the cabinet You're gonna find the heighth with a friend of yours where you want the cabinet to be. You're going to mark the top and then measure down because this bracket sits just below the cabinet. Now we're gonna drill some holes to hold this up, okay. - [Brian] Are you gonna be welding that on? - You should always have on the proper safety equipment and then your glasses. Or if you wanna wear your Star Trek outfit when you're on YouTube. We also have a video about how to drill into cement and concrete and how to hang shelves and things. But real quick we're just gonna use this. Always have safety equipment on. The best way to go into a brick or cement is a hammer drill, okay. Go out and buy one, they're not that expensive. Or borrow one from a friend. - [Brian] What's in your left hand? - Oh this is the wet dry vac. It's industrial vacuum. What's here, a shop vac. Is that what it's called, a shop vac? - [Brian] Yeah, whatever. (drill buzzing) - That felt pretty good, didn't it? _ [Brian] Wow, I guess there's holes. How many holes did you put in? - We put in three. - [Brian] Did you explain what the shop vac is for? - The wet dry vac is great because it sucks all the brick dust right into the vacuum instead of getting brick dust all over your kitchen. Or your better half's kitchen, more importantly. Don't do this at home. - [Brian] That's a nice anchor, I mean a hammer. - I can't find my hammer. - [Brian] I know where your hammer is. - Where is it? - [Brian] I saw it over there, hold on. - In a pinch, the back of a pipe wrench is a hammer. We have a center mark I marked on the bar, and I have a center mark here. - [Brian] Why is the center mark important? - So the cabinet is centered. So the center of your sink, the center of the bracket, so the cabinet is centered and life is good. The beauty of this is once this bracket is up on the wall, it's like butter to put this all together. Everything slides on, boom, you're done. - [Brian] Is that leveled? - Yeah, scary isn't it. - [Brian] It's the bricks that are not level. - No, this is a 110 year old house. Nothing is level. So we'll put this cabinet up and the cabinet will be level and it won't look right. Now to get the cabinet onto that bracket, we take these bolts and this back bracket slider thing, this square piece of metal. This goes through here, sits in like that, and then this slides in like that. - [Brian] And then what? - Cabinet, it helps to have two people doing this. But Brian's running the camera. The bolts go through the mounting brackets. Just like that. Then you put on your adjuster and then a nut. These front adjuster things allow you to move the cabinet up and down to level it a little bit more. Really handy. Check your level again here. Use your adjusters if it's not level. Then tighten these nuts with the pliers. Put your decorative cover on. Knobs on, you're good to go. Are you impressed, Brian? - [Brian] You know, I've seen all this hardware, but I never knew how it actually worked. - It all works together. We have more Ikea videos. There'll be a link right after this. But if you like what we're doing here, would you like to hit the subscribe button right here? It's free to subscribe. We post new shows every week. There's DIY, Cooking, Gardening, Bee Keeping, Urban Homesteading. Just an eclectic mix of Garden Fork stuff. We also have Garden Fork radio. It's our iTunes podcast.

Vid70,Ikea Hack For Harbor Freight Chop Saw Table | DIY Rolling Mitre Saw Table | GardenFork,"- Hey everyone, welcome to Garden Fork. I wanted to show you in the shop today, my DIY IKEA hack saw table rig, okay. - I can't wait. - You're excited. (laughing) These guys are excited. (dog barking) Yeah. (dog barking) All right, let's go, it's right here. Isn't it exciting? That roar you hear in the background is our furnace, so if I turn if off, I'll forget to turn it back on. This is called a compound miter saw, it's also called a chop saw. This one, you can cut things with this. It'll slide and cut things. It's a very versatile saw. (laughing) The cool thing is, what I've done, is I've attached a indoor outdoor wet dry vac that someone was throwing out, with a little adapter I bought, at the home improvement store, connected to the back of the saw. I bought this little gizmo online, so when the saw trigger is turned on, it automatically turns on the wet dry vac. So we're gonna suck up most of the sawdust when we're cutting, into here automatically, and I don't have to turn on the shop vac with a separate switch. This turns on, this turns on. - You mean you don't have to remember. - You want to see what happens? Watch. (electric saw whirring) (wet dry vac humming) When this turns on, this unit senses the power draw, and turns on your shop vac automatically. What this does is greatly reduce the amount of sawdust that goes flying around your shop. I mean there's some here, but... It's kind of a neat little DIY thing. To top it off, I had an IKEA rolling wired rack here that I put the shop vac in, and I mounted some wood on the top of it here, and I screwed in my chop saw. What I like about this (chuckle) is I can roll this into the corner, when I'm not using it. It's kinda big, but it just makes it a lot easier and you don't have a big table to move around. So I just wanted to share with you, it's an IKEA hack and it's a nice DIY thing. Get a decent compound miter saw or chop saw. Maybe you have a shop vac lying around you're not using? Maybe there's a broken one your neighbor has? Just fix it up. Put it underneath here. - Just fix it up - Keep your shop clean. - Just fix it up. - Yeah. - Just fix it up. - So there you go.

Vid71,DIY Storage Racks for Garage or Basement - GardenFork,"- Hey everyone. Welcome to GardenFork. I'm Eric. Part of our decluttering, or my decluttering and letting go of stuff... This is my contractor world here. I've got some half-finished projects doing out on the house, and I can't really let go of a lot of this lumber, and stuff, but I can organize it, and more importantly, get it up off the floor. I've got some (wood clanking)... Oh, I dropped it on my foot (laughs). I've got some 2 X 3 pieces laying around from a job, and I had to cut some eight footers short. And I didn't really wanna throw them out, so I thought I could make some brackets, lumber, shelf. Lumber rack brackets out of these. This, chop saw, couple screws and that mess will be up on that wall. (crickets chirping) (dog panting) (water splashing) (dog panting) (saw screeching) (pencil scratching) (saw screeching) Here's our rough mockup of our bunch of scrap 2 X 3s. I'm gonna drill pile holes through here and here. This is what I call a flip bit. It has a screw bit on one end and a drill bit on the other. (drill buzzing) What's wrong with this picture? This has an uneven face cut so when I screwed the two together it's not at a 90-degree, it's at a 90 and some change so, redo this. (drill buzzing) Wow, I'm just gonna go out and cut that flat, okay? All right, I just cut this off, squared that face up. So this, will go like that. I'll be nice. Crossbar, goes in. (drill buzzing) I got this little stop on the end so the lumber won't fall of here. (drill buzzing) (dog panting) ( water splashing) This is a stud finder. Gonna find where in the sheet rock the studs are. I started on what I hope is an empty spot over here. (abrupt beep) (tool beeping) Mark that. And then I come back. (tool beeping) So I know that basically the stud is in here. So I line this up with where the stud is, or where I hope the stud is. Perfect world. Lean in to this. (drill buzzing) That's a good sound. That means we hit the stud. (drill buzzing) I'm putting three screws in. One, two, one on the bottom here. (drill buzzing) (drill thudding) Nice! This is where our other stud is, and we want both brackets to be level. I've got one bracket in already, and I wanna make sure this is the same height. If you only have a small level, take a long piece of wood, set it on the first bracket, put this here, and you've basically made a longer level. And then you can mark (pencil scratching) where you want the other bracket. (drill thudding) You can put one screw in, and then level the bracket up and down, with your level, of course. And then drive this puppy in. (drill buzzing) Nice! Now you can take all your lumber waiting for your restoration projects, put it up here, and then when we're done, we could recycle this lumber somewhere, take the brackets down if you want, fill the holes. That's even more declutter. It's my future. (water splashing) All right, more DIY living videos. Cooking, gardening, home improvement, just eclectic Eric kind of stuff like this. Subscribe.

Vid72,Change the Oil & Tune Up Lawnmower - GardenFork.T,"(light music) (water splashing) (dog panting) - She's heavy. Hey everyone, welcome to Garden Fork. Today, lawn mower tune up. - Tune up? - Yeah, believe it or not, you have to tune up your lawn mower, and if you do, it'll last a lot longer as well and it's actually really, pretty darn simple to do. Even I can do it. - Who are you? - Yeah who am I anyway? If you take care of your lawn mower, it's gonna last a lot longer. I mean it's true you get what you pay for with lawn mowers but if you get a good lawn mower and you maintain it, it's gonna last quite a long time. There's two key things here. You have to tune it up every year, change the oil a couple times that season and also every time you're done mowing, you scrape the bottom of it and get all the grass off. Some of them have an attachment where you stick a garden hose on here, and it washes off all the thing underneath the mower deck. - Is that good? - Yeah it is very good. Okay, step one. Ideally you're gonna tune up your lawn mower when you don't have a lot of gas in the gas tank, okay? But before we do anything else, look in the front and you're gonna see black cable. This is the spark plug, and we wanna disconnect that because it's highly unlikely, but if we somehow accidentally started this thing while we're maintaining it, it's a bad thing. Alright? Oh, I forgot. First of all, you want to run your lawn mower and warm it up before you change your oil. Cause when you warm it up, you're getting the debris and muck out of the bottom of the engine. You're getting it all stirred up, and the oil will carry it out, because we're gonna drain the oil. - So even if it's a warm day, it needs to be warmed up more? - Right, you got to warm up your engine. Watch our Charlie. (lawn mower engine running) You've run your lawn mower about five minutes, you just want to warm it up. Disconnect this. Ideally, you don't have a lot of gas in it, but here's the trick, we're gonna have to tilt this thing. So to keep the gas from spilling out, I learned this from the Briggs & Strattonn website. A plastic sandwich bag, so you take a plastic sandwich bag, stick it over the gas tank, and screw this back on. Its like an extra gasket to seal, to keep the gas from coming out. You've got a, what is this, a dish bucket? Some kind of big plastic bucket. This one has oil because we tuned up our other engines. Put this here and then take out your dipstick. On most of these self propelled's you're gonna dump the oil out of where the oil goes in. There are some lawn mowers where there's a drain plug underneath, and I'll show you where that is as well. But for this, two things to remember, when we tilt this thing, the gas tank side is pointing up, the oil drain side, is gonna go in here. Okay? Don't put this in the dirt. Take this, and like that. - So empty it completely? - Yeah it'll take about five minutes to drain. - Oh you just leave it there? - Yep. So you can see how clean inside of the mower deck is on this one because I clean it off every time. Well this is the first lawn mower we bought, which is a you get what you pay for kind of lawn mower. But this one, I kind of neglected to clean the bottom of it. - Ew. - So you can see. I mean what's going to wear out on your motor is the deck. The grass holds moisture in and it makes it rust. - So this may be a dumb question but, is that whole thing the deck? - I call the mower deck the metal part that the engine sits on. This is a good example of where the drain plug is underneath. So you put a three eighths ratchet in there, take that right out. I think on most of the self propelled's they don't have a drain there because the belt to power the front wheels is right in that area, so they don't put a drain plug there. So, clean the bottom of your mower. It'll last longer. (light music) Alright, this is done. So you're gonna take this, you can pour this in to like a plastic milk jug or something like that and take this down to your recycling center. They'll more than likely recycle oil there, or you can take it to your local gas station or your quicky lube oil change place. They all will recycle your oil. Don't dump this in a storm drain, don't dump it in the ditch outside your house because it has a really bad effect on nature. - It's oil. - It's oil, okay? We don't want to put it in to our.. It's basically gonna go to water. You know wherever you put this, it's gonna find it's way in to water and that's a really bad thing. Next, we're gonna change the air filter on this. We went back to the store where we bought our lawn mowers and they had the parts right there. If you have a different kind of lawn mower, I'd go back to the dealer you bought it from, and pick one up, cause I'm sure they have the parts for it. There's usually a screw, sometimes the air filters just have a little snap cover on them. That comes out like that. Pretty dirty huh? - Yeah. - I got another one. - Woo! Dirtier. - This is what we pulled out one of our other lawn mowers I just had to show you. So this is just from one season. You pay attention to which way this came out. - Did you? - And you put this one, right back in. I did, yes. It goes in. - Just slides in? - Yep. Alright, we drained the oil, we want to put new oil back in. This is a 30 weight oil. In the instructions for your lawn mower, it'll tell you what kind of oil to use. Generally a straight 30 is used for, I think its above 50 degree weather. Again, this does not take much oil, so be careful here. If you're not comfortable just pouring this in, you can use a plastic funnel, or you can make a funnel out of paper. - Scrap paper. - Yeah. Fold this in to a funnel. Take some tape. (laughing) Cool huh? - Yeah. - Nice huh? You can buy premeasured oil for your engine. These engines don't take more than a pint, and it's really important not to over fill your engine because if you over fill it, bad things can happen just as much as you under filling the engine. - Like what? - The oil washes down the cylinder wall, and it starts to wear out the thing and you start blowing smoke. It's just touching the bottom, so that's good. So I'm just gonna put a little more in. (fly buzzing) (dog chomping) Next, we're gonna change out the spark plug. You can, the best thing to do, is take out the spark plug, and go to the lawn mower supply store and bring it with you. This is a spark plug wrench. That's kind of a burnt up spark plug. You have your new one. So here's the old one, here's the new one. Take this. Don't use the wrench to put this in initially. Finger tight on the spark plug, take your spark plug wrench. - Does it have to be a spark plug wrench? - This is Eric the Car Mechanic but they make really simple ones that you can buy, they're inexpensive and they'll fit a lot more sockets, I mean a lot more spark plugs. We go, tight, and just a little more. But that's it, don't over tighten your spark plug in there, or you're gonna have some problems. You might strip out the threads, or you might not be able to get the spark plug back out back out again, which is a bad thing. - You sound like you know from experience. - Yeah. This is also a really key thing here, to make sure the thing starts again, connect this wire back again. Take the spark plug wire, put that back on again. - If you don't do that it won't start? - Yeah, I learned that more than once (chuckles) Last thing you want to do is part of your tune up and your ongoing maintenance, is to use a gas stabilizer in the fuel that you're gonna put in your lawn mowers. Any small engines, anything with a carburetor basically that you use around the yard. The gas stabilizer makes the engine last longer, it helps the carburetor work better, and there's something with the ethanol that they're mixing in with the fuel these days, that just isn't good for small engines. This stuff really helps. Also, what's really great is, since you're using this, when you put your mowers away for the winter, in the spring time they start right back up again. So this one, our other mower, I pulled out the other day, first pull, they both started. - Yay! - After a whole winter up here. So gas stabilizer in your small engine gas. - How often? - Every time you put gas in here, you put this in. This stuff basically, you can have a five gallon gas can, and you pour in a measured amount of this, in to that gas and you use that for your small engine. - So you don't have to put it in separately. - Nope. - Cool. - Okay, so we've changed our air filter, we changed the spark plug, we changed the oil, and we put gas stabilizer in our fuel, and we're ready to mow. (lawn mower running) - Whee! - That's a beautiful thing. So there you go. More cool stuff on our site, www.gardenfork.tv we also have a video on there about how to sharpen your lawn mower blades because that's the other key to getting a really good lawn. I think you should sharpen the mower blades more often than you probably do, so big hint there. But, cool stuff on our site, www.gardenfork.tv The Video Show, and our Garden Fork Radio Show and Real World Green are all there. You can also watch all these three on iTunes, and on YouTube and let us know, send me an email eric@gardenfork.tv Alright? Make it a great day. (dog panting) (light music) "
Vid73,DIY Rolling Storage Shelves - GardenFork,"- Hey everyone, welcome to GardenFork. We're in the basement. I've been charged with organizing my basement. And I wanted to show you a cool way to make your shelves movable. Often, I have a lot of tools and stuff that I just want to move them all at once. So, I bought some inexpensive shelving and I put some wheels on it. And I wanted to show you how I did that. I think we call it a shelving hack. Okay, let me show you how I did this. This is your regular, old plastic shelves, right. - [Cameraperson] Does everybody have, whoa, look how lightweight those things are. - They're really lightweight, they just kinda go together. You buy them at your home improvement store. And I built, I had some wheels leftover from a project. People throw this kind of thing out. And I just put some pieces of wood. I used a hole saw to cut holes that correspond with the bottoms of the shelf here. So if you see here, the bottoms of this shelving unit have holes. So I just drilled holes here. This is a hole saw. It's actually a big drill bit, but it's called a hole saw. You can buy a set of these inexpensively. Don't buy the really cheap ones. Buy the medium ones. And you can drill into wood and cut big holes. This hole here lines up with this hole here. Like, well, in a perfect world, it works out pretty good. And then I had a spare piece of metal stud. You can just use a scrap piece of wood as a stability. (light jazz) If you're going to have heavier items on your rolling shelves, use two crosspieces instead of one. There you go.

Vid75,Basic Sewing Machine Pants Repair - GardenFork,"- Hey everyone, welcome to GardenFork. Today, how to run a sewing machine or how to repair your pants. Believe it or not I actually know how to run a sewing machine thanks to my mom. - [Woman] (laughs) They would rather not sew. They would rather go for walks. - They wanna go outside, it's pouring rain. But my mother in law gave us a really cool sewing machine and I thought, well, I'm gonna fix my pants because my pants have some huge holes in them. My point here is that sewing machines are expensive new but you might find one at a garage sale or a tag sale. This one is really super nice in that this thing, comes out. - [Woman] I bet all these things have names for them. - So this arm makes it really easy to fix pants and sleeves. So the first thing you wanna do is you have to make a patch to go over the big hole in your pants. (laughs) And the way to do that is you have to have a sacrificial pair of pants that are beyond repair and I wear black Carhartts, right. - [Woman] You think they noticed? - Yeah, so, I took a, I have my Carhartts that are no longer wearable. I cut a piece out and I made a rectangle and I hemmed it here, folded over the cloth and then sewed it here. Okay so this is our patch. And that will be the outside of the patch. All right you have your patch. This is where the patch is gonna be on the outside of your pants. And then you are using some little pins to hold this in place to do the sewing. Now the trick here is you wanna attach your patch to your pants but not the back of the pants. Okay, so I usually put my hand inside and push the cloth up. - [Woman] And not stick yourself. - Right, don't stick yourself. You want this as flat as possible. - [Woman] And that's pretty thick material right. - Yup, but there you go, you just wanna hold it in place and then we're gonna sew it. All right we got it pinned and notice I've got the pinheads on the inside because I'm gonna run the thread, the sewing machine, right around the edge here. And the sewing machine can run over the needle, the pin part, it can't run over the pinhead. Hopefully your machine comes with an instruction manual because they're really, this is kind of like the 3D printer of its era. It's an amazing machine. It does all sorts of stuff and I read the book a couple times with these really detailed things about how to thread it. If all of a sudden it stops sewing, like the needle goes up an down and stops sewing. I found if you re-thread the thing, it seems to solve whatever problem it was. All right, ready to sew? - [Woman] Who sews the pants in this family? - I do. (laughs) If all else fails, read the directions, okay. Actually you should just read the directions first, very un-GardenFork like, but read the instructions. We'll put the foot down and go forward. - [Woman] And do you have a gas pedal? - Yup, press the reverse button. You want to go back and forth a couple times when you first start. - [Woman] To reinforce? - [Eric] So it doesn't un-spool, and then I run this right along the edge and try to keep this as flat as possible. Okay well, we're going to turn, you can adjust the needle, you want the needle in the cloth and then lift up the foot and then turn, now this is kind of difficult because you're dealing with a pant leg. And again, these are work pants, it doesn't have to be perfect but pants are expensive and if you can fix the knees and you get another season out of them then what the heck, okay. The foot goes back down again, and then we work on the next side of the patch. - [Woman] Now it's looking easy. - [Eric] It's a lot of wrestling with the cloth. You want to keep this all flat, because if it bunches up and you sow it it's going to look weird. - [Woman] You've done a couple of these already haven't you? - Yeah I repaired quite a few pairs of my pants, it just saves you money you know. And we had a sowing machine so. The hardest part is navigating your pant leg around the thing and not sowing your pant leg. - [Woman] Together? - [Eric] Together. - [Woman] (laugh) Have you done that? - [Eric] Oops. - [Woman] Have you sewn your finger yet? - [Eric] No. - [Woman] That's good. - [Eric] Alright, this isn't going to be perfect but it will be done. So I hit the reverse button, like that. Pull the thread up. - [Woman] That seems smart. - [Eric] Cut your thread, like that. - [Woman] So you didn't have to put a knot in it, that was the knot? - That is the knot, when you do the reversing a couple of times. Okay, we've reoriented the pant leg on the machine, so I can do the last side of this thing. So again we're going to start, we're going to go forward. Hit the reverse button, and then go forward again. And just run this up, you want to keep this as flat as we can because it bunches up when you sew it it looks weird when you wear your pants. Learn from me. - [Woman] You wouldn't want that, would you? Are you going to put some paint on that patch or something so it looks normal? - Oh, it will get paint on it. Alright so we're going to cross the other thread we did, hit reverse. - [Woman] What does that mean? Shall we pause for commercial break? - I sewed the bottom of the pants in here. One minute. You like the rain? Would you like this? - [Woman] Reverse. - Alright there you go. There's a lot to this but if you just learn by doing, just follow my guide, I just wanted to kind of put the idea in your head to go pull out that sewing machine and fix your pants. - [Woman] On a rainy day. - Yeah, it's raining what else are we going to do? - [Woman] What else are we going to do ? - Throw the tennis ball. Alright if you like what we're doing here we do this every week, you can hit the subscribe button. A question? - [Woman] Yeah, when do you take the pins out? - Oh, now you just. Do that that before you put your pants on. But if you want to hit the subscribe button, also hit the share and like and thumbs up buttons below here. - [Woman] Good thing its black on black. - Share us with your friends. - [Woman] With black thread. - And sign up for our email newsletter. And also check out our iTunes show, our iTunes podcast GardenFork radio. Not bad huh, it's good for work pants, they'll work. These pants are expensive so what the heck. - [Woman] We're going to see these in the next show. - We are, bye, see you later. - [Woman] Can you autograph those. "
Vid76,Split Wood with an Axe - GardenFork,"- Today on Garden Fork how to split wood. (loud crack) (soft music) Hey everyone welcome to Garden Fork, I think that's what it's called. Today I'm going to show you how to hand split fire wood. We also have a video about using a Hydraulic splitter to split fire wood, but there's also, if you just feel like getting some exercise outdoors you can split wood by hand. Ready? (Dogs panting) This is a bunch of Birch from a Birch tree dropped last year I've cut it in to, what I call a fire place length. It's a width that fits in our fire place nicely. - [Woman] (Laughing) - And then I let it dry for a year. It's much easier to split, I think, after a year. This is how I split wood other people may do it differently but just wanted to show ya an outdoor activity. It's kinda cathartic to swing an ax. So. - [Woman] So when you say it's been drying for a year, what do you mean by that? - Well we cut this down last fall and then we stacked it in our wood shed here to dry. In other words, wood that is wet or green has a lot of sap in it. It's difficult to split and it won't burn either in your fire place. You have to let it season. It's called seasoning the wood as well. - [Woman] Ah - So you see here how this has cracks in it now - [Woman] Yeah - That's signs that it has been drying - [Woman] Dehydrated - There you go A couple of tricks here. I always split the wood upside down. You can generally get a feel for which way the tree was pointing. With one of these. And were going to do is turn it upside down to split it. - [Woman] Hey how do you know? I don't know. - I just have a feel for wood. - [Woman] (laughing) - I'm the wood talker It's easiest, I think, to split wood when the ground is frozen. Because you're slamming wood in to the ground. I always put a big piece of wood down here. (metal ringing) When you're splitting wood you're going to be throwing an ax in to your wood and the goal here is not to go into the center of the wood but into the edge like that. - [Woman] Is the center the hardest part? - It's uh yes. And it's also easier, I've found, that when you split wood to split landing in to the edge, rather than the center. Kay? Throw the ball, split wood, throw the ball, split wood - [Woman] I guess they should be far away from you while you're doing the actual, whatever. - Swinging of the ax. - [Woman] Swinging of the ax. - Yeah throw the ball throw the ax. If you're right handed the back of the ax is in your left hand here. Okay? And then you put the ax here and you step back about like this. Because what you're going to be doing you're going to be throwing the ax like this. Okay? It's going to take practice. You're going to miss a couple times. But you're hand is at the back of the ax here. I always, it's kinda like, when you're teeing up to hit a golf ball. Or perhaps coming up to the baseball diamond, the home plate - [Woman] You tap tap - Okay? - [Woman] Yeah - And I'm always like this and then I'm going to take a step in like this. (loud crack) Alright so I got in to the edge here. Right? - [Woman] Yeah - I'd like to be a little farther in so I'm going to redo this. Just put your hand on here, your foot on there and work this back out. (loud crack) Ow. Well that's less than perfect. So what you do here is you take and twist your ax like that. (cracking) and you've split - [Woman] Oh. - Part of it. Not the most beautiful split. Lets do that again okay? (loud crack) last split (loud crack) Oh, alright, so this is an example where you don't quite go all the way through. So we have our sledge hammer here, and we take this. (metal ringing) (cracking) there you go. (thud) This is a larger one so I want to show you how to use an ax and a wedge. okay? (loud crack) Okay now we're in the center of this log. - [Woman] Yeah. - And I'm going to drive this in. (metal ringing) - [Woman] Okay - If your ax gets stuck in here. Get a steal wedge, these are inexpensive and this can supplement the split. The beauty of this is that (metal ringing) it helps split it even more. (metal ringing) - [Woman] Wow! - There you go. So again these are inexpensive, nice to have. - [Woman] You're an regular pioneer. (loud crack) - And then we can split it in to quarters if you want to make it smaller. (loud crack) (upbeat music) (dog collar jingling) (splashing) (loud crack) (loud crack) (loud crack) (loud crack) ( upbeat music) (dog collar jingling) (thump) (loud crack) (loud crack) (cracking) (metal ringing) (thump) (metal ringing) (thump) (loud crack) (loud crack) (loud crack) (upbeat music) - Alright there you go how to split wood, Hand ax, we have another video about how to use a log splitter which is a lot of fun.

Vid78,"Homemade Cards, DIY Block Printing, Paper Crafting - GardenFork",all over the garden park today I'm here my friend Jessica who I recently met she is crafter extraordinaire and we got the talking and she mentioned that she does this thing called block printing which I used to do as a kid and this light bulb went off in my head and I said we need to do a garden part bit about this so Jessica lives up the road for me here in Brooklyn and she came down Brian's here on the camera and she's gonna show us about block printing but I really like about this is that it's a great kid project you can make the Christmas car at a holiday cover to Thanksgiving card low tech analog doesn't involve an inkjet printer doesn't involve a computer it's so analog it's very low five DIY and I have taught this to kids and adults and kids and helps together so it's a great family project and its really cheap everything we're gonna use all together it's like no more than 30 bucks and that's if you use the highest end of everything we're talking about who needs to buy holiday cards I'm going to show you how to make your own yeah this is a carving tool and the cool thing about it is that you can switch out the carving tips by screwing it open sort of lefty loosy there and you just fit the carving end in and tighten it up and then you're ready to go and in the back end here I've got a variety of tips so I can almost like a 6 in 1 screwdriver except it's a carving tool that's what are your favorite tools yeah she watches the show i watch the show here's an example of something that I've made this is the logo from my website that I was working on as you can see it's a pretty big piece of easy carve and what I've done is I have reversed the letters which is important because when you're printing you know this has to be a mirror image of what you want to see on the paper so happy go crafty calm is Jessica's website and I love that we've done this analog logo for a completely digital site right so I'm thinking what I'll do is like take a picture of it and upload it to my website so it's really a great blend of like here's what I can make with my hands usually I can do with a computer so I found online when I googled abstract Christmas tree so you can google that this like swoopy design here which I really like so I also think it'd be really easy to carve so that is one way to do it just a draw right on there and what we'll do is we'll carve away all the pencil lines the other way is to actually do like a transistor to do a transfer yeah so I'm gonna draw a different tree here it's a very basic the erequest tree yeah I mean I drew that and third great I'm pretty sure so there it is in graphite or whatever paper pencils are made out of right now and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna flip it over touch my tree here on this stick it in the middle there and then I'm gonna do this scribble technique and that will transfer some of the graphite into the earthing block so there we go why whoa cool yeah so I'm gonna show you the two different methods of like what to carve away the positive image and the negative image but first we have to talk about some safety and carving curving circuitry Carvey safety there are three things that I teach people when it comes to safety the first thing is to use some kind of guard here now this is something you can make really easily something you could make really with some scrap plywood extend your gun exactly so one edge sits on the counter mm-hmm this is gonna lock in on the edge of your table or your work surface and this edge is going to hold the block that's because one of my safety rules is never have your fingers behind the block important safeties are very important the safety tip because there's no safety tip here this is really sharp and it's designed for carving and it will just as soon card your finger as it will cover this material so good we want you to be a little nervous about romance broke rule number one is make shallow cuts across the top rule number two is always carved away from your body right we should never be carving like this and then rule number three kind of goes with that it's never put your fingers in front of the tool so always have your fingers back here and if you need to move the the block you can if you were gonna carve a circle you could just spin the block like that instead of spinning the tool so I'm making really shallow cuts and I'm not worrying about the background right now I'm just carving out so you're going along the pencil lines you're going on the outside of the pencil lines yeah in this we want to leave the pencil and carve away everything else so what I've done is I finished carving out all the directional lines around my abstract tree but I've still got this star and the star has a lot of detail which is too much detail for this this tip that I'm using here this is my my wider tip so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna change it out and use this smaller tip so the point of the brayer and the plate is to get this as thin as possible to keep going up and down oh yeah so I'm just gonna roll lightly oh I love my background lines actually so we've got this nice thin layer of ink on here and I'm gonna test it on this scrap paper always test it before you put on your real card and I'm gonna press evenly with my fingertips your palm can't feel pressure as well as your fingertips can so don't push so hard that it scoots on the paper you just want it affixed peel it up cool there's your print so I want to show one more really quick and easy method of carving out that's actually even faster than this if this feels like too much for you you're gonna love the other way the Eric method instead of carving everything away from the pencil lines this time we're just gonna carve the actual pencil lines so check this out and this time I'm just cutting out anything that's in pencil so I'm gonna have a following the pencil lines with your little pencil this is the easiest thing to do it's the fastest thing to do now this means anything I carve away is gonna stay white and anything I don't carve away all that surface is gonna be green so it's sort of like a birthday it's gonna look awesome so I think this is just utterly charming let's print it and see what it does I'm gonna aim for a straight placement down I'm gonna touch the tops the bottoms the inside the middles Merry Christmas isn't that sweet so Eric is going to print not only his first card on his first printing ever so no uh no test runs no I'm not gonna do any test run we're just going to do it because the happy accident is the beauty of garden fork okay so I have some cardstock here and I have my design here which I want to show you until I print it oh boy so I like I don't press down oh no I am seeing that is that okay okay and now go the opposite direction - oh yeah then make sure your car is oriented right this is going to be a vertical card okay mm-hmm and I put this roughly in the center and the bigger the stamp is the more you have to make sure that you're pressing all of the areas and I'm using my fingers not my palm next time it's water-based ink so you can get it on your hands and it's okay mm-hmm and this doesn't above a computer or a printer or anything and just remember that now that there's ink on your hands careful where you touch on your paper on the card yeah now I'm ready to pull it up let's see that is awesome except it says that's a beautiful card except it's backwards Oh like card the hoho the right way and I should have carved the hoho backwards but that's the back but this is you send this and people will pay attention you send the digital printed card people are like oh yeah yeah you and your kids make this family

Vid79,DIY Radiator Valve Replacement - GardenFork,"(clunking metal) - [Brian] This you're gonna use somewhere else, right? - This is my life. (lively music) Today we're gonna replace a radiator steam valve and the radiator itself. First, I need coffee. (lively music) Today, Brian and I are gonna replace the steam valve. We're also gonna switch out the radiators. We talked about this in a previous video, but this is a giant radiator here, and I'm gonna switch it out with this little radiator that I got at the scrap yard. 'Cause this hallway area here is just really small, so my helper is complaining about the pipe wrench size. - [Brian] It's a little big, okay. Maybe a little overkill. Less is more. - Basically this is a video about how to replace steam valves, in case you're wondering, and also we're gonna switch out the radiator. So step one, is you need a big pipe wrench on the nut that connects the valve to the radiator. You need a lot of leverage to make this work. (metal clunking) That works very nicely. I like how I run the camera and you do the work for my videos. - [Brian] I wonder about this. (metal squeaking) - [Narrator] All right, that's the easiest part of this job, is removing that. - [Brian] Well, it's not always easy, though. - [Narrator] No, it's not. - [Brian] A 100 year old. - [Narrator] Hand truck. - [Brian] Yeah, they're very heavy. - [Narrator] This is the valve I want to take the valve off. So Brian is going to do that, while I hold the camera. - [Brian] I'm not sure if I can. - [Narrator] Yes we can. - [Brian] Yeah. - [Narrator] So we've got the back pipe. We've got the supply pipe braced by that one pipe wrench which is on the ground. We have another large pipe wrench here. - [Brian] It's actually working. - [Narrator] Yeah, that's a three foot pipe wrench which makes our lives much easier. This is a cheater pipe. If you have a smaller wrench, you can increase the leverage of a small pipe of the wrench by putting a piece of spare pipe on your wrench. (pipe sliding) That turns that very nicely. (brushing) Put the new valve on. Nice, lined up to where the radiator is gonna be. Now we have to remove the old parts and put in this new part, into the radiator. This is very difficult to get out, so what we're gonna do actually is cut it and break it out. (sawing) (metallic hammering) At a certain point it just collapses in. There you go. That's why we cut like that. (metal clinking) That's called a spud, and that'll put in the new one. (metal clanging) So we're gonna walk that over to there. - [Brian] Hah, not the same height. So, in theory, we should be able to just bend this up. - [Narrator] So we ran to the store and got a three foot cheater pipe. Put this up. There you go. Put the valve back on. Let's see if it lines up with the radiator. This is going to be perfect. I'm telling you Brian, that's pointing the wrong way. - [Brian] I know, I know. - [Narrator] So this floor is not level at all, so we're using wedges and we want the radiator to have a slight pitch towards the valve and the riser pipe. You're very good at that Brian. - I'm just fooling everybody. (metal clanking) - [Narrator] So there's a compression fitting. We're tightening that up. You don't put any paste on that fitting. - [Brian] That's about it. - [Narrator] Nice. - [Brian] I wanna make sure it's open. - [Narrator] What do you think? Was it good? I think it's beautiful. All right, I think I need to just change that pitch a little bit. It's a little severe. But, the Labradors approve. Feel a little bit more even heat distribution here, so thanks for watching.
