[CLS] but now the challenge here is to stain these doors . [SEP] [CLS] and it ' ##s a little complicated by the fact that these are pine doors , and this is oak trim . [SEP] [CLS] and we went with the pine doors , really for budget reasons . [SEP] [CLS] oak doors are wicked expensive . [SEP] [CLS] but now we wan na stain them , and i wan na show you guys how i do wood stain ##ing . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m pretty much novice wood stain ##er , but again it was an opportunity to show you guys how to do something , and the best way to do that is by doing it . [SEP] [CLS] you do n ##' ##t wan na stain these in place , because people are living here . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re go ##n na take these into the shop , and stain them there . [SEP] [CLS] alright , here we go . [SEP] [CLS] ( upbeat music ) stain ##ing wood is not hard , but what ' ##s key is the prep . [SEP] [CLS] and i ' ##m not one for details , and this is very detail oriented , but i ' ##m go ##n na make it happen , and i ' ##m go ##n na show you guys how you can do it too . [SEP] [CLS] couple of key things you need . [SEP] [CLS] first of all , the stain ingredients , i call them . [SEP] [CLS] if you ' ##re go ##n na be using pine , or a soft wood , you need a pre stain condition ##er . [SEP] [CLS] i skipped this the first time i did it , and i paid the price . [SEP] [CLS] the stain is really b ##lot ##chy , on pine and soft woods , if you do n ##' ##t use this first . [SEP] [CLS] you want the stain itself . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##ll go into this more as we ' ##re applying it . [SEP] [CLS] and then , a poly ##ure ##than ##e . [SEP] [CLS] this will go on a couple days later , after the stain is dried . [SEP] [CLS] to prepare this , we ' ##re going to use a 220 grit sand ##paper . [SEP] [CLS] this is this new sand ##paper i just got at the store . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s like sand ##paper on a flexible film . [SEP] [CLS] be really good for getting around the corners and stuff here . [SEP] [CLS] some gloves , always good . [SEP] [CLS] some blue tape is handy to have . [SEP] [CLS] these are called tack cloth ##s . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s cheese ##cloth ##s that is imp ##re ##gna ##ted with i think bees ##wa ##x . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s for pulling up the saw
[CLS] today i ' ##m go ##n na show you how to hang and ike ##a kitchen cabinet . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re doing a kitchen here , renovation . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##ve done a couple other ike ##a cabinet videos , building counter ##tops and stuff . [SEP] [CLS] and i wan na show you how to put this up . [SEP] [CLS] first , if all else fails , read instructions to assemble the cabinet . [SEP] [CLS] ike ##a works on a rail system . [SEP] [CLS] you put this rail on the wall . [SEP] [CLS] then all the cabinets hang from the rail . [SEP] [CLS] bolt goes through here , connects to here , goes on the wall , okay . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re go ##n na be putting this on a brick wall if you ' ##re using this on a dry ##wall wall , use a stud find ##er to find the stud ##s . [SEP] [CLS] you wan na hang this really in a strong place . [SEP] [CLS] [ brian ] what ' ##s the name of that cabinet ? [SEP] [CLS] no , it ' ##s called the ak ##uru ##m . [SEP] [CLS] the ike ##a people are go ##n na tell us how to say that word . [SEP] [CLS] but we got more ike ##a videos coming your way here . [SEP] [CLS] here we go , this wall . [SEP] [CLS] this is going up there . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ll show you how to do it , okay . [SEP] [CLS] you want this bracket to be slightly shorter than the total width of all your cabinets . [SEP] [CLS] ' ##ca ##use you do n ##' ##t want this metal bracket to stick out the end . [SEP] [CLS] so i cut this a little shorter than the cabinet you ' ##re go ##n na find the height ##h with a friend of yours where you want the cabinet to be . [SEP] [CLS] you ' ##re going to mark the top and then measure down because this bracket sits just below the cabinet . [SEP] [CLS] now we ' ##re go ##n na drill some holes to hold this up , okay . [SEP] [CLS] [ brian ] are you go ##n na be welding that on ? [SEP] [CLS] you should always have on the proper safety equipment and then your glasses . [SEP] [CLS] or if you wan na wear your star trek outfit when you ' ##re on youtube . [SEP] [CLS] we also have a video about how to drill into cement and concrete and how to hang shelves and things . [SEP] [CLS] but real quick we ' ##re just go ##n na use this . [SEP] [CLS] always have safety equipment on . [SEP] [CLS] the best way to go into a brick or cement is a hammer drill ,
[CLS] today on garden fork how to split wood . [SEP] [CLS] ( loud crack ) ( soft music ) hey everyone welcome to garden fork , i think that ' ##s what it ' ##s called . [SEP] [CLS] today i ' ##m going to show you how to hand split fire wood . [SEP] [CLS] we also have a video about using a hydraulic split ##ter to split fire wood , but there ' ##s also , if you just feel like getting some exercise outdoors you can split wood by hand . [SEP] [CLS] ( dogs panting ) this is a bunch of birch from a birch tree dropped last year i ' ##ve cut it in to , what i call a fire place length . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s a width that fits in our fire place nicely . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] ( laughing ) and then i let it dry for a year . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s much easier to split , i think , after a year . [SEP] [CLS] this is how i split wood other people may do it differently but just wanted to show ya an outdoor activity . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s kinda cat ##hart ##ic to swing an ax . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] so when you say it ' ##s been drying for a year , what do you mean by that ? [SEP] [CLS] well we cut this down last fall and then we stacked it in our wood shed here to dry . [SEP] [CLS] in other words , wood that is wet or green has a lot of sap in it . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s difficult to split and it wo n ##' ##t burn either in your fire place . [SEP] [CLS] you have to let it season . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s called season ##ing the wood as well . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] ah so you see here how this has cracks in it now [ woman ] yeah that ' ##s signs that it has been drying [ woman ] de ##hy ##dra ##ted there you go a couple of tricks here . [SEP] [CLS] i always split the wood upside down . [SEP] [CLS] you can generally get a feel for which way the tree was pointing . [SEP] [CLS] and were going to do is turn it upside down to split it . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] hey how do you know ? [SEP] [CLS] i just have a feel for wood . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] ( laughing ) i ' ##m the wood talk ##er it ' ##s easiest , i think , to split wood when the ground is frozen . [SEP] [CLS] because you ' ##re slamming wood in to the ground . [SEP] [CLS] i always put a big piece of wood down here . [SEP] [CLS] ( metal ringing
[CLS] hey everyone , welcome to garden ##for ##k . [SEP] [CLS] today , how to run a sewing machine or how to repair your pants . [SEP] [CLS] believe it or not i actually know how to run a sewing machine thanks to my mom . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] ( laughs ) they would rather not se ##w . [SEP] [CLS] they would rather go for walks . [SEP] [CLS] they wan na go outside , it ' ##s pouring rain . [SEP] [CLS] but my mother in law gave us a really cool sewing machine and i thought , well , i ' ##m go ##n na fix my pants because my pants have some huge holes in them . [SEP] [CLS] my point here is that sewing machines are expensive new but you might find one at a garage sale or a tag sale . [SEP] [CLS] this one is really super nice in that this thing , comes out . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] i bet all these things have names for them . [SEP] [CLS] so this arm makes it really easy to fix pants and sleeves . [SEP] [CLS] so the first thing you wan na do is you have to make a patch to go over the big hole in your pants . [SEP] [CLS] ( laughs ) and the way to do that is you have to have a sac ##ri ##fi ##cial pair of pants that are beyond repair and i wear black car ##hart ##ts , right . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] you think they noticed ? [SEP] [CLS] yeah , so , i took a , i have my car ##hart ##ts that are no longer wear ##able . [SEP] [CLS] i cut a piece out and i made a rec ##tangle and i hem ##med it here , folded over the cloth and then se ##wed it here . [SEP] [CLS] okay so this is our patch . [SEP] [CLS] and that will be the outside of the patch . [SEP] [CLS] all right you have your patch . [SEP] [CLS] this is where the patch is go ##n na be on the outside of your pants . [SEP] [CLS] and then you are using some little pins to hold this in place to do the sewing . [SEP] [CLS] now the trick here is you wan na attach your patch to your pants but not the back of the pants . [SEP] [CLS] okay , so i usually put my hand inside and push the cloth up . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] and not stick yourself . [SEP] [CLS] right , do n ##' ##t stick yourself . [SEP] [CLS] you want this as flat as possible . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] and that ' ##s pretty thick material right . [SEP] [CLS] yu ##p , but there you go , you just wan na hold it in place and then
[CLS] hey everyone , welcome to garden ##for ##k . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re in the basement . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ve been charged with organizing my basement . [SEP] [CLS] and i wanted to show you a cool way to make your shelves mo ##vable . [SEP] [CLS] often , i have a lot of tools and stuff that i just want to move them all at once . [SEP] [CLS] so , i bought some inexpensive she ##lving and i put some wheels on it . [SEP] [CLS] and i wanted to show you how i did that . [SEP] [CLS] i think we call it a she ##lving hack . [SEP] [CLS] okay , let me show you how i did this . [SEP] [CLS] this is your regular , old plastic shelves , right . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera ##person ] does everybody have , whoa , look how lightweight those things are . [SEP] [CLS] they ' ##re really lightweight , they just kinda go together . [SEP] [CLS] you buy them at your home improvement store . [SEP] [CLS] and i built , i had some wheels left ##over from a project . [SEP] [CLS] people throw this kind of thing out . [SEP] [CLS] and i just put some pieces of wood . [SEP] [CLS] i used a hole saw to cut holes that correspond with the bottoms of the shelf here . [SEP] [CLS] so if you see here , the bottoms of this she ##lving unit have holes . [SEP] [CLS] so i just drilled holes here . [SEP] [CLS] this is a hole saw . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s actually a big drill bit , but it ' ##s called a hole saw . [SEP] [CLS] you can buy a set of these inexpensive ##ly . [SEP] [CLS] do n ##' ##t buy the really cheap ones . [SEP] [CLS] and you can drill into wood and cut big holes . [SEP] [CLS] this hole here lines up with this hole here . [SEP] [CLS] like , well , in a perfect world , it works out pretty good . [SEP] [CLS] and then i had a spare piece of metal stud . [SEP] [CLS] you can just use a scrap piece of wood as a stability . [SEP] [CLS] ( light jazz ) if you ' ##re going to have heavier items on your rolling shelves , use two cross ##piece ##s instead of one . [SEP] [CLS] if you like more of this kind of thing , we put out shows every week , please sub ##scribe . [SEP] [CLS] hit the like button if you like what we ' ##re doing here . [SEP] [CLS] ah , bite my hand . [SEP] [CLS] ( laughing ) and do n ##' ##t forget about our email newsletter . [SEP] [CLS] the sign ##up is in the section below here . [SEP] [CLS] just click on
[CLS] ( leaves rustling ) hey everyone . [SEP] [CLS] today , build a com ##post bin out of wood pal ##lets . [SEP] [CLS] super easy , free wood , big bin . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera operator ] o ##oo ##wee ! [SEP] [CLS] these guys are obsessed with the tennis ball . [SEP] [CLS] they love the cold weather and i ' ##m go ##n na have to throw the ball the whole time we ' ##re building this thing . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera operator ] you must be exhausted . [SEP] [CLS] because they know when we whip out the camera it ' ##s time to play ball . [SEP] [CLS] ( laughing ) ( leaves rustling ) all right , four pal ##lets . [SEP] [CLS] you can find them probably at a hardware store or big box store . [SEP] [CLS] just ask them hey , do you have any pal ##lets ? [SEP] [CLS] and they ' ##re go ##n na say , oh yeah out in the back , go have some . [SEP] [CLS] they might need the pal ##let for something . [SEP] [CLS] but , sometimes they ' ##re recycling , but if they ' ##re throwing them out , go get them , all right ? [SEP] [CLS] [ camera operator ] is that made out of a particular kind of wood ? [SEP] [CLS] uh , i do n ##' ##t know . [SEP] [CLS] a lot of times it looks like they ' ##re made out of oak or pop ##lar or whatever they have . [SEP] [CLS] save the nice ##st looking one for the front of the bin . [SEP] [CLS] this is the nice ##st looking one , so we are going to set this one aside . [SEP] [CLS] so what we ' ##re go ##n na do is we ' ##re go ##n na build a box out of pal ##lets . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s go ##n na be a tall box . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s go ##n na be a little off level because we ' ##re on a sl ##op here but that ' ##s the way it is . [SEP] [CLS] so first , we ' ##re just go ##n na tie these together lightly and we ' ##re just go ##n na put some screw ##s in through the pal ##lets here from the side pal ##let to the end back pal ##let . [SEP] [CLS] ( drilling ) just to hold it there so we can work on it . [SEP] [CLS] then we ' ##re go ##n na make a little stronger connection with some shelf brackets i found off the street . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera operator ] you ' ##re very economical . [SEP] [CLS] well , people throwing them out , and i was like , oh yeah let ' ##s use them . [SEP] [CLS] all
[CLS] ( smooth music ) he ' ##s busy . [SEP] [CLS] today , we ' ##re going to put in a bathroom fa ##uce ##t . [SEP] [CLS] the pup ##s are going to help . [SEP] [CLS] ours we ' ##re going to have to do a little bit of extra work on because it ' ##s very old . [SEP] [CLS] but i just want to show you if you want to replace the fa ##uce ##t , is it leaking or something . [SEP] [CLS] you can do this is your kitchen or your bathroom , your utility room , or wherever you want to go . [SEP] [CLS] as long as you have a milk jug . [SEP] [CLS] this is a very inexpensive play toy for pup ##pies that they like . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s a milk jug . [SEP] [CLS] you just give it to them , and they go . [SEP] [CLS] do you know have your mr ##. ##ma ##go ##o glasses on ? [SEP] [CLS] yeah , i got my mr ##. ##ma ##go ##o glasses on because i need to see close up today . [SEP] [CLS] usually , underneath your sink , you already have these turn ##off valves like this . [SEP] [CLS] in our house , we do n ##' ##t have them . [SEP] [CLS] so we have to put these on first . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re going to have to de sold ##er this joint right here . [SEP] [CLS] then we ' ##re going to put on a fitting , and then i ' ##m going to put these on here . [SEP] [CLS] what ' ##s up with the tin foil ? [SEP] [CLS] that ' ##s not usually in our bathroom . [SEP] [CLS] no , but the tin foil is here to protect the paint . [SEP] [CLS] because we ' ##re going to be using a prop ##ane torch fairly close to the wall . [SEP] [CLS] you should have your fire ex ##ting ##uis ##her close by . [SEP] [CLS] if you do n ##' ##t feel comfortable doing this , perhaps you should have a professional do this , alright . [SEP] [CLS] this is not part of the official how to , this is just eric doing it . [SEP] [CLS] because prop ##ane near a wall can start a fire . [SEP] [CLS] should we hire a professional ? [SEP] [CLS] oh you are a professional ! [SEP] [CLS] i am a pro ; no i ' ##m not . [SEP] [CLS] ( laughing ) i ' ##m a master of the obvious . [SEP] [CLS] how ' ##s that going moose ? [SEP] [CLS] ( cr ##ink ##le ) what i forgot to mention is we need to remove these copper pipes that are going up into the fa ##uce ##t . [SEP] [CLS] you want to disco ##nne ##ct

[CLS] ( engine starts ) hey , everyone , welcome to garden fork . [SEP] [CLS] that started on the first pull after sitting for quite a while because i do regular maintenance on the generator . [SEP] [CLS] today i ' ##m go ##n na show you my fall tune ##up that i do . [SEP] [CLS] if i can do it you can do it , today on garden fork . [SEP] [CLS] ( engine shut ##s down ) first thing you wan na do is heat this puppy up because we ' ##re go ##n na change the oil . [SEP] [CLS] so let it run for about ten minutes . [SEP] [CLS] you want the oil to become , what ' ##s the word , vis ##cous ? [SEP] [CLS] move it around , you ' ##re go ##n na try and stir up the sediment at the bottom of the crank case . [SEP] [CLS] and generally warm this puppy up . [SEP] [CLS] then take it in a dry place because it ' ##s raining out here , and we ' ##ll get to work , okay ? [SEP] [CLS] i always like to try and el ##eva ##te this thing before i try and work on it . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s a little bit easier on your knees that way . [SEP] [CLS] first thing we ' ##re go ##n na do is we ' ##re go ##n na drain out the oil , put in a new oil filter , and put in fresh oil . [SEP] [CLS] so we start with that by draining it . [SEP] [CLS] i had a little piece of pipe on here that makes it a lot easier to drain this oil . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ve got a plastic milk cart ##on . [SEP] [CLS] and a funnel to drain this out . [SEP] [CLS] this is go ##n na be hot , so , careful , okay ? [SEP] [CLS] maybe you should wear some gloves . [SEP] [CLS] clean off a little bit of that drip . [SEP] [CLS] i really like this little pipe i added on here . [SEP] [CLS] see how dirty that is ? [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s been running your engine . [SEP] [CLS] to one of those instant car lu ##be oil places or your local garage , and they will rec ##y ##cle this for you . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m pretty sure it ' ##s almost in every state that ' ##s a law . [SEP] [CLS] do n ##' ##t dump this in the yard . [SEP] [CLS] do n ##' ##t dump it in a creek . [SEP] [CLS] do n ##' ##t just throw it in your trash because this is bad stuff if it gets into the dirt . [SEP] [CLS] so we ' ##re go ##n na put new oil in here , but first
[CLS] alright , so you just got your new flat panel tv and you want to put it on your dry ##wall or sheet ##rock wall using one of these tv mounts . [SEP] [CLS] today i ' ##m going to show you how to do that , it ' ##s really easy , even i can do it . [SEP] [CLS] and if i can do it , you can do it . [SEP] [CLS] so , step one is you want to figure out where on the wall you want this to be . [SEP] [CLS] this really helps to have two or maybe three people help you . [SEP] [CLS] you want to figure out roughly where you want it and then using a pencil , a light pencil ideally , you ' ##re going to mark , and i dropped the pencil , hold on . [SEP] [CLS] like i said , this is better with a couple of people . [SEP] [CLS] so , you want to mark with your pencil the outside edges , on both sides . [SEP] [CLS] so , we know in this area here , ideally , we need to find a stud . [SEP] [CLS] and a stud is the two by four , wood two by four , or a metal stud that is behind the sheet ##rock that we can drive into . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m going to show you how to do it into a stud and if you ca n ##' ##t find the stud , what to do . [SEP] [CLS] this is a pretty cool stud find ##er , you can buy a bunch of them at the store . [SEP] [CLS] ( knocking ) i think that there is one here . [SEP] [CLS] ( bee ##ping ) ah , there we go . [SEP] [CLS] you can also sometimes look along , if you have your eye and you shine a light back this way you can see where the wall kind of mounds out a little bit . [SEP] [CLS] where the joint compound went over the joint and that ' ##s where a stud is , as well . [SEP] [CLS] another way you can do it , is , since this is going to be covered by a big tv panel , is you can just drill holes until you hit the stud . [SEP] [CLS] ( drilling ) ( knocking ) what do you think , about right there ? [SEP] [CLS] ( drilling ) it feels like it . [SEP] [CLS] lets get a screw and see . [SEP] [CLS] dry ##wall screw , lets see . [SEP] [CLS] ( drilling ) yeah , that ' ##s a stud . [SEP] [CLS] if it ' ##s not a stud , it does this . [SEP] [CLS] ( drilling ) just spins . [SEP] [CLS] so we ' ##re lucky in that there is a
[CLS] hey everyone , today on garden fork , how to replace a screening on a window or door . [SEP] [CLS] i did n ##' ##t do this . [SEP] [CLS] ( relaxing guitar music ) ( barking ) usually in the summer , this becomes screen door , but somebody blew through it last year . [SEP] [CLS] who broke through the screen door ? [SEP] [CLS] could that be you charlie pup ? [SEP] [CLS] ( barking ) so i ' ##m go ##n na show you today how to fix your screen door cause instead of having to buy a new screen or maybe even a whole new door , you just fix it , like i do , ready ? [SEP] [CLS] here ' ##s what you ' ##re go ##n na need : some screening sp ##line , a sp ##line tool , a really sharp brand new blade utility knife and some screen material . [SEP] [CLS] ideally , you want a big flat works ##pace as big as whatever screen you ' ##re replacing . [SEP] [CLS] use your knife and dig out a piece of the existing sp ##line here and you just pull this out . [SEP] [CLS] and take that to the store and match it to the sp ##line they have , there ' ##s a couple different ... there we go , be better if it looks like that . [SEP] [CLS] there ' ##s a couple different diameter ##s of sp ##line , it ' ##s like rubber ##y string . [SEP] [CLS] well , it ' ##s rubber that ' ##s string like ; rope like , maybe that ' ##s the right word here . [SEP] [CLS] anyway go to the store and get that , get your sp ##line tool and again sharp utility knife . [SEP] [CLS] and then start taking this out . [SEP] [CLS] that comes out and then this comes out very easily . [SEP] [CLS] un ##roll your screen , can be a little tricky . [SEP] [CLS] make sure you have enough . [SEP] [CLS] trim this so there ' ##s some overlap past here . [SEP] [CLS] these are called bulldog cl ##amps , i mean use what you got . [SEP] [CLS] i make sure the screen is overlap ##ped the corner and then i take this and i snap that on like that . [SEP] [CLS] so this is the opposite corner that we just clamped so pull this tight like that and take another cl ##amp slip that on like that . [SEP] [CLS] so i got four corners now , with the little cl ##amps . [SEP] [CLS] now we ' ##re go ##n na use our sp ##line tool . [SEP] [CLS] now on the sp ##line tool there are two ends ; two wheels . [SEP] [CLS] one of them is rounded like this and the other one has a
[CLS] [ eric ] today on garden ##for ##k , some hints and tips on using your brick pizza oven . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera women ] smelling pizza ? [SEP] [CLS] hey everyone , welcome to garden ##for ##k , another one of our pizza videos . [SEP] [CLS] this is outdoor brick pizza oven , hints and tips and tricks , stuff that i ' ##ve learned . [SEP] [CLS] if you ' ##re come across this show , we have an original video about how to build our portable outdoor pizza oven . [SEP] [CLS] links are below , in the about section or at the end of this video . [SEP] [CLS] but i wanted to do another video about stuff we ' ##ve learned , cooking with our outdoor oven and other people have learned . [SEP] [CLS] there ' ##s been a ton of great pictures people have sent in about portable oven ##s that they ' ##ve built , brick oven ##s . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera women ] so improvements ? [SEP] [CLS] um , i do n ##' ##t want to heat up my wine , so . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera women ] you ' ##re about to burn your list . [SEP] [CLS] if you are using used brick , used clay brick , and used clay brick is always in slightly different sizes . [SEP] [CLS] we got a big pile of it and they ' ##re all odd sizes , so , you should group together same sized bricks when you ' ##re building the base , the sides , and the top . [SEP] [CLS] i learned that this time because i was building it and it would n ##' ##t come together . [SEP] [CLS] the front metal bracket , we ' ##re using these angle iron ##s that we recycled . [SEP] [CLS] thee front one goes face down rather than face up . [SEP] [CLS] makes it much easier to put it together . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera women ] what else ? [SEP] [CLS] you want your portable brick oven on a really solid foundation . [SEP] [CLS] if you use cheap saw horses , this is what happens . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera women ] you have a col ##la ##ps ##ible oven . [SEP] [CLS] yeah , we have a col ##la ##ps ##ible oven . [SEP] [CLS] so , we use these ones and it just went fu ##mp , right over . [SEP] [CLS] when you ' ##re firing your oven , do n ##' ##t use green wood . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera women ] it ' ##s actually the color green , too . [SEP] [CLS] yeah , you want the dr ##iest wood possible , this is white oak , red oak , i think , is even better . [SEP] [CLS] and you can use scrap lumber from a project as your kind ##ling
[CLS] ( hammering metal ) are you tired of breaking apart your pal ##let ' ##s like this ? [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] i am . [SEP] [CLS] stay tuned for a new tool on garden fork . [SEP] [CLS] ( light piano music ) first i wan na give credit where credit is due . [SEP] [CLS] i did n ##' ##t in ##vent this . [SEP] [CLS] my design is a modification of two different designs that i found in ins ##truct ##able ##s from rib ##its ##ky and darren , so a big thank you for them for giving me the genesis of the idea . [SEP] [CLS] here ' ##s what i built . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m using angle iron and some black pipe here and i built ... o ##ops . [SEP] [CLS] so , to start out with , i have a piece of 3 ##/ ##4 inch , three foot pipe with a 3 ##/ ##4 inch right angle here and my idea with the right angle was that this would be increased leverage when you ' ##re pry ##ing and then i took an angle bracket here and i laid it about where i thought it should go and i marked it here and then i drill pressed . [SEP] [CLS] i drilled these two holes . [SEP] [CLS] ( light piano music ) ( drilling ) i ' ##m just go ##n na make sure that these are all truly 1 ##/ ##4 here . [SEP] [CLS] ( machinery sounds ) so to assemble this , i ' ##ve got two 1 ##/ ##4 inch , these are grade 5 bolts , which is a little higher quality bolts . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ve got some 1 ##/ ##4 inch ny ##lock nuts and some oversized 3 ##/ ##8 nuts to act as space ##rs , some regular wash ##ers and some smaller bolts here with lock wash ##ers . [SEP] [CLS] lock wash ##ers are the key here for everything . [SEP] [CLS] so our 1 ##/ ##4 inch bolts go through two of the pieces of angle bracket . [SEP] [CLS] [ eric ] and then i slide on two of the oversized 3 ##/ ##8 nuts here , one 3 ##/ ##8 nut here and three wash ##ers . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] so two on one side and one on the other ? [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] oh , okay . [SEP] [CLS] [ eric ] so you space here ... and i put it on backwards ... this should be pointing the back . [SEP] [CLS] ( metal scraping ) ( light piano music ) then we take a lock wash ##er and one of these ny ##lock nuts . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] they ' ##re the key , i remember . [SEP] [CLS] so we ' ##ve got these two brackets on each side and they could
[CLS] to connect some tile , i wanted to share with you this cool tile cutter that i borrowed from my neighbor . [SEP] [CLS] this is a little portable tile cutter . [SEP] [CLS] it has a water reservoir down here . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera person ] oh cool ! [SEP] [CLS] that keeps the saw blade cool . [SEP] [CLS] it has a little handle over here , so you can just carry it around . [SEP] [CLS] and if you ' ##re thinking you have to do a lot of tile work for a project . [SEP] [CLS] instead of rent ##ing a big tile saw with a big bash tray and all that , maybe one of your neighbors has this , or you can buy it or rent it . [SEP] [CLS] but i just want to show you this easy way . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s like cut ##tin ' butter . [SEP] [CLS] i ca n ##' ##t find the mark , hold on . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera person ] your measure mark ? [SEP] [CLS] yeah i might have to measure again . [SEP] [CLS] oh , there it is . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera person ] you have your ear mu ##ffs on ? [SEP] [CLS] i have ear protection on . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s really cold out . [SEP] [CLS] but this works really nicely . [SEP] [CLS] just a simple fence here . [SEP] [CLS] oh , i bumped it . [SEP] [CLS] just lock your fence down . [SEP] [CLS] now when you turn this thing on , the saw blade ' ##s go ##n na whip water at you , okay ? [SEP] [CLS] ( cutting noises ) nice , really simple . [SEP] [CLS] so i just wanted to share with you i avoid tile at all costs , but sometimes i have to cut tile . [SEP] [CLS] all right , more cool stuff . [SEP] [CLS] di ##y garden for it go to sub ##scribe , the sub ##scribe button . [SEP] [CLS] and set up for our email . [SEP] [CLS] i ca n ##' ##t hear because i have the ear protection on . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera person ] ca n ##' ##t speak either ! [SEP] [CLS] no , i ca n ##' ##t . [SEP] [CLS] all right get our email news letter . [SEP] [CLS] the link is below and below , and uh , see ya . [SEP] [CLS] [ camera person ] henry ' ##s waiting for you . [SEP] [CLS] ( laughing ) that ' ##s what you get for barking too much .

[CLS] hey everyone , welcome to garden fork . [SEP] [CLS] today i ' ##m go ##n na give you a tour of my homemade greenhouse behind us here . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##ve had this house well the greenhouse was here when we moved in . [SEP] [CLS] i did some upgrades but i just wanted to show you , if you got a bunch of windows laying around , you could make something like this , right ? [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] ( laughs ) i was preoccupied by that . [SEP] [CLS] ( dogs talking ) alright , let me give you a tour , okay ? [SEP] [CLS] these are these giant windows that were in the garage actually when we bought the house . [SEP] [CLS] you might find these at a junk ##yard or something or maybe someone ' ##s throwing them out . [SEP] [CLS] and then the roof is actually fairly new . [SEP] [CLS] it is a corrugated greenhouse plastic that we bought at one of the home improvement stores . [SEP] [CLS] so , that ' ##s the new thing . [SEP] [CLS] it did have this kind of old style [ woman ] green , it was green . [SEP] [CLS] it was like a faded green roof but a couple of tree limbs went through it and some ice and so we upgraded and got something that ' ##s a little more robust . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] oh , i think this is where you say , we have a video about that . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s a lot of snow . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] you barely put a dent in it . [SEP] [CLS] yeah , well that ' ##s all i can reach but it ' ##ll take some of the weight off . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] you wan na tell them about the ( woman screaming loudly ) ( woman and man laughing ) wow . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] it worked ! [SEP] [CLS] ( woman laughing ) see it ' ##s very simple . [SEP] [CLS] there is a bit of a snow load on here so i ' ##ve upgraded the bracing of our roof here . [SEP] [CLS] so where the greenhouse meets the clap ##board of the house , i put in a big piece of flashing at an angle so water does n ##' ##t get between the greenhouse and the clap ##board and rot that wood . [SEP] [CLS] it hits the metal flashing and then goes onto the roof ##ing of the greenhouse there so , however your house is clad , think about that if you ' ##re attach ##ing your greenhouse to the wall of the house . [SEP] [CLS] i tried to build a new door and it did n ##' ##t work very well . [SEP] [CLS] so this is a [
[CLS] ( cl ##unk ##ing metal ) [ brian ] this you ' ##re go ##n na use somewhere else , right ? [SEP] [CLS] ( lively music ) today we ' ##re go ##n na replace a ra ##dia ##tor steam valve and the ra ##dia ##tor itself . [SEP] [CLS] first , i need coffee . [SEP] [CLS] ( lively music ) today , brian and i are go ##n na replace the steam valve . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re also go ##n na switch out the ra ##dia ##tors . [SEP] [CLS] we talked about this in a previous video , but this is a giant ra ##dia ##tor here , and i ' ##m go ##n na switch it out with this little ra ##dia ##tor that i got at the scrap yard . [SEP] [CLS] ' ##ca ##use this hallway area here is just really small , so my help ##er is complaining about the pipe wren ##ch size . [SEP] [CLS] [ brian ] it ' ##s a little big , okay . [SEP] [CLS] basically this is a video about how to replace steam valves , in case you ' ##re wondering , and also we ' ##re go ##n na switch out the ra ##dia ##tor . [SEP] [CLS] so step one , is you need a big pipe wren ##ch on the nut that connects the valve to the ra ##dia ##tor . [SEP] [CLS] you need a lot of leverage to make this work . [SEP] [CLS] ( metal cl ##unk ##ing ) that works very nicely . [SEP] [CLS] i like how i run the camera and you do the work for my videos . [SEP] [CLS] [ brian ] i wonder about this . [SEP] [CLS] ( metal squeak ##ing ) [ narrator ] all right , that ' ##s the easiest part of this job , is removing that . [SEP] [CLS] [ brian ] well , it ' ##s not always easy , though . [SEP] [CLS] [ narrator ] no , it ' ##s not . [SEP] [CLS] [ brian ] a 100 year old . [SEP] [CLS] [ narrator ] hand truck . [SEP] [CLS] [ brian ] yeah , they ' ##re very heavy . [SEP] [CLS] [ narrator ] this is the valve i want to take the valve off . [SEP] [CLS] so brian is going to do that , while i hold the camera . [SEP] [CLS] [ brian ] i ' ##m not sure if i can . [SEP] [CLS] [ narrator ] yes we can . [SEP] [CLS] [ narrator ] so we ' ##ve got the back pipe . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##ve got the supply pipe braced by that one pipe wren ##ch which is on the ground . [SEP] [CLS] we have another large pipe wren ##ch here . [SEP] [CLS] [ brian ] it ' ##s actually working . [SEP] [CLS] [
[CLS] i hate throwing out tools , especially tools that i think i can probably fix . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re doing a stain ##ing video right now , i ' ##m stain ##ing some pine doors and i made a huge mistake . [SEP] [CLS] here ' ##s our first coat , looks really nice . [SEP] [CLS] then we have a problem . [SEP] [CLS] i do n ##' ##t know what happened here . [SEP] [CLS] there ' ##s a link below to watch that video there . [SEP] [CLS] and i need to sand down one of the doors again , and i was like , well i need my palm sand ##er . [SEP] [CLS] both my palm sanders are broken . [SEP] [CLS] long story , but we were dry wall ##ing a 12 foot high ceiling and one of my team liked to sand down the butt joints with a palm sand ##er , and so he used my sanders and i think i can fix them . [SEP] [CLS] they ' ##re broken now , i think it ' ##s an easy fix , and i thought let ' ##s just show people do n ##' ##t throw out your tools , take them apart , try and fix them . [SEP] [CLS] so today on garden fork , power tool repair . [SEP] [CLS] ( upbeat music ) i picked up a spray can of electronic cleaner . [SEP] [CLS] this stuff ' ##s handy to have around . [SEP] [CLS] and i got a phillips . [SEP] [CLS] these are really deep screw ##s here . [SEP] [CLS] do this on an area that it ' ##s okay to make a mess on . [SEP] [CLS] my counter is perfect for this . [SEP] [CLS] that comes off , put that somewhere safe . [SEP] [CLS] if you look down in here , you can see these are phillips screw ##s , so that works . [SEP] [CLS] sometimes they ' ##re torque ##s , which makes things a little more difficult sometimes . [SEP] [CLS] these are coming out , well this one comes out easy . [SEP] [CLS] so we ' ##ll take these out . [SEP] [CLS] you know , we had a tool bucket video the other day . [SEP] [CLS] today on garden fork , the tool bucket tour , blah . [SEP] [CLS] and i talked about these little different sets of drill bits i have , drill points , and this is go ##n na come in very handy for this ' ##ca ##use it ' ##s kind of hard to get out . [SEP] [CLS] so i ' ##m go ##n na take my deep , long , put it on my screw gun . [SEP] [CLS] this , to here , it ' ##s nice . [SEP] [CLS] ( drill buzzing ) there might be a screw under one of
[CLS] i ' ##m eric roc ##how , your host . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m go ##n na put some wooden blinds in these windows and i thought i ' ##d make a video and show you guys how to do it . [SEP] [CLS] there ' ##s a couple things you need to pay attention to when ordering and installing blinds , i ' ##ve learned from , let ' ##s just call it experience . [SEP] [CLS] but another di ##y project , if i can do it , you can do it . [SEP] [CLS] ready , here we go . [SEP] [CLS] most of the time , you ' ##re go ##n na be ordering blinds at a store and online , and you ' ##re go ##n na have to provide some measurements . [SEP] [CLS] learn from my mistakes here , okay . [SEP] [CLS] you wan na measure your window , the width of it , in at least three places . [SEP] [CLS] i suggest the bottom , the middle , and the top . [SEP] [CLS] the reason we ' ##re doing this is we want to find the narrow ##est width of the window opening , because you do n ##' ##t wan na install blinds that you just measure down here , and then maybe , the trim bows in half way up , so that , when you drop your blinds and kun ##ck , they get stuck . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s a bad thing . [SEP] [CLS] again , learn from me , someone that ' ##s done that . [SEP] [CLS] you can even just kind of move this all the way up , looking for the narrow ##est width , and that is the number that you provide to the blind ordering people . [SEP] [CLS] you also wan na measure from top to bottom . [SEP] [CLS] that ' ##s a little more straight forward . [SEP] [CLS] go to the top , measure all the way to the bottom . [SEP] [CLS] that number is pretty straight forward . [SEP] [CLS] all right , your blinds have been delivered . [SEP] [CLS] if you have more than one window you ' ##re doing , you ' ##re probably wondering which blinds go where , because a lot of the windows are similar , but the dimensions might be slightly different . [SEP] [CLS] the blind company that i ordered these from puts a label right in here , with the dimensions that you gave for that window . [SEP] [CLS] if you wrote those all down somewhere , on a piece of paper , left window is this , right window is that , you can correspond to this . [SEP] [CLS] you ' ##re also going to get a bag of hardware . [SEP] [CLS] now , usually , you ' ##ll use all the hardware that ' ##s
[CLS] hey , everyone , welcome to garden ##for ##k . [SEP] [CLS] this is kind of a new one for us . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re doing a radiant heat floor system . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re at my friend brian ' ##s house . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ve been helping him reno ##vate a three family house and we ' ##re down in the basement . [SEP] [CLS] they dug out the basement , they ' ##re pouring a new cement slab , we ' ##ve got it all ready and now we ' ##re go ##n na do radiant heat in the concrete slab in the basement which is very , very cool . [SEP] [CLS] we put down gravel and then insulation and then a vapor barrier and the wire mesh for the cement and now we ' ##re ready to run this tub ##ing . [SEP] [CLS] this is the first time we ' ##ve done this . [SEP] [CLS] we have a system that is built for di ##y people . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re go ##n na see how it works out in brian ' ##s house . [SEP] [CLS] [ brian ] it better work . [SEP] [CLS] [ eric ] alright , here we go . [SEP] [CLS] this is called pe ##x , p e x , tub ##ing . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s a new kind of tub ##ing that they use in homes in place of copper pipe and we ' ##re go ##n na hook that up to a distribution manifold . [SEP] [CLS] so , this is a distribution manifold that comes with the kit we bought . [SEP] [CLS] [ brian ] there ' ##s three different loops , but it ' ##s one pump . [SEP] [CLS] [ eric ] one zone , it ' ##s a one zone one zone because of the way it ' ##s set up over here , it ' ##s just , this is temporary , this thing . [SEP] [CLS] the water ' ##s go ##n na come in here and then out here . [SEP] [CLS] so , essentially , one pump going into here , but there ' ##s three different loops coming out . [SEP] [CLS] ( banging ) [ man ] you do n ##' ##t do it with ( mum ##bles ) . [SEP] [CLS] you have to do the rest of the floor though , do n ##' ##t you ? [SEP] [CLS] [ brian ] yeah , there ' ##s three of these runs , so we just took one . [SEP] [CLS] now we have to do the other two . [SEP] [CLS] that ' ##s how this works .

[CLS] hey , everyone , welcome to garden fork . [SEP] [CLS] today , should you use pressure treated lumber in your garden , specifically raised vegetable beds . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m go ##n na answer that today in garden fork , all right ? [SEP] [CLS] first , we got ta throw the ball . [SEP] [CLS] as far as we can . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ve built raised beds with pressure treated lumber , and without . [SEP] [CLS] the regular southern pine ones , i coated with lin ##see ##d oil , and they lasted about 10 years . [SEP] [CLS] you can see here , of what the inside of the bed looked like as i took that one apart . [SEP] [CLS] but there is a new kind of pressure treated lumber out there , that is copper infused , rather than arsenic infused . [SEP] [CLS] and reading online , with some people that actually know what they ' ##re talking about , i think it ' ##s actually okay to use this new copper infused , pressure treated lumber in your vegetable beds . [SEP] [CLS] a 2007 study of the safety of ac ##q published in human and ecological risk assessment concluded that exposure to copper from contact with ac ##q treated wood is not expected to have adverse effects on the health of adults or children . [SEP] [CLS] this is the new copper infused kind , it ' ##ll have a label on the side here telling you about it . [SEP] [CLS] i do n ##' ##t think there ' ##s any of the older , arsenic based stuff for sale anymore , to tell you the truth . [SEP] [CLS] first i wan na say that i am not a scientist , i ' ##m just your average gardener guy . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] you look like a scientist . [SEP] [CLS] i am not a scientist . [SEP] [CLS] ( chuckles ) ( woman laughs ) but i am a real ##ist , all right ? [SEP] [CLS] so here ' ##s a couple of points that i , doing some research , found out . [SEP] [CLS] the copper in the new copper infused treated woods , deter ##s insects . [SEP] [CLS] and copper is actually used as a fungi ##cide in vegetable gardening ... as it is ? [SEP] [CLS] is that the right word ? [SEP] [CLS] anyway , we use now copper as a fungi ##cide for vegetable gardening . [SEP] [CLS] so copper in the wood , i think is okay . [SEP] [CLS] and if a plant absorb ##s too much copper , it ' ##ll die . [SEP] [CLS] so you ' ##re not go ##n na eat it anyway , because it ' ##s dead . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] it ' ##ll regulate it for you . [SEP] [CLS] the fungi
[CLS] part of our dec ##lu ##ttering , or my dec ##lu ##ttering and letting go of stuff ... this is my contractor world here . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ve got some half finished projects doing out on the house , and i ca n ##' ##t really let go of a lot of this lumber , and stuff , but i can organize it , and more importantly , get it up off the floor . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ve got some ( wood clan ##king ) ... oh , i dropped it on my foot ( laughs ) . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ve got some 2 x 3 pieces laying around from a job , and i had to cut some eight foot ##ers short . [SEP] [CLS] and i did n ##' ##t really wan na throw them out , so i thought i could make some brackets , lumber , shelf . [SEP] [CLS] lumber rack brackets out of these . [SEP] [CLS] this , chop saw , couple screw ##s and that mess will be up on that wall . [SEP] [CLS] ( cricket ##s chi ##rp ##ing ) ( dog panting ) ( water splash ##ing ) ( dog panting ) ( saw sc ##ree ##ching ) ( pencil scratching ) ( saw sc ##ree ##ching ) here ' ##s our rough mock ##up of our bunch of scrap 2 x 3 ##s . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m go ##n na drill pile holes through here and here . [SEP] [CLS] this is what i call a flip bit . [SEP] [CLS] it has a screw bit on one end and a drill bit on the other . [SEP] [CLS] ( drill buzzing ) what ' ##s wrong with this picture ? [SEP] [CLS] this has an uneven face cut so when i screwed the two together it ' ##s not at a 90 degree , it ' ##s at a 90 and some change so , red ##o this . [SEP] [CLS] ( drill buzzing ) wow , i ' ##m just go ##n na go out and cut that flat , okay ? [SEP] [CLS] all right , i just cut this off , squared that face up . [SEP] [CLS] so this , will go like that . [SEP] [CLS] ( drill buzzing ) i got this little stop on the end so the lumber wo n ##' ##t fall of here . [SEP] [CLS] ( drill buzzing ) ( dog panting ) ( water splash ##ing ) this is a stud find ##er . [SEP] [CLS] go ##n na find where in the sheet rock the stud ##s are . [SEP] [CLS] i started on what i hope is an empty spot over here . [SEP] [CLS] ( abrupt bee ##p ) ( tool bee ##ping ) mark that . [SEP] [CLS] and then i come back . [SEP] [CLS] ( tool bee ##ping ) so
[CLS] hey , everyone , it ' ##s eric from garden ##for ##k . [SEP] [CLS] this is a really cool raised bed that i ran across . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re at a whole foods in town and country , which is a suburb of st ##. louis . [SEP] [CLS] they have a program where they have this whole kids club and they built this raised bed which i thought was really nice . [SEP] [CLS] so i wanted to show you another raised bed construction . [SEP] [CLS] we have a couple of raised bed videos on our site . [SEP] [CLS] you can click on the links to find that . [SEP] [CLS] this one ' ##s really good for if you ' ##re having a garden on concrete , in a parking lot , or if the soil is contaminated where you want a garden . [SEP] [CLS] i thought this might be good for school groups that their playground is just an asphalt topped thing . [SEP] [CLS] this is made out of these kind of cement blocks , which are used to build decks and things like that . [SEP] [CLS] pressure treated 2 ##x ##4 ##s , and pressure treated pl ##ywood , and then a plastic liner in here . [SEP] [CLS] usually when you ' ##re gardening , you do n ##' ##t want to use pressure treated lumber , but this is building it out of pressure treated lumber , which means that it ' ##s water ##proof , it does n ##' ##t rot as much , and then it has a plastic liner to protect the soil from the chemicals that are doing the pressure treating , the wood pre ##ser ##vati ##ve , as you were . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] would it be good on a roof , or does it weigh too much ? [SEP] [CLS] this is pretty heavy , unless you ' ##re on a flat roof that can bear the weight . [SEP] [CLS] you ' ##d have to check with an engineer about that . [SEP] [CLS] but this is perfect for gardening on cement , basically . [SEP] [CLS] that ' ##s why i thought it was cool . [SEP] [CLS] ( gentle music ) to allow for drainage of the soil when you ' ##re watering or it ' ##s raining , they drilled holes through the plastic , through the pl ##ywood base here , so water can drip back out again . [SEP] [CLS] ( gentle music ) but this looks great . [SEP] [CLS] i just thought it was a really great thing , and i wanted to show it to you . [SEP] [CLS] there ' ##s more gardening videos on our site . [SEP] [CLS] you can sub ##scribe to our show . [SEP] [CLS] click on the sub ##scribe button up there . [SEP] [CLS] add your name to our

[CLS] today on garden ##for ##k , sharpe ##ning lawn ##mo ##wer blades . [SEP] [CLS] you ' ##d be surprised how dull these blades get , and if you have n ##' ##t sharpened them in a while , it ' ##s time to do it . [SEP] [CLS] i do it actually a couple times a year . [SEP] [CLS] the labrador ##s love the lawn ##mo ##wer because i throw the ball while i mo ##w the lawn . [SEP] [CLS] if i can do it , you can do it . [SEP] [CLS] first thing you wan na do , get some food plastic wrap from your kitchen . [SEP] [CLS] so make sure this is sealed really well . [SEP] [CLS] if that could screw back on , that would help . [SEP] [CLS] so take a look at your mo ##wer . [SEP] [CLS] whatever side of the mo ##wer has the gas cap on it , that side is go ##n na be tilted up so we can get to the mo ##wer blade . [SEP] [CLS] we do that so if there ' ##s any gas , it does n ##' ##t spill out the cap . [SEP] [CLS] it gets tilted like that . [SEP] [CLS] alright , inside this mo ##wer is a little dirt ##ier than i usually like . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m the one that prof ##esses you should always be cleaning the underside of your mo ##wer . [SEP] [CLS] but anyway , i ' ##m go ##n na show you how to take off the blade . [SEP] [CLS] get yourself a piece of scrap wood and a cl ##amp . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re go ##n na put this down here to keep the blade from moving when we undo the bolt , un ##sc ##rew the bolt . [SEP] [CLS] so this goes in here like this . [SEP] [CLS] put your wren ##ch on this bolt . [SEP] [CLS] do n ##' ##t use an adjustable wren ##ch . [SEP] [CLS] use the wren ##ch that ' ##s the right size . [SEP] [CLS] if i throw this , will you leave me alone ? [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s in okay shape , but definitely needs sharpe ##ning . [SEP] [CLS] so we ' ##re go ##n na go in the shop , do this up . [SEP] [CLS] this is really brilliant ##ly simple , and the sharpe ##r your blade , the health ##ier your grass because it cuts it clean rather than wa ##cki ##n ' it with a dull piece of metal . [SEP] [CLS] the ball ' ##s coming back . [SEP] [CLS] ( dog barking ) so the easiest way i found to sharpe ##n mo ##wer blades is with a right angle grind ##er that has a grinding wheel attachment . [SEP] [CLS] these are relatively inexpensive these days . [SEP] [CLS]
[CLS] hey everyone , welcome to di ##y garden ##for ##k . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re here in a hallway . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s actually the top of my house , my hallway . [SEP] [CLS] i wan na show you how i get up into the top of this hallway to do painting or repairs . [SEP] [CLS] so , first off , i use one of these adjustable extension ladder ##s . [SEP] [CLS] they come in various brand names , but you can move these up and down , they ' ##re adjustable , they bend all sorts of ways . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re go ##n na just use it as a straight extension ladder . [SEP] [CLS] you could also just use an extension ladder as well . [SEP] [CLS] so if we wan na get up into the top of the hallway you would think oh i ' ##ll just put the ladder , i do n ##' ##t wan na poke a hole in the ceiling , like this right ? [SEP] [CLS] here ##s the problem with that . [SEP] [CLS] the problem is this , if you put down the ladder on the stairs cross ##ways one leg sits on the stair , this other leg has nothing to hold onto . [SEP] [CLS] so i ' ##ve got a solution for that . [SEP] [CLS] first measure across how far out this leg sticks out into the air here , and then add an inch or two . [SEP] [CLS] and then measure how far down it is to the step from that leg as well and write down those two numbers . [SEP] [CLS] so take that width measurement and cut it out of a nice piece of wood . [SEP] [CLS] i used common pine here . [SEP] [CLS] so this is the width again , from the one step of the ladder to the other step of the ladder here . [SEP] [CLS] then that rise or that height measurement , right here . [SEP] [CLS] i cut another piece of wood so we have our rise and our width , and i secured it with a two by three here . [SEP] [CLS] out of some scrap pl ##ywood , i made some triangles . [SEP] [CLS] ( sound of drill ) to give some added strength ( sound of drill ) to our step . [SEP] [CLS] ( sound of drill ) so then figure out where you want to place your ladder and place your step right there . [SEP] [CLS] by the way the usual safety rules apply be very careful with ladder ##s , always have somebody helping you . [SEP] [CLS] this is a use this information at your own risk . [SEP] [CLS] place your ladder , find your step , make sure its secure . [SEP] [CLS] ( music ) ( climbing the ladder )
[CLS] today on garden ##for ##k , first time flux core welding . [SEP] [CLS] make , fix , grow , cook , garden ##for ##k . [SEP] [CLS] hey , it ' ##s me , how you doing , welcome to garden fork . [SEP] [CLS] today i ' ##m working on my new maple syrup eva ##por ##ator and i wanted to show you a tool i have that if you ' ##re thinking about you ' ##d like to do some welding from time to time , you do n ##' ##t need to spend a huge amount of money buying gas and a mig we ##lder and stuff like that . [SEP] [CLS] you can also get an inexpensive flux core we ##lder . [SEP] [CLS] and before everyone piles on me , this is just for occasional stuff . [SEP] [CLS] you wan na fix your mo ##wer deck or something like that . [SEP] [CLS] just wan na show you what i do and maybe you guys might wan na try it as well . [SEP] [CLS] alright , let ' ##s go . [SEP] [CLS] okay , full disclosure , i am an amateur we ##lder . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ve taken a welding class , i learned a lot , but i am , by all means , an amateur . [SEP] [CLS] this is more me trying to get you guys interested in maybe trying welding for yourself , if you ' ##ve never done it , or if you just wan na have a we ##lder rig that from time to time you wan na fix something . [SEP] [CLS] i think this will make you happy . [SEP] [CLS] this is my favorite part , the hood . [SEP] [CLS] this is a 90 amp flux core we ##lder that i got from harbor freight . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s about $ 100 , you might be able to catch it on sale . [SEP] [CLS] what flux core means is that there is flux inside the metal welding wire that comes out of the tip here . [SEP] [CLS] that also means that this thing puts off a lot of smoke , so do this in a well vent ##ila ##ted area . [SEP] [CLS] i usually do it outside or in my garage here . [SEP] [CLS] do n ##' ##t do this inside in a basement shop , okay . [SEP] [CLS] but the beauty of this is it ' ##s inexpensive , it ' ##ll we ##ld thin metals , and with a little practice , you can get really good at this . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m just kind of a rank amateur , but this will really with my eva ##por ##ator . [SEP] [CLS] so i wanted to show you just this welding that i ' ##m go ##n na do and we ' ##ll go from there ,
[CLS] hey everyone , welcome to garden fork . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m you ' ##re host , eric roc ##how . [SEP] [CLS] i could n ##' ##t pass it up . [SEP] [CLS] neighbor had this out in front of his house and i said does it work ? [SEP] [CLS] he goes yeah , it works . [SEP] [CLS] and i did n ##' ##t wan na drag it all the way home if it did n ##' ##t work . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m like you sure it works ? [SEP] [CLS] he goes yeah , it works . [SEP] [CLS] he said that the people that had it in their apartment did n ##' ##t want it anymore , well it was in their backyard , not in their apartment , and that ' ##s like three , four hundred dollars so it ' ##s like well , let ' ##s see . [SEP] [CLS] so it does work but it does n ##' ##t work . [SEP] [CLS] here ' ##s my issue here . [SEP] [CLS] you turn this on , press the button , and this flames up and then the flame goes out in about 10 seconds so there ' ##s clearly something wrong . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s getting gas and then it ' ##s not getting gas . [SEP] [CLS] so the regulator , it regulates the gas flow coming from the tank going into your grill and sometimes it needs to be reset or replaced . [SEP] [CLS] so i ' ##m go ##n na show you a little trick to try and rest the regulator . [SEP] [CLS] now if that does n ##' ##t work , then you can just go and buy replacement regulator at your lo ##cat hardware store , drop it in , and you ' ##re ready to go . [SEP] [CLS] alright , watch this little trick , see what happens . [SEP] [CLS] so i think the cu ##lp ##rit here is the regulator . [SEP] [CLS] that ' ##s the little gi ##z ##mo here . [SEP] [CLS] those things die out kind of just whenever they want . [SEP] [CLS] turn the tank valve off and disco ##nne ##ct the regulator from the tank like that . [SEP] [CLS] now open your hood , turn all your valves to high . [SEP] [CLS] now with the valves open and the tank disconnected , you want to wait one minute , or a little more than a minute . [SEP] [CLS] you can go watch your labrador ##s play . [SEP] [CLS] ( jazz lounge music ) ( barking ) alright , after a minute or more , turn your valves back off again . [SEP] [CLS] rec ##onne ##ct your tank to the regulator . [SEP] [CLS] regulator and line are connected , this is tight . [SEP] [CLS] now slowly , slowly open up
[CLS] ( light music ) ( water splash ##ing ) ( dog panting ) she ' ##s heavy . [SEP] [CLS] hey everyone , welcome to garden fork . [SEP] [CLS] today , lawn mo ##wer tune up . [SEP] [CLS] yeah , believe it or not , you have to tune up your lawn mo ##wer , and if you do , it ' ##ll last a lot longer as well and it ' ##s actually really , pretty dar ##n simple to do . [SEP] [CLS] even i can do it . [SEP] [CLS] yeah who am i anyway ? [SEP] [CLS] if you take care of your lawn mo ##wer , it ' ##s go ##n na last a lot longer . [SEP] [CLS] i mean it ' ##s true you get what you pay for with lawn mo ##wer ##s but if you get a good lawn mo ##wer and you maintain it , it ' ##s go ##n na last quite a long time . [SEP] [CLS] there ' ##s two key things here . [SEP] [CLS] you have to tune it up every year , change the oil a couple times that season and also every time you ' ##re done mo ##wing , you scrape the bottom of it and get all the grass off . [SEP] [CLS] some of them have an attachment where you stick a garden hose on here , and it wash ##es off all the thing underneath the mo ##wer deck . [SEP] [CLS] yeah it is very good . [SEP] [CLS] ideally you ' ##re go ##n na tune up your lawn mo ##wer when you do n ##' ##t have a lot of gas in the gas tank , okay ? [SEP] [CLS] but before we do anything else , look in the front and you ' ##re go ##n na see black cable . [SEP] [CLS] this is the spark plug , and we wan na disco ##nne ##ct that because it ' ##s highly unlikely , but if we somehow accidentally started this thing while we ' ##re maintaining it , it ' ##s a bad thing . [SEP] [CLS] first of all , you want to run your lawn mo ##wer and warm it up before you change your oil . [SEP] [CLS] cause when you warm it up , you ' ##re getting the debris and mu ##ck out of the bottom of the engine . [SEP] [CLS] you ' ##re getting it all stirred up , and the oil will carry it out , because we ' ##re go ##n na drain the oil . [SEP] [CLS] so even if it ' ##s a warm day , it needs to be warmed up more ? [SEP] [CLS] right , you got to warm up your engine . [SEP] [CLS] ( lawn mo ##wer engine running ) you ' ##ve run your lawn mo ##wer about five minutes , you just want
[CLS] hey , how are ya ? [SEP] [CLS] this used to be , well this used to be here then it fell off . [SEP] [CLS] why did it fall off ? [SEP] [CLS] well , because the person who put it on here did n ##' ##t do it as good as we will today , let ' ##s just say that . [SEP] [CLS] the wire broke , the nail came out of the mortar . [SEP] [CLS] so i wan na show today , how to hang picture frames , mirrors , and stuff like that on brick walls . [SEP] [CLS] ready , here we go . [SEP] [CLS] make , fix , grow , cook , garden fork . [SEP] [CLS] are your excited about this , are you ? [SEP] [CLS] ( dog barking ) you ' ##re very excited about this project , all right , let ' ##s go . [SEP] [CLS] all right , let ' ##s talk about stuff that you ' ##re go ##n na need . [SEP] [CLS] the key piece is a hammer drill , we ' ##ll talk more about that . [SEP] [CLS] these are masonry per ##cus ##sive drill bits . [SEP] [CLS] ear protection , dust protection , eye protection . [SEP] [CLS] for this job some plastic anchors , and a vacuum . [SEP] [CLS] so we need to fix this wire here . [SEP] [CLS] let me show you what i ' ##m go ##n na do . [SEP] [CLS] this is a gal ##vani ##zed , braid ##ed hanging wire okay . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m go ##n na take this out . [SEP] [CLS] ( light music ) and i tie a double knot in it . [SEP] [CLS] and i bring this over here . [SEP] [CLS] some people will just fold this , will just wrap this on itself like this and it ' ##ll grab , but i like to tie it . [SEP] [CLS] and now you ' ##re good to go . [SEP] [CLS] so we ' ##re all set , we fixed the mirror wire , we ' ##re go ##n na hang this thing up , drill a hole boom , done , we ' ##re out right , wrong . [SEP] [CLS] we have to kind of talk about the elephant in the room , and that ' ##s the controversy that are on my other videos whether to drill into the brick , or the masonry joint between the brick . [SEP] [CLS] let me show you show you why i drill into the brick . [SEP] [CLS] so here ' ##s out brick wall where we ' ##re go ##n na hang our mirror , right . [SEP] [CLS] brick , mortar , but look here , ( metal scrap ##ping ) i work in old buildings all the time . [SEP] [CLS] but brick is much
[CLS] [ woman ] okay , guys . [SEP] [CLS] hey everyone , welcome to garden ##for ##k . [SEP] [CLS] today , i wanted to show you an inexpensive way to change clear glass to frost ##ed glass . [SEP] [CLS] these are some french doors between two bedrooms . [SEP] [CLS] and instead of buying frost ##ed glass to put in here , for privacy between the two rooms , you can frost it with this frost ##ed glass material . [SEP] [CLS] that you basically lay on the existing glass . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s pretty simple , my sister and i have been doing it , so i wanted to show you how to do it . [SEP] [CLS] [ man ] so first you pre ##cut the frost ##ed material to the size of the window . [SEP] [CLS] this has a cardboard backing on it , and that pulls forward like that , right ? [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] right , and there ' ##s no glue , it ' ##s not sticky . [SEP] [CLS] right , so then you have a spray bottle , this is just an old glass cleaner bottle we had . [SEP] [CLS] and we ... spray some water on there . [SEP] [CLS] and then , we have the texture ##d side facing out . [SEP] [CLS] and we tuck this up in there . [SEP] [CLS] you can pull it back up and lay it back down . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s not like an instant glue or anything . [SEP] [CLS] you can res ##pr ##ay it with water if you want . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] it ' ##s very for ##giving , thank goodness . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] i ' ##ve been doing the cutting . [SEP] [CLS] ( calm music ) and i think old glass pan ##es are imp ##re ##cise , right ? [SEP] [CLS] yeah , these are old . [SEP] [CLS] this is really old , and it ' ##s got a lot of junk on it . [SEP] [CLS] make sure the window is clean first . [SEP] [CLS] and then we take some sort of sq ##ue ##ege ##e . [SEP] [CLS] this is an old pastry sq ##ue ##ege ##e , we have . [SEP] [CLS] and we go across , like that . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] you ' ##re squeezing out the water ? [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re doing this , and i just wanted to share with you all . [SEP] [CLS] so , if you have a big window in a bathroom , and you ' ##re like ... you know , you can still have the beautiful light but you ' ##re go ##n na frost it , and you have the sunlight , but it ' ##s diffuse ##d so people do n ##' ##t need to see your fine ph
[CLS] welcome to version 2 ##. ##0 of the file cabinet maple syrup eva ##por ##ator . [SEP] [CLS] this is charlie pup ' ##s whale . [SEP] [CLS] ( laughs ) are you ready to go ? [SEP] [CLS] do you wan na learn about the eva ##por ##ator ? [SEP] [CLS] [ announcer ] make , fix , grow , cook . [SEP] [CLS] ( instrumental music ) drop . [SEP] [CLS] so , i made kind of a quick ##ie video about this a while ago but , i want to give you a detailed walk through of improvements i ' ##ve made and some improvements that you could make when you build this thing and i always learn from you guys so comments or questions below okay . [SEP] [CLS] let ' ##s take a look . [SEP] [CLS] so our first eva ##por ##ator was steam table pan ##s dropped in a file cabinet . [SEP] [CLS] a bunch of people made them and that was really kinda cool and actually i decided to upgrade so i gave my version one cabinet to my neighbor down the road who ' ##s very happy with that . [SEP] [CLS] but let ' ##s walk through some of the improvements i made . [SEP] [CLS] first of all i just left the pieces of metal between the drawers in here to support the new tray and then i put in , i kept the expanded steel gr ##ating here and you might want to consider using straight sheet metal here instead of the expanded steel and i ' ##ll talk about that a little more later . [SEP] [CLS] the other thing i did was , when you were boiling with version 1 ##. ##0 the steam tunnel trace . [SEP] [CLS] when this thing was whom ##ping , you could n ##' ##t get too close to the cabinet ' ##ca ##use it would melt your pants . [SEP] [CLS] ( laughs ) so i bought inexpensive fire ##brick . [SEP] [CLS] i got these at the blue store . [SEP] [CLS] they ' ##re thin , they look more like a patio brick . [SEP] [CLS] but they ' ##re used for align ##ing wood stove ##s and they were about three bucks a piece if i remember correctly . [SEP] [CLS] they were n ##' ##t really expensive and i put those in here just being held in by gravity . [SEP] [CLS] i did n ##' ##t wire them in or anything but that helped a lot in reflecting the heat back in to the cabinets instead of out and melting my clothes . [SEP] [CLS] it was hot , you would be like [ female ] then you ' ##d have more sewing to do . [SEP] [CLS] ( laughs ) we have a video about sewing machines . [SEP] [CLS] the sewing machines is the original 3 d printer . [SEP]
[CLS] you wan na learn how to install a really simple solar panel set up , pretty inexpensive ? [SEP] [CLS] you can run some stuff in your cabin , or your house , or even your apartment ? [SEP] [CLS] [ camera man ] yeah . [SEP] [CLS] this is a solar panel set up i helped a buddy of mine put together , probably 10 years ago . [SEP] [CLS] is it 10 years , you think ? [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] i do n ##' ##t think it ' ##s been 10 years , but whatever . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s totally di ##y , and it works great . [SEP] [CLS] the most expensive thing is the solar panel and the batteries , but like the wiring and all that , it ' ##s low voltage , we did it ourselves . [SEP] [CLS] so i wan na walk you through it . [SEP] [CLS] ( dogs panting ) this is the back of the solar panel . [SEP] [CLS] it has some electronics here . [SEP] [CLS] and then it has this cord coming out . [SEP] [CLS] what this cord is , this is a outdoor rated heavy duty extension cord that we bought , from the big home improvement store . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ll link to some of them and the solar panel we use , in the notes below the video , here . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] did it used to be yellow ? [SEP] [CLS] yeah , it ' ##s got a little dirt on it , a little mold and stuff . [SEP] [CLS] ( woman laughing ) [ woman ] a decade worth . [SEP] [CLS] but this is really simple . [SEP] [CLS] we picked the part of the yard that had the most sun exposure . [SEP] [CLS] you ' ##re go ##n na have to experiment a little bit and move the panel around . [SEP] [CLS] and then we just put in a simple gal ##vani ##zed pole . [SEP] [CLS] we built a bracket to hold it on , with some pipe , plumbing pipe . [SEP] [CLS] and then , we just did a really simple trench , all the way to the cabin . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] what ' ##re they doin ' ? [SEP] [CLS] they ' ##re look ##in ' for their tennis balls . [SEP] [CLS] so this works best in sunlight , but the beauty of this , is we have some battery storage in the basement of the cabin , which it takes the solar power from the brightest part of the day and stores the electricity so you can use it at night . [SEP] [CLS] you wan na see that ? [SEP] [CLS] okay quick , while she ' ##s looking for the ball . [SEP] [CLS] so we ' ##ve gone from our solar panel ,
[CLS] hey everyone , welcome to garden fork . [SEP] [CLS] this is a video i made a while ago about fixing my rec ##ip ##ro ##cating saw . [SEP] [CLS] i fixed the switch so i ' ##m going to show you how to do that . [SEP] [CLS] what else do i talk about ? [SEP] [CLS] we also have a couple other power tool repair videos . [SEP] [CLS] i fixed my palm sand ##er the other day and i also fixed a circular saw . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s this kinda thing where i hate is throwing things out so i wan na show you all , fix your tools and you ' ##ll have new tools and you saved a bunch of money and you learn something maybe . [SEP] [CLS] ( up ##lifting music ) [ woman ] what you got there ? [SEP] [CLS] this is called a rec ##ip ##ro ##cating saw and my trigger switch is broken . [SEP] [CLS] these are really , really great tools for cutting plumbing pipe or jo ##ist out of a roof or a ceiling . [SEP] [CLS] they ' ##re great for demo ##ing stuff . [SEP] [CLS] what ' ##s really nice if you have to get it up into somewhere , the blades bend , so you can shove it up some where and it goes ( im ##itate ##s blade w ##hir ##ring ) it cuts . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] it does n ##' ##t snap off . [SEP] [CLS] they ' ##ll snap eventually , but i mean the blades are essentially di ##sp ##osa ##ble . [SEP] [CLS] anyway the switch stopped working . [SEP] [CLS] so i went onto the sears website and you can order parts there believe it or not . [SEP] [CLS] so i ordered a switch , it was really , really easy . [SEP] [CLS] yeah i think the switch was three dollars . [SEP] [CLS] the shipping cost more than the switch did . [SEP] [CLS] you know a lot of times people ' ##s tools break and you can fix them . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] you can find them on the street . [SEP] [CLS] generally ... [ woman ] is this plug ##ged in ? [SEP] [CLS] no , no you have to make sure its un ##pl ##ug ##ged . [SEP] [CLS] so we ' ##re go ##n na take these screw ##s out . [SEP] [CLS] to get to our switch here . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] you can do that . [SEP] [CLS] sometimes these screw ##s are really in there , so . [SEP] [CLS] so you take all the screw ##s out . [SEP] [CLS] and sometimes it ' ##s not obvious . [SEP] [CLS] sometimes the screw ##s are hidden underneath labels . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] that metal label ? [SEP] [CLS] well this is a
[CLS] you wan na make the easiest brick pizza oven ever ? [SEP] [CLS] make , fix ... grow , cook . [SEP] [CLS] ( relaxed jazz ##y music ) you wan na go seven bricks across , and you want to center those across the saw horses . [SEP] [CLS] wan na put my nice ##r bricks in the center . [SEP] [CLS] some of these are charred . [SEP] [CLS] you can see these are from our previous pizza oven ##s . [SEP] [CLS] that ' ##s a good sign . [SEP] [CLS] so this is our base . [SEP] [CLS] now we ' ##re go ##n na built our side walls , the back , and the top . [SEP] [CLS] ( relaxed jazz ##y music ) if you got some cement on the end of a brick , you can usually just break it off . [SEP] [CLS] wear some safety glasses , okay ? [SEP] [CLS] and then this will chip off . [SEP] [CLS] ( hammering ) ( scraping ) nice . [SEP] [CLS] ( relaxed jazz ##y music ) so i keep the fire burning in the middle of the oven . [SEP] [CLS] and this looks pretty good here . [SEP] [CLS] i got an old ho ##e , and i just take this whole thing , and i push it back to the back of the oven . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ] do n ##' ##t push it through and we do n ##' ##t , we wan na be careful with the wood . [SEP] [CLS] we do n ##' ##t want a log incident , like we had in a previous episode . [SEP] [CLS] ( woman laughs ) i ' ##ll link to that at the end of the show . [SEP] [CLS] this just makes me look happy , look at this . [SEP] [CLS] the heat here is hot enough that i ca n ##' ##t be too close to this because my hands are burning . [SEP] [CLS] ( scraping ) so i do n ##' ##t mind the coal ash , it ' ##s wood ash okay . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s go ##n na be on the bottom of the pizza , and that ' ##s okay with me . [SEP] [CLS] [ woman ' ##s voice ] oh , there we go . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m go ##n na be making a new pizza dough video . [SEP] [CLS] this was kinda an experiment . [SEP] [CLS] see how it slides on here ? [SEP] [CLS] cause it ' ##s corn ##me ##al , it ' ##s like ball bearings okay . [SEP] [CLS] i mean , this is n ##' ##t a 900 degree oven . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s probably a 400 degree oven , so it might be five minutes a side . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re go ##n na pull it out

[CLS] hey everyone , welcome to garden fork . [SEP] [CLS] i wanted to show you in the shop today , my di ##y ike ##a hack saw table rig , okay . [SEP] [CLS] ( laughing ) these guys are excited . [SEP] [CLS] ( dog barking ) yeah . [SEP] [CLS] ( dog barking ) all right , let ' ##s go , it ' ##s right here . [SEP] [CLS] that roar you hear in the background is our furnace , so if i turn if off , i ' ##ll forget to turn it back on . [SEP] [CLS] this is called a compound mit ##er saw , it ' ##s also called a chop saw . [SEP] [CLS] this one , you can cut things with this . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##ll slide and cut things . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s a very versatile saw . [SEP] [CLS] ( laughing ) the cool thing is , what i ' ##ve done , is i ' ##ve attached a indoor outdoor wet dry va ##c that someone was throwing out , with a little adapt ##er i bought , at the home improvement store , connected to the back of the saw . [SEP] [CLS] i bought this little gi ##z ##mo online , so when the saw trigger is turned on , it automatically turns on the wet dry va ##c . [SEP] [CLS] so we ' ##re go ##n na suck up most of the saw ##dust when we ' ##re cutting , into here automatically , and i do n ##' ##t have to turn on the shop va ##c with a separate switch . [SEP] [CLS] this turns on , this turns on . [SEP] [CLS] you mean you do n ##' ##t have to remember . [SEP] [CLS] you want to see what happens ? [SEP] [CLS] ( electric saw w ##hir ##ring ) ( wet dry va ##c humming ) when this turns on , this unit senses the power draw , and turns on your shop va ##c automatically . [SEP] [CLS] what this does is greatly reduce the amount of saw ##dust that goes flying around your shop . [SEP] [CLS] i mean there ' ##s some here , but ... it ' ##s kind of a neat little di ##y thing . [SEP] [CLS] to top it off , i had an ike ##a rolling wired rack here that i put the shop va ##c in , and i mounted some wood on the top of it here , and i screwed in my chop saw . [SEP] [CLS] what i like about this ( chuckle ) is i can roll this into the corner , when i ' ##m not using it . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s kinda big , but it just makes it a lot easier and you do n ##' ##t have a big table to move around . [SEP]
